A Street.\n\nEnter Iago and Roderigo.\n\nRODERIGO. Tush , never tell me, I take it much unkindly\n\nThat thou, Iago, who hast had my purse,\n\nAs if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this .\n\nIAGO. ’Sblood , but you will not hear me.\n\nIf ever I did dream of such a matter, [5]\n\n Abhor me.\n\nRODERIGO. Thou told’st me, thou didst hold him in thy hate.\n\nIAGO. Despise me if I do not: three great ones of the city,\n\nIn personal suit to make me his lieutenant,\n\nOft capp’d to him, and by the faith of man, [10]\n\nI know my price, I am worth no worse a place.\n\nBut he, as loving his own pride and purposes,\n\n Evade s them, with a bombast circumstance ,\n\n Horribly stuff’d with epithet s of war:\n\nAnd in conclusion , [15]\n\n Nonsuit s my mediator s : for “ Certes ,” says he,\n\n“I have already chosen my officer,”\n\nAnd what was he?\n\n Forsooth , a great arithmetician,\n\nOne Michael Cassio, a Florentine, [20]\n\nA fellow almost damn’d in a fair wife ,\n\nThat never set a squadron in the field,\n\nNor the division of a battle knows,\n\nMore than a spinster , unless the bookish theoric ,\n\nWherein the toged  consuls can propose  [25]\n\nAs masterly as he: mere prattle without practice\n\nIs all his soldiership: but he, sir, had the election,\n\nAnd I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof,\n\nAt Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds,\n\nChristian and heathen , must be l ee ’d , and calm’d, [30]\n\nBy debitor and creditor ; this counter-caster :\n\nHe, in good time, must his lieutenant be,\n\nAnd I, God bless the mark , his worship’s ancient.\n\nRODERIGO. By heaven I rather would have been his hangman.\n\nIAGO. But there’s no remedy, ’tis the curse of service, [35]\n\n Preferment goes by letter and affection ,\n\nNot by the old gradation , where each second\n\nStood heir to the first: now sir, be judge yourself,\n\nWhether I in any just term am affin’d\n\nTo love the Moor.\n\nRODERIGO.    I would not follow him then. [40]\n\nIAGO. O, sir, content you.\n\nI follow him to serve my turn upon him:\n\nWe cannot be all masters, nor all masters\n\nCannot be truly follow’d. You shall mark\n\nMany a duteous and knee-crooking  knave , [45]\n\nThat, doting on his own obsequious  bondage ,\n\nWears out his time much like his master’s ass ,\n\nFor nought  but provender , and when he’s old, cashier’d ,\n\nWhip me such honest knaves: others there are,\n\nWho, trimm’d in forms, and visage s of duty, [50]\n\nKeep yet their hearts attending on themselves,\n\nAnd throwing but shows of service on their lords,\n\nDo well thrive by ’em, and when they have lin’d their coats,\n\nDo themselves homage , those fellows have some soul,\n\nAnd such a one do I profess myself, ... for sir, [55]\n\nIt is as sure as you are Roderigo,\n\nWere I the Moor, I would not be Iago:\n\nIn following him, I follow but myself.\n\nHeaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,\n\nBut seeming so, for my peculiar end. [60]\n\nFor when my outward action does demonstrate\n\n The native act , and figure of my heart,\n\nIn complement extern , ’tis not long after,\n\nBut I will wear my heart upon my sleeve ,\n\nFor dove s to peck at : I am not what I am. [65]\n\nRODERIGO. What a full fortune does the thicklips owe ,\n\nIf he can carry ’t thus!\n\nIAGO.    Call up her father,\n\n Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight,\n\n Proclaim him in the street, incense her kinsmen,\n\nAnd though he in a fertile climate dwell , [70]\n\n Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,\n\nYet throw such changes of vexation on ’t,\n\nAs it may lose some colour.\n\nRODERIGO. Here is her father’s house, I’ll call aloud.\n\nIAGO. Do, with like timorous accent, and dire  yell , [75]\n\nAs when, by night and negligence , the fire\n\nIs spied in populous cities.\n\nRODERIGO. What ho! Brabantio, Signior Brabantio, ho!\n\nIAGO. Awake! what ho, Brabantio! thieves, thieves, thieves!\n\nLook to your house, your daughter, and your bags. [80]\n\nThieves, thieves!\n\n(Brabantio at a window.)\n\nBRABANTIO. What is the reason of this terrible summons ?\n\nWhat is the matter there?\n\nRODERIGO. Signior, is all your family within?\n\nIAGO. Are all doors lock’d?\n\nBRABANTIO.    Why, wherefore ask you this? [85]\n\nIAGO. Zounds , sir, you are robb’d, for shame put on your gown ,\n\nYour heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;\n\nEven now, very now, an old black ram\n\nIs tupping your white ewe ; arise, arise,\n\nAwake the snort ing citizens with the bell, [90]\n\nOr else the devil will make a grandsire of you,\n\nArise I say.\n\nBRABANTIO.    What, have you lost your wits ?\n\nRODERIGO. Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?\n\nBRABANTIO. Not I, what are you?\n\nRODERIGO. My name is Roderigo.\n\nBRABANTIO.    The worse welcome; [95]\n\nI have charg’d thee, not to haunt about my doors;\n\nIn honest plainness thou hast heard me say\n\nMy daughter is not for thee; and now in madness,\n\nBeing full of supper, and distempering  draught s ,\n\nUpon malicious  bravery , dost thou come [100]\n\nTo start my quiet?\n\nRODERIGO. Sir, sir, sir, –\n\nBRABANTIO.    But thou must needs be sure\n\nMy spirit and my place have in them power,\n\nTo make this bitter to thee.\n\nRODERIGO.    Patience, good sir.\n\nBRABANTIO. What, tell’st thou me of robbing? this is Venice, [105]\n\nMy house is not a grange .\n\nRODERIGO.    Most grave Brabantio,\n\nIn simple and pure soul I come to you.\n\nIAGO. Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service, you think we are ruffian s , [110] you’ll have your daughter cover’d with a Barbary horse; you’ll have your nephew s  neigh to you; you’ll have courser s for cousins, and gennet s for german s .\n\nBRABANTIO. What profane  wretch  art thou ? [115]\n\nIAGO. I am one, sir, that comes to tell you, your daughter, and the Moor, are now making the beast with two backs .\n\nBRABANTIO. Thou art a villain .\n\nIAGO.    You are a senator.\n\nBRABANTIO. This thou shalt answer, I know thee, Roderigo. [120]\n\nRODERIGO. Sir, I will answer anything. But I beseech you,\n\nIf’t be your pleasure, and most wise consent ,\n\n(As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter,\n\nAt this odd-even and dull watch o’ the night,\n\nTransported with no worse nor better guard, [125]\n\nBut with a knave of common hire , a gondolier,\n\nTo the gross  clasp s of a lascivious Moor:\n\nIf this be known to you, and your allowance ,\n\nWe then have done you bold and saucy wrongs.\n\nBut if you know not this, my manners tell me, [130]\n\nWe have your wrong rebuke . Do not believe\n\nThat from the sense of all civility ,\n\nI thus would play and trifle with your reverence .\n\nYour daughter (if you have not given her leave ,\n\nI say again), hath made a gross revolt, [135]\n\nTying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes,\n\nIn an extravagant and wheeling stranger,\n\nOf here, and every where: straight satisfy yourself.\n\nIf she be in her chamber , or your house,\n\nLet loose on me the justice of the state [140]\n\nFor this delusion .\n\nBRABANTIO.    Strike on the tinder , ho!\n\nGive me a taper , call up all my people:\n\nThis accident is not unlike my dream,\n\nBelief of it oppresses me already:\n\nLight I say, light!\n\n( Exit above.)\n\nIAGO.    Farewell, for I must leave you: [145]\n\nIt seems not meet , nor wholesome to my place,\n\nTo be produc’d , as if I stay I shall,\n\nAgainst the Moor, for I do know the state,\n\nHowever this may gall him with some check ,\n\nCannot with safety cast him, for he’s embark ’d , [150]\n\nWith such loud reason, to the Cyprus wars,\n\nWhich even now stands in act , that, for their souls,\n\nAnother of his fathom they have not\n\nTo lead their business, in which regard,\n\n Thou gh I do hate him, as I do hell’s pains, [155]\n\nYet, for necessity of present life,\n\nI must show out a flag, and sign of love,\n\nWhich is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,\n\nLead to the Sagittar the raised search,\n\nAnd there will I be with him. So farewell. [160]\n\n(Exit.)\n\n(Enter Brabantio in his night-gown, and Servants with torch es .)\n\nBRABANTIO. It is too true an evil, gone she is,\n\nAnd what’s to come, of my despised time,\n\nIs nought but bitterness. Now Roderigo,\n\nWhere didst thou see her? (O unhappy girl!)\n\nWith the Moor, say’st thou? (Who would be a father?) [165]\n\nHow didst thou know ’twas she? (O thou deceivest me\n\nPast thought!) What said she to you? Get more tapers,\n\nRaise all my kindred , are they married, think you?\n\nRODERIGO. Truly I think they are.\n\nBRABANTIO. O heaven, how got she out? O treason of the blood! [170]\n\nFathers from hence , trust not your daughters’ minds\n\nBy what you see them act, is there not charms,\n\nBy which the property of youth and maidhood\n\nMay be abus’d ? Have you not read, Roderigo,\n\nOf some such thing? [175]\n\nRODERIGO. I have, sir.\n\nBRABANTIO. Call up my brother: O that you had had her!\n\nSome one way, some another; do you know\n\nWhere we may apprehend her, and the Moor?\n\nRODERIGO. I think I can discover him, if you please [180]\n\nTo get good guard, and go along with me.\n\nBRABANTIO. Pray lead me on, at every house I’ll call,\n\nI may command at most: get weapons, ho!\n\nAnd raise some special officers of night:\n\nOn, good Roderigo, I’ll deserve your pains. [185]\n\n( Exeunt .)\n\nScene 2\n\nBefore the Sagittar.\n\nEnter Othello, Iago, and attendants with torches.\n\nIAGO. Though in the trade of war I have slain men,\n\nYet do I hold it very stuff of conscience\n\nTo do no contriv’d murder; I lack iniquity\n\nSometimes to do me service: nine or ten times\n\nI had thought to have yerk ’d him here, under the rib s . [5]\n\nOTHELLO. ’Tis better as it is.\n\nIAGO. Nay , but he prate d ,\n\nAnd spoke such scurvy and provoking terms\n\nAgainst your honour,\n\nThat with the little godliness I have,\n\nI did full hard forbear him: but I pray, sir, [10]\n\nAre you fast married? For be sure of this,\n\nThat the magnifico is much belov’d,\n\nAnd hath in his effect a voice potential\n\nAs double as the duke’s; he will divorce you,\n\nOr put upon you what restraint , and grievance , [15]\n\nThat law (with all his might to enforce it on)\n\nWill give him cable .\n\nOTHELLO.    Let him do his spite ;\n\nMy services, which I have done the signiory ,\n\nShall out-tongue  his complaints; ’tis yet to know –\n\nWhich, when I know that boasting is an honour, [20]\n\nI shall provulgate – I fetch my life and being\n\nFrom men of royal siege , and my demerits\n\nMay speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune\n\nAs this that I have reach’d; for know, Iago,\n\nBut that I love the gentle Desdemona, [25]\n\nI would not my unhoused free condition\n\nPut into circumscription and confine\n\nFor the sea’s worth. But look what lights come yonder .\n\nIAGO. These are the raised father and his friends,\n\nYou were best go in.\n\nOTHELLO.    Not I, I must be found: [30]\n\nMy parts, my title, and my perfect soul,\n\nShall manifest me rightly: is it they?\n\nIAGO. By Janus I think no.\n\n(Enter Cassio, with Officers, and torches.)\n\nOTHELLO. The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.\n\nThe goodness of the night upon you, friends! [35]\n\nWhat is the news?\n\nCASSIO.    The duke does greet you, general,\n\nAnd he requires your haste post- haste appearance,\n\nEven on the instant .\n\nOTHELLO.    What’s the matter, think you?\n\nCASSIO. Something from Cyprus, as I may divine ;\n\nIt is a business of some heat, the galley s  [40]\n\nHave sent a dozen sequent messengers\n\nThis very night, at one another’s heels:\n\nAnd many of the consuls, rais’d and met,\n\nAre at the duke’s already; you have been hotly call’d for,\n\nWhen, being not at your lodging to be found, [45]\n\nThe senate sent about three several quest s\n\nTo search you out.\n\nOTHELLO.    ’Tis well I am found by you:\n\nI will but spend a word here in the house,\n\nAnd go with you.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nCASSIO.    Ancient, what makes he here?\n\nIAGO. Faith , he to-night hath board ed a land carrack : [50]\n\nIf it prove lawful prize , he’s made for ever.\n\nCASSIO. I do not understand.\n\nIAGO.    He’s married.\n\nCASSIO.        To who?\n\n(Enter Othello.)\n\nIAGO. Marry to ... Come, captain, will you go?\n\nOTHELLO.    Ha’ with you.\n\nCASSIO. Here comes another troop to seek for you.\n\n(Enter Brabantio, Roderigo, and others with lights and weapons.)\n\nIAGO. It is Brabantio, general, be advis’d , [55]\n\nHe comes to bad intent .\n\nOTHELLO.    Holla, stand there!\n\nRODERIGO. Signior, it is the Moor.\n\nBRABANTIO.    Down with him, thief!\n\n(They draw on both sides.)\n\nIAGO. You, Roderigo, come sir, I am for you.\n\nOTHELLO. Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust ’em;\n\nGood signior, you shall more command with years [60]\n\nThan with your weapons.\n\nBRABANTIO. O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow ’d my daughter?\n\nDamn’d as thou art, thou hast enchant ed her,\n\nFor I’ll refer me to all things of sense,\n\n(If she in chains of magic were not bound) [65]\n\nWhether a maid, so tender , fair, and happy,\n\nSo opposite to marriage, that she shun n’d\n\nThe wealthy curled darlings of our nation,\n\nWould ever have (to incur a general mock )\n\nRun from her guardage to the sooty  bosom  [70]\n\nOf such a thing as thou? to fear, not to delight.\n\nJudge me the world, if ’tis not gross in sense,\n\nThat thou hast practis’d on her with foul charms,\n\nAbus’d her delicate youth, with drugs or minerals ,\n\nThat weakens motion: I’ll have ’t disputed  on; [75]\n\n’Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.\n\nI therefore apprehend and do attach thee,\n\nFor an abuser of the world, a practiser\n\nOf arts inhibited , and out of warrant ;\n\nLay hold upon him, if he do resist, [80]\n\n Subdue him at his peril .\n\nOTHELLO.    Hold your hands,\n\nBoth you of my inclining and the rest:\n\nWere it my cue to fight, I should have known it,\n\nWithout a prompter ; where will you that I go,\n\nAnd answer this your charge?\n\nBRABANTIO.    To prison, till fit time [85]\n\nOf law, and course of direct session ,\n\nCall thee to answer.\n\nOTHELLO.    What if I do obey?\n\nHow may the duke be therewith satisfied,\n\nWhose messengers are here about my side,\n\nUpon some present business of the state, [90]\n\nTo bear me to him?\n\nOFFICER.    ’Tis true, most worthy signior,\n\nThe duke’s in council , and your noble self,\n\nI am sure is sent for.\n\nBRABANTIO.    How? the duke in council?\n\nIn this time of the night? Bring him away;\n\nMine’s not an idle cause, the duke himself, [95]\n\nOr any of my brothers of the state ,\n\nCannot but feel this wrong, as ’twere their own.\n\nFor if such actions may have passage free,\n\n Bond-slave s , and pagan s , shall our statesmen be.\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nScene 3\n\nA Council Chamber.\n\nEnter Duke and Senators, set at a table with lights and Attendants.\n\nDUKE. There is no composition in these news,\n\nThat gives them credit .\n\nFIRST SENATOR.    Indeed they are disproportion’d ;\n\nMy letters say, a hundred and seven galleys.\n\nDUKE. And mine a hundred and forty.\n\nSECOND SENATOR.    And mine two hundred:\n\nBut though they jump not on a just account , [5]\n\n(As in these cases, where they aim reports ,\n\n’Tis oft with difference,) yet do they all confirm\n\nA Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.\n\nDUKE. Nay, it is possible enough to judgement:\n\nI do not so secure me to the error, [10]\n\nBut the main articles I do approve\n\nIn fearful sense.\n\nSAILOR (within). What ho! what ho! what ho!\n\nOFFICER . A messenger from the galleys.\n\n(Enter Sailor.)\n\nDUKE.    Now, the business?\n\nSAILOR. The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes,\n\nSo was I bid report here, to the state, [15]\n\n By Signior Angelo.\n\nDUKE. How s ay you by this change?\n\nFIRST SENATOR.    This cannot be\n\nBy no assay of reason ... ’tis a pageant ,\n\n To keep us in false gaze : when we consider\n\nThe importancy of Cyprus to the Turk; [20]\n\nAnd let ourselves again but understand,\n\nThat as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,\n\nSo may he with more facile  question bear it,\n\nFor that it stands not in such warlike brace ,\n\nBut altogether lacks the abilities [25]\n\nThat Rhodes is dress’d in . If we make thought of this,\n\nWe must not think the Turk is so unskilful\n\nTo leave that latest, which concerns him first,\n\nNeglecting an attempt of ease, and gain,\n\nTo wake and wage a danger profitless. [30]\n\nDUKE. Nay, in all confidence, he’s not for Rhodes.\n\nOFFICER . Here is more news.\n\n(Enter a Messenger.)\n\nMESSENGER. The Ottomites , reverend and gracious ,\n\nSteering with due course, toward the isle of Rhodes,\n\nHave there injoint ed with an after fleet – [35]\n\nFIRST SENATOR. Ay, so I thought; how many, as you guess?\n\nMESSENGER. Of thirty sail, and now they do re-stem\n\nTheir backward course, bearing with frank appearance\n\nTheir purposes towards Cyprus: Signior Montano,\n\nYour trusty and most valiant  servitor , [40]\n\nWith his free duty recommends you thus,\n\nAnd prays you to believe him.\n\nDUKE. ’Tis certain then for Cyprus;\n\nMarcus Luccicos is not here in town?\n\nFIRST SENATOR. He’s now in Florence. [45]\n\nDUKE. Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch .\n\nFIRST SENATOR. Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.\n\n(Enter Brabantio, Othello, Cassio, Iago, Roderigo, and Officers.)\n\nDUKE. Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you,\n\nAgainst the general enemy Ottoman;\n\n(To Brabantio.)\n\nI did not see you; welcome, gentle signior, [50]\n\nWe lack’d your counsel and your help to-night.\n\nBRABANTIO. So did I yours: good your grace , pardon me,\n\nNeither my place, nor aught I heard of business,\n\nHath rais’d me from my bed, nor doth the general care\n\nTake any hold of me, for my particular grief  [55]\n\nIs of so flood-gate and o’erbearing nature,\n\nThat it englut s and swallows other sorrows,\n\nAnd it is still itself.\n\nDUKE.    Why, what’s the matter?\n\nBRABANTIO. My daughter, O my daughter!\n\nALL.    Dead?\n\nBRABANTIO.        Ay, to me:\n\nShe is abus’d, stol’n from me and corrupted , [60]\n\nBy spell s and medicines, bought of mountebank s ,\n\nFor nature so preposterously to err ,\n\n(Being not deficient , blind, or lame of sense,)\n\n Sans  witchcraft could not.\n\nDUKE. Whoe’er he be, that in this foul proceeding  [65]\n\nHath thus beguil’d your daughter of herself,\n\nAnd you of her, the bloody book of law\n\nYou shall yourself read, in the bitter letter,\n\nAfter its own sense, though our proper son\n\nStood in your action.\n\nBRABANTIO. Humbly I thank your grace; [70]\n\nHere is the man, this Moor, whom now it seems\n\nYour special mandate , for the state-affairs,\n\nHath hither brought.\n\nALL.    We are very sorry for ’t.\n\nDUKE (to Othello). What in your own part can you say to this?\n\nBRABANTIO. Nothing, but this is so. [75]\n\nOTHELLO. Most potent , grave, and reverend signiors,\n\nMy very noble and approv’d good masters:\n\nThat I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter,\n\nIt is most true: true, I have married her,\n\nThe very head and front of my offending  [80]\n\nHath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,\n\nAnd little blest with the set  phrase of peace,\n\nFor since these arms of mine had seven years’ pith ,\n\nTill now some nine moons wasted, they have us’d\n\nTheir dearest action in the tented field, [85]\n\nAnd little of this great world can I speak,\n\nMore than pertains to  feat s of broil , and battle,\n\nAnd therefore little shall I grace my cause,\n\nIn speaking for myself: yet, (by your gracious patience)\n\nI will a round unvarnish’d  tale deliver, [90]\n\nOf my whole course of love, what drugs, what charms,\n\nWhat conjuration , and what mighty magic,\n\n(For such proceedings am I charged withal )\n\nI won his daughter.\n\nBRABANTIO.    A maiden never bold of spirit,\n\nSo still and quiet, that her motion [95]\n\n Blush ’d at her self: and she, in spite of nature,\n\nOf years, of country, credit, everything,\n\nTo fall in love with what she fear’d to look on?\n\nIt is a judgement maim ’d , and most imperfect,\n\nThat will confess perfection so would err [100]\n\nAgainst all rules of nature, and must be driven\n\nTo find out practices of cunning hell,\n\nWhy this should be; I therefore vouch again,\n\nThat with some mixtures powerful o’er the blood,\n\nOr with some dram  conjur’d to this effect, [105]\n\nHe wrought upon her.\n\nDUKE.    To vouch this is no proof,\n\nWithout more certain and more overt test;\n\nThese are thin habit s , and poor likelihoods\n\nOf modern seeming s , you prefer against him.\n\nFIRST SENATOR. But, Othello, speak, [110]\n\nDid you by indirect and forced courses\n\n Subdue  and poison this young maid’s affections?\n\nOr came it by request, and such fair question,\n\nAs soul to soul afford eth ?\n\nOTHELLO.    I do beseech you,\n\nSend for the lady to the Sagittar, [115]\n\nAnd let her speak of me before her father;\n\nIf you do find me foul in her report,\n\nThe trust, the office, I do hold of you,\n\nNot only take away, but let your sentence\n\nEven fall upon my life.\n\nDUKE.    Fetch Desdemona hither. [120]\n\n(Two or three attendants move towards the door.)\n\nOTHELLO (to Iago) . Ancient, conduct them, you best know the place:\n\n(Exeunt Attendants and Iago.)\n\nAnd till she come, as faithful as to heaven\n\nI do confess the vice s of my blood,\n\nSo justly to your grave ears I’ll present\n\nHow I did thrive in this fair lady’s love, [125]\n\nAnd she in mine.\n\nDUKE. Say it, Othello.\n\nOTHELLO. Her father lov’d me, oft invited me,\n\nStill question’d me the story of my life,\n\nFrom year to year; the battles, siege s , fortunes, [130]\n\nThat I have pass’d:\n\nI ran it through, even from my boyish days,\n\nTo the very moment that he bade me tell it.\n\nWherein I spake of most disastrous chances,\n\nOf moving accidents by flood and field; [135]\n\nOf hair-breadth scape s i’ th’ imminent deadly breach ;\n\nOf being taken by the insolent  foe ;\n\nAnd sold to slavery, and my redemption  thence ,\n\nAnd with it all my travel’s history;\n\nWherein of antre s vast, and deserts idle, [140]\n\nRough quarries , rocks and hills, whose heads touch heaven,\n\nIt was my hint  to speak, such was the process:\n\nAnd of the Cannibals, that each other eat;\n\nThe Anthropophagi , and men whose heads\n\nDo grow beneath their shoulders: this to hear [145]\n\nWould Desdemona seriously incline ;\n\nBut still the house-affairs would draw her thence,\n\nAnd ever as she could with haste dispatch ,\n\nShe’ld come again, and with a greedy ear\n\n Devour  up my discourse ; which I observing, [150]\n\nTook once a pliant hour, and found good means\n\nTo draw from her a prayer of earnest heart,\n\nThat I would all my pilgrimage  dilate ,\n\nWhereof by parcel she had something heard,\n\nBut not intentively : I did consent , [155]\n\nAnd often did beguile her of her tears,\n\nWhen I did speak of some distressed stroke\n\nThat my youth suffer’d: my story being done,\n\nShe gave me for my pains a world of sighs;\n\nShe swore i’ faith ’twas strange, ’twas passing strange; [160]\n\n’Twas pitiful , ’twas wondrous pitiful;\n\nShe wish’d she had not heard it, yet she wish’d\n\nThat heaven had made her such a man: she thank’d me,\n\nAnd bade me, if I had a friend that lov’d her,\n\nI should but teach him how to tell my story, [165]\n\nAnd that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:\n\nShe lov’d me for the dangers I had pass’d,\n\nAnd I lov’d her that she did pity them.\n\nThis only is the witchcraft I have us’d:\n\nHere comes the lady, let her witness it. [170]\n\n(Enter Desdemona, Iago, Attendants.)\n\nDUKE. I think this tale would win my daughter too, ...\n\nGood Brabantio,\n\nTake up this mangled matter at the best;\n\nMen do their broken weapons rather use,\n\nThan their bare hands.\n\nBRABANTIO.    I pray you hear her speak. [175]\n\nIf she confess that she was half the wooer,\n\nDestruction light on me, if my bad blame\n\nLight on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress :\n\nDo you perceive in all this noble company,\n\nWhere most you owe  obedience ?\n\nDESDEMONA.    My noble father, [180]\n\nI do perceive here a divided duty:\n\nTo you I am bound for life and education,\n\nMy life and education both do learn me\n\nHow to respect you, you are lord of all my duty,\n\nI am hitherto your daughter: but here’s my husband: [185]\n\nAnd so much duty as my mother show’d\n\nTo you, preferring you before her father,\n\nSo much I challenge , that I may profess,\n\nDue to the Moor my lord.\n\nBRABANTIO. God bu’y , I ha’ done:\n\nPlease it your grace, on to the state-affairs; [190]\n\nI had rather to adopt a child than get it;\n\nCome hither, Moor:\n\nI here do give thee that, with all my heart,\n\nWhich, but thou hast already, with all my heart\n\nI would keep from thee. For your sake (jewel) [195]\n\nI am glad at soul I have no other child,\n\nFor thy escape would teach me tyranny,\n\nTo hang clog s on ’em; I have done, my lord.\n\nDUKE. Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,\n\nWhich as a grise or step may help these lovers [200]\n\nInto your favour.\n\nWhen remedies are past, the griefs are ended,\n\nBy seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.\n\nTo mourn a mischief  that is past and gone,\n\nIs the next way to draw more mischief on. [205]\n\nWhat cannot be preserv’d when fortune takes,\n\nPatience her injury a mockery makes.\n\nThe robb’d that smiles, steals something from the thief,\n\nHe robs himself, that spends a bootless grief.\n\nBRABANTIO. So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile, [210]\n\nWe lose it not so long as we can smile;\n\nHe bears the sentence well, that nothing bears\n\nBut the free comfort which from thence he hears:\n\nBut he bears both the sentence and the sorrow,\n\nThat, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow. [215]\n\nThese sentences to sugar, or to gall ,\n\nBeing strong on both sides, are equivocal :\n\nBut words are words; I never yet did hear\n\nThat the bruis’d heart was pierce d through the ear:\n\nBeseech you now, to the affairs of the state. [220]\n\nDUKE. The Turk with most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus: Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you, and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency , yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effect s , throws a more safer [225] voice on you: you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes, with this more stubborn and boisterous  expedition .\n\nOTHELLO. The tyrant custom , most grave senators,\n\nHath made the flinty and steel couch of war [230]\n\nMy thrice-driven bed of down : I do agnize\n\nA natural and prompt alacrity\n\nI find in hardness, and would undertake\n\nThis present wars against the Ottomites.\n\nMost humbly therefore, bending to your state, [235]\n\nI crave fit disposition for my wife,\n\nDue reference of place, and exhibition ,\n\nWith such accommodation and besort\n\nAs level s with her breeding .\n\nDUKE.    If you please,\n\nBe ’t at her father’s.\n\nBRABANTIO.    I’ll not have it so. [240]\n\nOTHELLO. Nor I.\n\nDESDEMONA.    Nor I, I would not there reside ,\n\nTo put my father in impatient thoughts,\n\nBy being in his eye: most gracious duke,\n\nTo my unfolding lend a gracious ear,\n\nAnd let me find a charter in your voice, [245]\n\nAnd if my simpleness ...\n\nDUKE. What would you ... speak.\n\nDESDEMONA. That I did love the Moor, to live with him,\n\nMy downright  violence , and scorn of fortunes,\n\nMay trumpet to the world: my heart’s subdued [250]\n\nEven to the utmost pleasure of my lord:\n\nI saw Othello’s visage in his mind,\n\nAnd to his honours, and his valiant parts\n\nDid I my soul and fortunes consecrate :\n\nSo that, dear lords, if I be left behind, [255]\n\nA moth of peace, and he go to the war,\n\nThe rite s for which I love him are bereft me,\n\nAnd I a heavy interim shall support,\n\nBy his dear absence; let me go with him.\n\nOTHELLO. Your voices, Lords: beseech you, let her will [260]\n\nHave a free way; I therefore beg it not\n\nTo please the palate of my appetite,\n\nNor to comply with heat, the young affects\n\nIn my defunct , and proper satisfaction,\n\nBut to be free and bounteous of her mind; [265]\n\nAnd heaven defend your good souls that you think\n\nI will your serious and great business scant ,\n\nFor she is with me; ... no, when light-wing’d toys,\n\nAnd feather’d Cupid , foil s with wanton  dullness\n\nMy speculative and active instruments , [270]\n\nThat my disport s corrupt and taint my business,\n\nLet housewives make a skillet of my helm,\n\nAnd all indign and base adversities\n\nMake head against my reputation !\n\nDUKE. Be it, as you shall privately determine, [275]\n\nEither for stay or going, the affairs cry haste,\n\nAnd speed must answer; you must hence to-night.\n\nDESDEMONA. To-night, my Lord?\n\nDUKE.    This night.\n\nOTHELLO.        With all my heart.\n\nDUKE. At ten i’ the morning here we’ll meet again.\n\nOthello, leave some officer behind, [280]\n\nAnd he shall our commission bring to you,\n\nWith such things else of quality or respect\n\nAs doth concern you.\n\nOTHELLO.    Please your grace, my ancient,\n\nA man he is of honesty and trust,\n\nTo his conveyance I assign my wife, [285]\n\nWith what else needful your good grace shall think\n\nTo be sent after me.\n\nDUKE.    Let it be so.\n\nGood night to every one; and, noble signior,\n\nIf virtue no delighted beauty lack,\n\nYour son-in-law is far more fair than black. [290]\n\nFIRST SENATOR. Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.\n\nBRABANTIO. Look to her, Moor, have a quick eye to see:\n\nShe has deceiv’d her father, may do thee.\n\n(Exeunt Duke, Senators, Officers, etc.)\n\nOTHELLO. My life upon her faith: honest Iago,\n\nMy Desdemona must I leave to thee; [295]\n\n I prithee , let thy wife attend on her,\n\nAnd bring her after in the best advantage ;\n\nCome, Desdemona, I have but an hour\n\nOf love, of worldly matters, and direction,\n\nTo spend with thee; we must obey the time. [300]\n\n(Exeunt Othello and Desdemona.)\n\nRODERIGO. Iago!\n\nIAGO. What sayest thou, noble heart?\n\nRODERIGO. What will I do, thinkest thou?\n\nIAGO. Why, go to bed and sleep.\n\nRODERIGO. I will incontinently  drown myself . [305]\n\nIAGO. Well, if thou doest, I shall never love thee after it. Why, thou silly gentleman?\n\nRODERIGO. It is silliness to live, when to live is a torment ; and then we have a prescription to die, when death is our physician . [310]\n\nIAGO. O villainous ! I ha’ look’d upon the world for four times seven years, and since I could distinguish between a benefit and an injury , I never found a man that knew how to love himself: ere  I would say I would drown myself, for the love of a guinea-hen , [315] I would change my humanity with a baboon .\n\nRODERIGO. What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not in my virtue to amend it.\n\nIAGO. Virtue? a fig! ’tis in ourselves, that we are thus, [320] or thus: our bodies are gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners, so that if we will plant nettle s , or sow lettuce, set hyssop , and weed up  thyme ; supply it with one gender of herbs , or distract it with many; either to have it sterile with idleness, or manur’d  [325] with industry , why, the power, and corrigible authority of this, lies in our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason, to poise another of sensuality , the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous [330] conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal  sting s , our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you call love, to be a sect , or scion .\n\nRODERIGO. It cannot be.\n\nIAGO. It is merely a lust of the blood, and a permission [335] of the will. Come, be a man; drown thyself? drown cats and blind puppies : I profess me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving , with cables of perdurable toughness; I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow these [340] wars, defeat thy favour with an usurp’d beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love unto the Moor, ... put money in thy purse, ... nor he to her; it was a ­violent commencement , and thou shalt see an [345] answerable sequestration : put but money in thy purse ... These Moors are changeable in their wills: ... fill thy purse with money. The food that to him now is as luscious  as locust s , shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida . When she is sated with [350] his body, she will find the error of her choice; she must have change, she must. Therefore put money in thy purse: if thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning; make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony , and a frail  vow , [355] betwixt an erring barbarian, and a super-subtle Venetian, be not too hard for my wits, and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money, ... a pox o’ drowning, ’tis clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be hang’d in [360] compassing thy joy, than to be drown’d, and go without her.\n\nRODERIGO. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes?\n\nIAGO. Thou art sure of me ... go, make money ... I have told thee often, and I tell thee again, and again, I [365] hate the Moor; my cause is hearted, thine has no less reason, let us be communicative in our revenge against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou doest thyself a pleasure, and me a sport . There are many events in the womb of time, which will be [370]  deliver ed .  Traverse , go, provide thy money, we will have more of this tomorrow; adieu.\n\nRODERIGO. Where shall we meet i’ the morning?\n\nIAGO. At my lodging.\n\nRODERIGO. I’ll be with thee betimes . [375]\n\nIAGO. Go to, farewell: ... do you hear, Roderigo?\n\nRODERIGO. What say you?\n\nIAGO. No more of drowning, do you hear?\n\nRODERIGO. I am chang’d.\n\nIAGO. Go to; farewell! put money enough in your [380] purse.\n\n(Exit Roderigo.)\n\nThus do I ever make my fool my purse:\n\nFor I mine own gain’d knowledge should profane ,\n\nIf I would time expend with such a snipe ,\n\nBut for my sport and profit: I hate the Moor, [385]\n\nAnd it is thought abroad , that ’twixt my sheets\n\nHe’s done my office ; I know not if ’t be true ...\n\nYet I, for mere suspicion in that kind,\n\nWill do, as if for surety : he holds me well,\n\nThe better shall my purpose work on him. [390]\n\nCassio’s a proper man, let me see now,\n\nTo get this place, and to make up my will,\n\nA double knavery ... how, how? ... let me see,\n\nAfter some time, to abuse Othello’s ear,\n\nThat he is too familiar with his wife: [395]\n\nHe has a person and a smooth dispose ,\n\nTo be suspected , fram’d to make women false:\n\nThe Moor a free and open nature too,\n\nThat thinks men honest that but seem to be so:\n\nAnd will as tenderly be led by the nose ... [400]\n\nAs asses are.\n\nI ha’t, it is engender ’d ; Hell and night\n\nMust bring this monstrous birth to the world’s light.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nAct II\n\nScene 1\n\nA Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the Quay.\n\nEnter Montano, with two other Gentlemen.\n\nMONTANO. What from the cape can you discern at sea?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN. Nothing at all, it is a high-wrought flood,\n\nI cannot ’twixt the heaven and the main\n\n Descry  a sail.\n\nMONTANO. Methinks the wind does speak aloud at land, [5]\n\nA fuller blast ne’er shook our battlements :\n\nIf it ha’ ruffian ’d so upon the sea,\n\nWhat ribs of oak , when the huge mountains melt ,\n\nCan hold the mortise ? ... What shall we hear of this?\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN. A segregation of the Turkish fleet: [10]\n\nFor do but stand upon the banning shore,\n\nThe chiding  billow seems to pelt the clouds,\n\nThe wind-shak’d surge , with high and monstrous main,\n\nSeems to cast water on the burning bear ,\n\nAnd quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole ; [15]\n\nI never did like molestation view\n\nOn the enchafed flood.\n\nMONTANO.    If that the Turkish fleet\n\nBe not enshelter’d , and embay’d , they are drown’d,\n\nIt is impossible they bear it out.\n\n(Enter a third Gentleman.)\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN. News, lords, your wars are done: [20]\n\nThe desperate  tempest hath so bang ’d the Turk,\n\nThat their designment halts: another ship, of Venice,\n\nHath seen a grievous  wrack and sufferance\n\nOn most part of the fleet.\n\nMONTANO. How, is this true?\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.    The ship is here put in, [25]\n\nA Veronesa ; Michael Cassio,\n\nLieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,\n\nIs come ashore: the Moor himself at sea,\n\nAnd is in full commission here for Cyprus.\n\nMONTANO. I am glad on ’t, ’tis a worthy governor. [30]\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN. But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort,\n\nTouching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,\n\nAnd prays the Moor be safe, for they were parted,\n\nWith foul and violent tempest.\n\nMONTANO.    Pray heaven he be:\n\nFor I have serv’d him, and the man commands [35]\n\nLike a full soldier: let’s to the seaside, ho!\n\nAs well to see the vessel that’s come in,\n\nAs to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,\n\nEven till we make the main and the aerial blue\n\nAn indistinct regard.\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.    Come, let’s do so, [40]\n\nFor every minute is expectancy\n\nOf more arrivance .\n\n(Enter Cassio.)\n\nCASSIO. Thanks to the valiant of this worthy isle,\n\nThat so approve the Moor, and let the heavens\n\nGive him defence against their elements, [45]\n\nFor I have lost him on a dangerous sea.\n\nMONTANO. Is he well shipp’d?\n\nCASSIO. His bark is stoutly  timber ’d , and his pilot\n\nOf very expert and approv’d allowance,\n\nTherefore my hopes, not surfeited to death, [50]\n\nStand in bold cure .\n\n(Within:  “A sail, a sail, a sail!”)\n\n(Enter a Messenger.)\n\nCASSIO. What noise?\n\nMESSENGER. The town is empty, on the brow o’ the sea\n\nStand ranks of people, and they cry “A sail!”\n\nCASSIO. My hopes do shape him for the governor. [55]\n\n(A shot.)\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN. They do discharge the shot of courtesy ,\n\nOur friend at least.\n\nCASSIO.    I pray you sir go forth,\n\nAnd give us truth, who ’tis that is arriv’d.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN. I shall.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nMONTANO. But, good lieutenant, is your general wiv’d ? [60]\n\nCASSIO. Most fortunately, he hath achiev’d a maid\n\nThat paragon s description, and wild fame :\n\nOne that excels the quirk s of blazon ing pens,\n\nAnd in the essential vesture  of creation\n\nDoes bear all excellency: ...\n\n(Enter Second Gentleman.)\n\nNow, who has put in? [65]\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN. ’Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.\n\nCASSIO. He has had most favourable and happy speed :\n\nTempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,\n\nThe gutter’d rocks, and congregated sands,\n\n Traitor s  ensteep’d , to clog the guiltless  keel , [70]\n\nAs having sense of beauty, do omit\n\nTheir common natures, letting go safely by\n\nThe divine Desdemona.\n\nMONTANO.    What is she?\n\nCASSIO. She that I spoke of, our great captain’s captain,\n\nLeft in the conduct of the bold Iago; [75]\n\nWhose footing here anticipate s our thoughts\n\nA se’nnight’s speed ... Great Jove , Othello guard,\n\nAnd swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,\n\nThat he may bless this bay with his tall ship,\n\nAnd swiftly come to Desdemona’s arms, [80]\n\n(Enter Desdemona, Iago, Emilia, and Roderigo.)\n\nGive renew’d fire to our extincted spirits,\n\nAnd bring all Cyprus comfort, ...\n\nO, behold ,\n\nThe riches of the ship is come ashore!\n\nYe men of Cyprus, let her have your knees:\n\nHail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven, [85]\n\nBefore, behind thee, and on every hand,\n\n Enwheel thee round!\n\nDESDEMONA.    I thank you, valiant Cassio:\n\nWhat tidings can you tell me of my lord?\n\nCASSIO. He is not yet arriv’d, nor know I aught,\n\nBut that he’s well, and will be shortly here. [90]\n\nDESDEMONA. O, but I fear: ... how lost you company?\n\n(Within: “A sail, a sail!”)\n\nCASSIO. The great contention of the sea and skies\n\nParted our fellowship: but, hark ! a sail.\n\n(A shot.)\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN. They give their greeting to the citadel,\n\nThis likewise is a friend.\n\nCASSIO.    So speaks this voice. [95]\n\nGood ancient, you are welcome, (to Emilia) welcome, mistress:\n\nLet it not gall your patience, good Iago,\n\nThat I extend my manners; ’tis my breeding\n\nThat gives me this bold show of courtesy.\n\n(Kissing her.)\n\nIAGO. Sir, would she give you so much of her lips [100]\n\nAs of her tongue she has bestow’d on me,\n\nYou’ld have enough.\n\nDESDEMONA. Alas ! she has no speech.\n\nIAGO. I know, too much:\n\nI find it, I; for when I ha’ list to sleep –\n\n Marry , before your ladyship, I grant , [105]\n\nShe puts her tongue a little in her heart,\n\nAnd chides with thinking.\n\nEMILIA. You ha’ little cause to say so.\n\nIAGO. Come on, come on, you are pictures out o’ doors;\n\nBells in your parlour s ; wild-cats in your kitchens; [110]\n\nSaints in your injuries; devils being offended;\n\nPlayers in your housewifery ; and housewives in your beds.\n\nDESDEMONA. O, fie upon thee, slanderer !\n\nIAGO. Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk,\n\nYou rise to play, and go to bed to work. [115]\n\nEMILIA. You shall not write my praise.\n\nIAGO.    No, let me not.\n\nDESDEMONA. What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me?\n\nIAGO. O gentle lady, do not put me to ’t,\n\nFor I am nothing, if not critical.\n\nDESDEMONA. Come on, assay ... there’s one gone to the harbour? [120]\n\nIAGO. Ay, madam.\n\nDESDEMONA. I am not merry, but I do beguile\n\nThe thing I am, by seeming otherwise:\n\nCome, how wouldst thou praise me?\n\nIAGO. I am about it, but indeed my invention [125]\n\nComes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze ,\n\nIt plucks out brain and all: but my Muse labour s ,\n\nAnd thus she is deliver’d:\n\nIf she be fair and wise, fairness and wit;\n\nThe one’s for use, the other using it. [130]\n\nDESDEMONA. Well prais’d! How if she be black and witty?\n\nIAGO. If she be black, and thereto have a wit,\n\nShe’ll find a white, that shall her blackness hit.\n\nDESDEMONA. Worse and worse.\n\nEMILIA. How if fair and foolish? [135]\n\nIAGO. She never yet was foolish, that was fair,\n\nFor even her folly help’d her, to an heir.\n\nDESDEMONA. These are old paradoxes, to make fools laugh i’ the alehouse ; what miserable praise hast thou for her that’s foul and foolish? [140]\n\nIAGO. There’s none so foul, and foolish thereunto,\n\nBut does foul prank s , which fair and wise ones do.\n\nDESDEMONA. O heavy ignorance, that praises the worst best: but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed? one that in the [145] authority of her merit s did justly put on the vouch of very malice  itself?\n\nIAGO. She that was ever fair, and never proud,\n\nHad tongue at will, and yet was never loud,\n\nNever lack’d gold, and yet went never gay, [150]\n\n Fled from her wish, and yet said “Now I may;”\n\nShe that, being anger’d, her revenge being nigh ,\n\nBade her wrong stay, and her displeasure fly;\n\nShe that in wisdom never was so frail\n\nTo change the cod ’s head for the salmon ’s tail; [155]\n\nShe that could think, and ne’er disclose her mind,\n\nSee suitor s following, and not look behind;\n\nShe was a wight , if ever such wight were –\n\nDESDEMONA. To do what?\n\nIAGO. To suckle fools, and chronicle  small beer . [160]\n\nDESDEMONA. O most lame and impotent conclusion: do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband; how say you, Cassio, is he not a most profane and liberal  counsellor ?\n\nCASSIO. He speaks home , madam, you may relish him [165] more in the soldier than in the scholar.\n\nIAGO (aside). He takes her by the palm ; ay, well said, whisper: as little a web as this will ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do: I will catch you in your own courtesies: you say true, ’tis so indeed. If [170] such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry , it had been better you had not kiss’d your three fingers so oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in: good, well kiss’d, an excellent courtesy; ’tis so indeed: yet again, your fingers at your [175] lips? would they were clyster-pipe s for your sake ... (Trumpets within.) The Moor, I know his trumpet.\n\nCASSIO. ’Tis truly so.\n\nDESDEMONA. Let’s meet him, and receive him.\n\n(Enter Othello and Attendants.)\n\nCASSIO. Lo , where he comes! [180]\n\nOTHELLO. O my fair warrior!\n\nDESDEMONA.    My dear Othello!\n\nOTHELLO. It gives me wonder great as my content\n\nTo see you here before me: O my soul’s joy,\n\nIf after every tempest come such calmness,\n\nMay the winds blow, till they have waken’d death, [185]\n\nAnd let the labouring bark climb hills of seas,\n\n Olympus-high , and duck again as low\n\nAs hell’s from heaven. If it were now to die,\n\n’Twere now to be most happy, for I fear\n\nMy soul hath her content so absolute, [190]\n\nThat not another comfort, like to this\n\nSucceeds in unknown fate.\n\nDESDEMONA.    The heavens forbid\n\nBut that our loves and comforts should increase,\n\nEven as our days do grow.\n\nOTHELLO.    Amen to that, sweet powers!\n\nI cannot speak enough of this content, [195]\n\nIt stops me here, it is too much of joy:\n\nAnd this, and this, the greatest discord be\n\n(They kiss.)\n\nThat e’er our hearts shall make!\n\nIAGO (aside). O, you are well tun’d now,\n\nBut I’ll set down the peg s that make this music,\n\nAs honest as I am.\n\nOTHELLO.    Come, let us to the castle. [200]\n\nNews, friends, our wars are done, the Turks are drown’d\n\nHow do our old acquaintance of the isle?\n\n Honey , you shall be well desir’d in Cyprus;\n\nI have found great love amongst them: O my sweet,\n\nI prattle out of fashion, and I dote [205]\n\nIn mine own comforts: I prithee, good Iago,\n\nGo to the bay, and disembark my coffer s ;\n\nBring thou the master to the citadel;\n\nHe is a good one, and his worthiness\n\nDoes challenge much respect: come, Desdemona, [210]\n\nOnce more well met at Cyprus.\n\n(Exeunt all but Iago and Roderigo.)\n\nIAGO. Do thou meet me presently at the harbour: come hither. If thou be’st valiant – as, they say, base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them – list me; the [215] lieutenant to-night watches on the court of guard: first, I will tell thee this, Desdemona is directly in love with him.\n\nRODERIGO. With him? why, ’tis not possible.\n\nIAGO. Lay thy finger thus , and let thy soul be [220] instructed: mark me, with what violence she first lov’d the Moor, but for bragging , and telling her fantastical lies; and will she love him still for prating? let not the discreet heart think so. Her eye must be fed, and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? [225] When the blood is made dull with the act of sport , there should be again to inflame it, and give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour, sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which the Moor is defective in : now, for want of these requir’d [230]  convenience s , her delicate tenderness will find itself abus’d, begin to heave the gorge , disrelish and abhor the Moor, very nature will instruct her to it, and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and unforc’d position) who [235] stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? a knave very voluble , no farther conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing of his salt and hidden affection s : a subtle  slippery  [240] knave, a finder out of occasions; that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit the true advantages never present themselves. Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after; a pestilent  complete [245] knave, and the woman has found him already.\n\nRODERIGO. I cannot believe that in her, she’s full of most blest condition.\n\nIAGO. Blest fig’s-end ! the wine she drinks is made of grapes: if she had been blest, she would never have [250] lov’d the Moor. Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand?\n\nRODERIGO. Yes, but that was but courtesy.\n\nIAGO. Lechery , by this hand : an index and prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts: they met so [255] near with their lips, that their breaths embrac’d together. When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the main exercise, the incorporate conclusion. But, sir, be you rul’d by me, I have brought you from Venice: watch you to-night, for [260] your command, I’ll lay ’t upon you, Cassio knows you not, I’ll not be far from you, do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other cause you please; which the time shall more [265] favourably minister .\n\nRODERIGO. Well.\n\nIAGO. Sir, he is rash , and very sudden in choler , and haply with his truncheon may strike at you: provoke him that he may, for even out of that will I cause [270] these of Cyprus to mutiny , whose qualification shall come into no true trust again, but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them, and the impediment most profitably [275] remov’d, without which there were no expectation of our prosperity .\n\nRODERIGO. I will do this, if I can bring it to any opportunity.\n\nIAGO. I warrant thee, meet me by and by at the citadel: [280] I must fetch his necessaries ashore ... Farewell.\n\nRODERIGO. Adieu.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nIAGO. That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;\n\nThat she loves him, ’tis apt and of great credit:\n\nThe Moor, howbe’t that I endure him not, [285]\n\nIs of a constant, noble, loving nature;\n\nAnd I dare think, he’ll prove to Desdemona\n\nA most dear husband: now I do love her too,\n\nNot out of absolute lust, (though peradventure\n\nI stand accountant for as great a sin) [290]\n\nBut partly led to diet my revenge,\n\nFor that I do suspect the lustful Moor\n\nHath leap’d into my seat, the thought whereof\n\nDoth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards ,\n\nAnd nothing can, nor shall content my soul, [295]\n\nTill I am even with him, wife, for wife:\n\nOr failing so, yet that I put the Moor,\n\nAt least, into a jealousy so strong,\n\nThat judgement cannot cure; which thing to do,\n\nIf this poor trash  of Venice, whom I trash  [300]\n\nFor his quick hunting, stand the putting on ,\n\nI’ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip ,\n\nAbuse him to the Moor, in the rank garb\n\n(For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too)\n\nMake the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me, [305]\n\nFor making him egregiously an ass,\n\nAnd practising upon his peace and quiet,\n\nEven to madness: ’tis here, but yet confus’d;\n\nKnavery’s plain face is never seen, till us’d.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nScene 2\n\nThe same.\n\nEnter Othello’s Herald reading a proclamation.\n\nHERALD. It is Othello’s pleasure; our noble and valiant general, that upon certain tidings now arrived, import ing the mere  perdition of the Turkish fleet; that every man put himself into triumph: some to dance, some make bonfire s ; each man to what sport [5] and revel s his mind leads him; for besides these beneficial news, it is the celebration of his nuptials . So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full liberty, from this present hour of five, till the bell hath told eleven. [10] Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus, and our noble general Othello!\n\n(Exit.)\n\nScene 3\n\nA Hall in the Castle.\n\nEnter Othello, Cassio, and Desdemona.\n\nOTHELLO. Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:\n\nLet’s teach ourselves the honourable stop ,\n\nNot to outsport  discretion .\n\nCASSIO. Iago hath directed what to do:\n\nBut notwithstanding  with my personal eye [5]\n\nWill I look to it.\n\nOTHELLO.    Iago is most honest,\n\nMichael, good night, to-morrow with your earliest,\n\nLet me have speech with you; come, my dear love,\n\nThe purchase made, the fruits are to ensue ,\n\nThe profit’s yet to come ’twixt me and you. [10]\n\nGood night.\n\n(Exeunt Othello and Desdemona.)\n\n(Enter Iago . )\n\nCASSIO. Welcome, Iago, we must to the watch.\n\nIAGO. Not this hour, lieutenant, ’tis not yet ten o’ clock: our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona, who let us not therefore blame : [15] he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and she is sport for Jove.\n\nCASSIO. She is a most exquisite lady.\n\nIAGO. And I’ll warrant her full of game .\n\nCASSIO. Indeed she is a most fresh and delicate creature. [20]\n\nIAGO. What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of provocation.\n\nCASSIO. An inviting eye, and yet methinks right modest.\n\nIAGO. And when she speaks, ’tis an alarm to love.\n\nCASSIO. She is indeed perfection. [25]\n\nIAGO. Well, happiness to their sheets! ... Come, lieutenant, I have a stoup of wine, and here without are a brace  of Cyprus gallant s , that would fain have a measure to the health of the black Othello.\n\nCASSIO. Not to-night, good Iago; I have very poor and [30] unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment .\n\nIAGO. O, they are our friends, ... but one cup: I’ll drink for you. [35]\n\nCASSIO. I ha’ drunk but one cup to-night, and that was craftily  qualified too, and behold what innovation it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity , and dare not task my weakness with any more.\n\nIAGO. What, man, ’tis a night of revels, the gallants [40] desire it.\n\nCASSIO. Where are they?\n\nIAGO. Here at the door, I pray you call them in.\n\nCASSIO. I’ll do’t, but it dislikes me.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nIAGO. If I can fasten but one cup upon him, [45]\n\nWith that which he hath drunk to-night already,\n\nHe’ll be as full of quarrel and offence\n\nAs my young mistress’ dog: ... Now my sick fool Roderigo,\n\nWhom love has turn’d almost the wrong side outward,\n\nTo Desdemona hath to-night carous’d  [50]\n\n Potation s  pottle-deep , and he’s to watch:\n\nThree lad s of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,\n\nThat hold their honour in a wary distance,\n\nThe very elements of this warlike isle,\n\nHave I to-night fluster ’d with flowing cups, [55]\n\nAnd they watch too: now, ’mongst this flock of drunkard s ,\n\nI am to put our Cassio in some action\n\nThat may offend the isle.\n\n(Enter Montano, Cassio, and others.)\n\nBut here they come:\n\nIf consequence do but approve my dream,\n\nMy boat sails freely, both with wind and stream. [60]\n\nCASSIO. ’Fore God they have given me a rouse already.\n\nMONTANO. Good faith, a little one, not past a pint ,\n\nAs I am a soldier.\n\nIAGO. Some wine, ho!\n\n(Sings.)\n\nAnd let me the cannikin clink, clink, [65]\n\nAnd let me the cannikin clink, clink:\n\nA soldier’s a man,\n\nA life’s but a span ,\n\nWhy then let a soldier drink.\n\nSome wine, boys! [70]\n\nCASSIO. ’Fore God an excellent song.\n\nIAGO. I learn’d it in England, where indeed they are most potent in potting : your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander, – drink, ho! – are nothing to your English. [75]\n\nCASSIO. Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?\n\nIAGO. Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain ; he gives your Hollander a vomit  ere the next pottle can be fill’d. [80]\n\nCASSIO. To the health of our general!\n\nMONTANO. I am for it, lieutenant, and I will do you justice.\n\nIAGO. O sweet England!\n\n(Sings.)\n\nKing Stephen was a worthy peer ,\n\nHis breeches cost him but a crown; [85]\n\nHe held ’em sixpence all too dear,\n\nWith that he call’d the tailor  lown ,\n\nHe was a wight of high renown ,\n\nAnd thou art but of low degree,\n\n’Tis pride that pulls the country down, [90]\n\nThen take thine owd cloak about thee .\n\nSome wine, ho!\n\nCASSIO. ’Fore God this is a more exquisite song than the other.\n\nIAGO. Will you hear’t again?\n\nCASSIO. No, for I hold him unworthy of his place, that [95] does those things: well, God’s above all, and there be souls that must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.\n\nIAGO. It is true, good lieutenant.\n\nCASSIO. For mine own part, no offence to the general, [100] nor any man of quality, I hope to be saved.\n\nIAGO. And so do I, lieutenant.\n\nCASSIO. Ay, but by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let’s ha’ no more of this, let’s to our affairs: God forgive us our [105] sins! Gentlemen, let’s look to our business. Do not think gentlemen I am drunk, this is my ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my left hand: I am not drunk now, I can stand well enough, and speak well enough. [110]\n\nALL. Excellent well.\n\nCASSIO. Very well then; you must not think, that I am drunk.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nMONTANO. To the platform , masters. Come, let’s set the watch.\n\nIAGO. You see this fellow that is gone before, [115]\n\nHe is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar,\n\nAnd give direction: and do but see his vice,\n\n’Tis to his virtue a just equinox ,\n\nThe one as long as th’ other: ’tis pity of him,\n\nI fear the trust Othello put him in, [120]\n\nOn some odd time of his infirmity,\n\nWill shake this island.\n\nMONTANO.    But is he often thus?\n\nIAGO. ’Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:\n\nHe’ll watch the horologe a double set,\n\nIf drink rock not his cradle .\n\nMONTANO.    ’Twere well [125]\n\nThe general were put in mind of it;\n\nPerhaps he sees it not, or his good nature\n\nPraises the virtues that appear in Cassio,\n\nAnd looks not on his evils: is not this true?\n\n(Enter Roderigo.)\n\nIAGO (aside to him). How now, Roderigo, [130]\n\nI pray you, after the lieutenant, go.\n\n(Exit Roderigo.)\n\nMONTANO. And ’tis great pity that the noble Moor\n\nShould hazard such a place as his own second\n\nWith one of an ingraft infirmity:\n\nIt were an honest action to say so [135]\n\nTo the Moor.\n\nIAGO.    Not I, for this fair island:\n\nI do love Cassio well, and would do much\n\n(Cry within: “Help! help!”)\n\nTo cure him of this evil: – but hark, what noise?\n\n(Enter Cassio, driving in Roderigo.)\n\nCASSIO. Zounds, you rogue , you rascal !\n\nMONTANO. What’s the matter, lieutenant? [140]\n\nCASSIO. A knave, teach me my duty! But I’ll beat the knave into a wicker bottle.\n\nRODERIGO. Beat me?\n\nCASSIO. Dost thou prate, rogue?\n\n(Striking Roderigo.)\n\nMONTANO. Good lieutenant; pray sir, hold your hand. [145]\n\nCASSIO. Let me go, sir, or I’ll knock you o’er the mazzard .\n\nMONTANO. Come, come, you are drunk.\n\nCASSIO. Drunk?\n\n(They fight.)\n\nIAGO (aside to Roderigo). Away I say, go out and cry a mutiny.\n\n(Exit Roderigo.)\n\nNay, good lieutenant: God’s will, gentlemen, [150]\n\nHelp, ho! – Lieutenant: – sir, – Montano, – sir, –\n\nHelp, masters, here’s a goodly watch indeed,\n\n(A bell rings.)\n\nWho’s that that rings the bell? – Diablo ... ho,\n\nThe town will rise, God’s will, lieutenant, hold,\n\nYou will be sham’d for ever. [155]\n\n(Enter Othello, and Gentlemen with weapons.)\n\nOTHELLO. What is the matter here?\n\nMONTANO.    Zounds, I bleed still,\n\nI am hurt, to the death.\n\nOTHELLO.    Hold, for your lives!\n\nIAGO.        Hold, hold,\n\nLieutenant, – sir, – Montano, – gentlemen, –\n\nHave you forgot all place of sense, and duty?\n\nHold, the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame! [160]\n\nOTHELLO. Why, how now, ho! from whence arises this?\n\nAre we turn’d Turks , and to ourselves do that\n\nWhich heaven has forbid the Ottomites?\n\nFor Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl ;\n\nHe that stirs next, to carve for his own rage, [165]\n\nHolds his soul light, he dies upon his motion;\n\nSilence that dreadful bell, it fright s the isle\n\nFrom her propriety : what’s the matter, masters?\n\nHonest Iago, that looks dead with grieving ,\n\nSpeak, who began this? on thy love I charge thee. [170]\n\nIAGO. I do not know, friends all but now, even now,\n\nIn quarter , and in terms , like bride and groom,\n\n Devest ing them to bed, and then but now,\n\nAs if some planet had unwit ted men,\n\nSwords out, and tilt ing one at other’s breast, [175]\n\nIn opposition bloody. I cannot speak\n\nAny beginning to this peevish odds;\n\nAnd would in action glorious I had lost\n\nThese legs, that brought me to a part of it!\n\nOTHELLO. How came it, Michael, you were thus forgot? [180]\n\nCASSIO. I pray you pardon me, I cannot speak.\n\nOTHELLO. Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil,\n\nThe gravity and stillness of your youth\n\nThe world hath noted, and your name is great\n\nIn mouths of wisest censure : what’s the matter, [185]\n\nThat you unlace your reputation thus,\n\nAnd spend your rich opinion, for the name\n\nOf a night-brawler ? Give me answer to ’t.\n\nMONTANO. Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger,\n\nYour officer Iago can inform you – [190]\n\nWhile I spare speech, which something now offends me –\n\nOf all that I do know; nor know I aught\n\nBy me that’s said or done amiss this night,\n\nUnless self-charity be sometime a vice,\n\nAnd to defend ourselves it be a sin [195]\n\nWhen violence assails us.\n\nOTHELLO.    Now by heaven\n\nMy blood begins my safer guides to rule,\n\nAnd passion having my best judgement collied\n\nAssays to lead the way. Zounds, if I stir,\n\nOr do but lift this arm, the best of you [200]\n\nShall sink in my rebuke : give me to know\n\nHow this foul rout began, who set it on,\n\nAnd he that is approv’d in this offence,\n\nThough he had twinn’d with me, both at a birth,\n\nShall lose me: what, in a town of war, [205]\n\nYet wild, the people’s hearts brim full of fear,\n\nTo manage private and domestic quarrels,\n\nIn night, and on the court and guard of safety?\n\n’Tis monstrous. Iago, who began?\n\nMONTANO. If partially affin’d , or leagu’d in office, [210]\n\nThou dost deliver more or less than truth,\n\nThou art no soldier.\n\nIAGO.    Touch me not so near,\n\nI had rather ha’ this tongue cut from my mouth,\n\nThan it should do offence to Michael Cassio:\n\nYet I persuade myself, to speak the truth [215]\n\nShall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general:\n\nMontano and myself being in speech,\n\nThere comes a fellow, crying out for help,\n\nAnd Cassio following him with determin’d sword,\n\nTo execute upon him: sir, this gentleman [220]\n\nSteps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause;\n\nMyself the crying fellow did pursue ,\n\n Lest by his clamour (as it so fell out)\n\nThe town might fall in fright : he, swift of foot,\n\nOutran my purpose: and I return’d the rather, [225]\n\nFor that I heard the clink and fall of swords;\n\nAnd Cassio high in oaths , which till to-night\n\nI ne’er might see before: when I came back\n\n(For this was brief ) I found them close together,\n\nAt blow and thrust , even as again they were, [230]\n\nWhen you yourself did part them.\n\nMore of this matter can I not report,\n\nBut men are men, the best sometimes forget;\n\nThough Cassio did some little wrong to him,\n\nAs men in rage strike those that wish them best, [235]\n\nYet surely Cassio, I believe, receiv’d,\n\nFrom him that fled, some strange indignity ,\n\nWhich patience could not pass.\n\nOTHELLO.    I know, Iago,\n\nThy honesty and love doth mince this matter,\n\nMaking it light to Cassio: Cassio, I love thee, [240]\n\nBut never more be officer of mine.\n\n(Enter Desdemona, with others.)\n\nLook if my gentle love be not rais’d up!\n\nI’ll make thee an example.\n\nDESDEMONA. What is the matter?\n\nOTHELLO. All’s well now, sweeting ; come away to bed: [245]\n\nSir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon ;\n\nLead him off.\n\n(Montano is led off.)\n\nIago, look with care about the town,\n\nAnd silence those whom this vile brawl distract ed .\n\nCome, Desdemona: ’tis the soldier’s life, [250]\n\nTo have their balmy  slumber s wak’d with strife .\n\n(Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio.)\n\nIAGO. What, are you hurt, lieutenant?\n\nCASSIO. Ay, past all surgery .\n\nIAGO. Marry, God forbid!\n\nCASSIO. Reputation, reputation, I ha’ lost my [255] reputation! I ha’ lost the immortal part, sir, of myself, and what remains is bestial; my reputation, Iago, my reputation!\n\nIAGO. As I am an honest man, I thought you had receiv’d some bodily wound, there is more offence [260] in that than in reputation: reputation is an idle and most false imposition , oft got without merit, and lost without deserving. You have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser; what man, there are ways to recover the general again: [265] you are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice, even so, as one would beat his offenceless dog, to affright an imperious lion: sue to him again, and he’s yours.\n\nCASSIO. I will rather sue to be despis’d, than to deceive [270] so good a commander, with so light , so drunken, and indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot ? and squabble ? swagger ? swear? and discourse  fustian with one’s own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us [275] call thee devil!\n\nIAGO. What was he, that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you?\n\nCASSIO. I know not.\n\nIAGO. Is ’t possible? [280]\n\nCASSIO. I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths, to steal away their brains; that we should with joy, revel, pleasure, and applause, transform ourselves into [285] beasts!\n\nIAGO. Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus recover ed ?\n\nCASSIO. It hath pleas’d the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath ; one unperfectness shows [290] me another, to make me frankly despise myself.\n\nIAGO. Come, you are too severe a moraler ; as the time, the place, the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not so befall en ; but since it is as it is, mend it, for your own good. [295]\n\nCASSIO.  I will ask him for my place again, he shall tell me I am a drunkard: had I as many mouths as Hydra , such an answer would stop ’em all: to be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! Every unordinate cup is unbless’d, and the [300]  ingredience is a devil.\n\nIAGO. Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well us’d; exclaim no more against it; and, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.\n\nCASSIO. I have well approv’d it, sir, ... I drunk! [305]\n\nIAGO. You, or any man living, may be drunk at some time: I’ll tell you what you shall do ... Our general’s wife is now the general; I may say so in this respect, for that he has devoted and given up himself to the contemplation , mark and denotement of her parts [310] and grace s . Confess yourself freely to her, importune her she’ll help to put you in your place again: she is so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition , that she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This brawl between [315] you and her husband, entreat her to splinter , and my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than ’twas before.\n\nCASSIO. You advise me well. [320]\n\nIAGO. I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.\n\nCASSIO. I think it freely, and betimes in the morning will I beseech the virtuous Desdemona, to undertake for me; I am desperate of my fortunes, if they [325] check me here.\n\nIAGO. You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I must to the watch.\n\nCASSIO. Good night, honest Iago.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nIAGO. And what’s he then, that says I play the villain,\n\nWhen this advice is free I give, and honest, [330]\n\n Probal to thinking , and indeed the course\n\nTo win the Moor again? For ’tis most easy\n\nThe inclining Desdemona to subdue,\n\nIn any honest suit; she’s fram’d as fruitful\n\nAs the free elements: and then for her [335]\n\n To win the Moor, were ’t to renounce his baptism ,\n\nAll seal s and symbols of redeemed sin,\n\nHis soul is so infetter’d to her love,\n\nThat she may make, unmake, do what she list,\n\nEven as her appetite shall play the god [340]\n\nWith his weak  function . How am I then a villain,\n\nTo counsel Cassio to this parallel course,\n\nDirectly to his good? Divinity of hell!\n\nWhen devils will their blackest sins put on,\n\nThey do suggest at first with heavenly shows, [345]\n\nAs I do now: for while this honest fool\n\n Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes,\n\nAnd she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,\n\nI’ll pour this pestilence into his ear,\n\nThat she repeals him for her body’s lust; [350]\n\nAnd by how much she strives to do him good,\n\nShe shall undo her credit with the Moor;\n\nSo will I turn her virtue into pitch ,\n\nAnd out of her own goodness make the net\n\nThat shall enmesh ’em all.\n\n(Enter Roderigo.)\n\nHow now, Roderigo? [355]\n\nRODERIGO. I do follow here in the chase , not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry: my money is almost spent, I ha’ been to-night exceedingly well cudgel’d : I think the issue will be, I shall have so much experience for my pain s , as that comes [360] to, and no money at all, and wit h that wit return to Venice.\n\nIAGO. How poor are they that ha’ not patience!\n\nWhat wound did ever heal, but by degrees?\n\nThou knowest we work by wit, and not by witchcraft, [365]\n\nAnd wit depends on dilatory time.\n\nDoes’t not go well? Cassio has beaten thee,\n\nAnd thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier ’d Cassio;\n\nThough other things grow fair against the sun,\n\nBut fruits that blossom first, will first be ripe; [370]\n\nContent thyself awhile; by the mass ’tis morning;\n\nPleasure, and action, make the hours seem short:\n\nRetire thee, go where thou art billeted ,\n\nAway I say, thou shalt know more hereafter:\n\nNay, get thee gone. (Exit Roderigo .) Some things are to be done, [375]\n\nMy wife must move for Cassio to her mistress,\n\nI’ll set her on.\n\nMyself awhile to draw the Moor apart,\n\nAnd bring him jump when he may Cassio find,\n\n Solicit ing his wife: ay, that’s the way, [380]\n\n Dull not device by coldness and delay.\n\n(Exit.)\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nAct III\n\nScene 1\n\nBefore the Castle.\n\nEnter Cassio, with Musicians and the Clown.\n\nCASSIO. Masters, play here, I will content your pains,\n\nSomething that’s brief, and bid “Good morrow, general.”\n\n(They play.)\n\nCLOWN. Why, masters, ha’ your instruments been at Naples , that they speak i’ the nose thus?\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN. How, sir, how? [5]\n\nCLOWN. Are these, I pray, call’d wind-instrument s ?\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN. Ay marry are they, sir.\n\nCLOWN. O, thereby hangs a tail.\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN. Whereby hangs a tale, sir?\n\nCLOWN. Marry, sir, by many a wind-instrument that I [10] know. But, masters, here’s money for you, and the general so likes your music, that he desires you, of all loves, to make no more noise with it.\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN. Well sir, we will not.\n\nCLOWN. If you have any music that may not be heard, [15] to ’t again, but, as they say, to hear music, the general does not greatly care.\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN. We ha’ none such, sir.\n\nCLOWN. Then put your pipes in your bag, for I’ll away; go, vanish away! [20]\n\n(Exeunt Musicians.)\n\nCASSIO. Dost thou hear my honest friend?\n\nCLOWN. No, I hear not your honest friend, I hear you.\n\nCASSIO. Prithee keep up thy quillets , there’s a poor piece of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends the general’s wife be stir ring , tell her there’s [25] one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech ... wilt thou do this?\n\nCLOWN. She is stirring, sir, if she will stir hither, I shall seem to notify unto her.\n\n(Enter Iago.)\n\nCASSIO. Do, good my friend.\n\n(Exit Clown.)\n\nIn happy time, Iago. [30]\n\nIAGO. You ha’ not been a-bed, then?\n\nCASSIO. Why no, the day had broke before we parted:\n\nI ha’ made bold , Iago,\n\nTo send in to your wife, ... my suit to her\n\nIs, that she will to virtuous Desdemona [35]\n\n Procure me some access .\n\nIAGO.    I’ll send her to you presently,\n\nAnd I’ll devise a mean to draw the Moor\n\nOut of the way, that your converse and business\n\nMay be more free.\n\nCASSIO. I humbly thank you for it. (Exit Iago.) I never knew [40]\n\nA Florentine more kind and honest.\n\n(Enter Emilia.)\n\nEMILIA. Good morrow, good lieutenant; I am sorry\n\nFor your displeasure, but all will soon be well,\n\nThe general and his wife are talking of it,\n\nAnd she speaks for you stoutly : the Moor replies, [45]\n\nThat he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,\n\nAnd great affinity , and that in wholesome wisdom\n\nHe might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you,\n\nAnd needs no other suitor but his likings\n\nTo take the safest occasion by the front, [50]\n\nTo bring you in again.\n\nCASSIO.    Yet I beseech you,\n\nIf you think fit , or that it may be done,\n\nGive me advantage of some brief discourse\n\nWith Desdemona alone.\n\nEMILIA.    Pray you, come in,\n\nI will bestow you where you shall have time [55]\n\nTo speak your bosom freely.\n\nCASSIO.    I am much bound to you.\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nScene 2\n\nThe same.\n\nEnter Othello, Iago, and other Gentlemen.\n\nOTHELLO. These letters give, Iago, to the pilot,\n\nAnd by him do my duties to the State:\n\nThat done, I will be walking on the works ,\n\n Repair there to me.\n\nIAGO.    Well, my good lord, I’ll do ’t.\n\nOTHELLO. This fortification , gentlemen, shall we see ’t? [5]\n\nGENTLEMEN . We wait upon your lordship.\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nScene 3\n\nThe same.\n\nEnter Desdemona, Cassio, and Emilia.\n\nDESDEMONA. Be thou assur’d , good Cassio, I will do\n\nAll my abilities in thy behalf .\n\nEMILIA. Good madam, do, I know it grieves my husband,\n\nAs if the case were his.\n\nDESDEMONA. O, that’s an honest fellow: ... do not doubt, Cassio, [5]\n\nBut I will have my lord and you again\n\nAs friendly as you were.\n\nCASSIO.    Bounteous madame,\n\nWhatever shall become of Michael Cassio,\n\nHe’s never anything but your true servant.\n\nDESDEMONA. O sir, I thank you; you do love my lord, [10]\n\nYou have known him long, and be you well assur’d,\n\nHe shall in strangest stand no farther off\n\nThan in a politic distance.\n\nCASSIO.    Ay, but, lady,\n\nThe policy may either last so long,\n\nOr feed upon such nice and wat’rish diet, [15]\n\nOr breed itself so out of circumstance,\n\nThat I being absent, and my place supplied,\n\nMy general will forget my love and service.\n\nDESDEMONA. Do not doubt that: before Emilia here\n\nI give thee warrant  of thy place; assure thee [20]\n\nIf I do vow a friendship, I’ll perform it\n\nTo the last article; my lord shall never rest,\n\nI’ll watch him tame , and talk him out of patience;\n\nHis bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift ,\n\nI’ll intermingle every thing he does [25]\n\nWith Cassio’s suit; therefore be merry, Cassio,\n\nFor thy solicitor shall rather die\n\nThan give thy cause away.\n\n(Enter Othello and Iago.)\n\nEMILIA. Madam, here comes my lord.\n\nCASSIO. Madam, I’ll take my leave. [30]\n\nDESDEMONA. Why, stay and hear me speak.\n\nCASSIO. Madam, not now, I am very ill at ease ,\n\nUnfit for mine own purpose.\n\nDESDEMONA. Well, do your discretion .\n\n(Exit Cassio.)\n\nIAGO. Ha, I like not that. [35]\n\nOTHELLO. What dost thou say?\n\nIAGO. Nothing, my lord, or if – I know not what.\n\nOTHELLO. Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?\n\nIAGO. Cassio, my lord? ... no, sure, I cannot think it,\n\nThat he would sneak away so guilty-like, [40]\n\nSeeing you coming.\n\nOTHELLO.    I do believe ’twas he.\n\nDESDEMONA. How now, my lord?\n\nI have been talking with a suitor here,\n\nA man that languish es in your displeasure.\n\nOTHELLO. Who is’t you mean? [45]\n\nDESDEMONA. Why, your lieutenant, Cassio, good my lord,\n\nIf I have any grace or power to move you,\n\nHis present reconciliation take:\n\nFor if he be not one that truly loves you,\n\nThat errs in ignorance, and not in cunning , [50]\n\nI have no judgement in an honest face,\n\nI prithee call him back.\n\nOTHELLO.    Went he hence now?\n\nDESDEMONA. Yes, faith, so humbled,\n\nThat he has left part of his griefs with me,\n\nI suffer with him; good love, call him back. [55]\n\nOTHELLO. Not now, sweet Desdemona, some other time.\n\nDESDEMONA. But shall ’t be shortly?\n\nOTHELLO.    The sooner, sweet, for you.\n\nDESDEMONA. Shall ’t be to-night at supper?\n\nOTHELLO.    No, not to-night.\n\nDESDEMONA. To-morrow dinner then?\n\nOTHELLO.    I shall not dine at home,\n\nI meet the captains, at the citadel. [60]\n\nDESDEMONA. Why then to-morrow night, or Tuesday morn,\n\nOn Tuesday noon, or night, or Wednesday morn:\n\nI prithee name the time, but let it not\n\nExceed three days: i’ faith, he’s penitent ,\n\nAnd yet his trespass , in our common reason, [65]\n\n(Save that, they say, the wars must make examples\n\nOut of their best) is not almost a fault\n\nTo incur a private check: when shall he come?\n\nTell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,\n\nWhat you could ask me, that I should deny ? [70]\n\nOr stand so mammer ing on? What? Michael Cassio,\n\nThat came a-wooing with you, and so many a time\n\nWhen I have spoke of you dispraisingly ,\n\nHath ta’en your part, to have so much to do\n\nTo bring him in? Byrlady , I could do much – [75]\n\nOTHELLO. Prithee no more, let him come when he will,\n\nI will deny thee nothing.\n\nDESDEMONA.    Why, this is not a boon ,\n\n’Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves;\n\nOr feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,\n\nOr sue to you, to do a peculiar profit [80]\n\nTo your own person: nay, when I have a suit\n\nWherein I mean to touch your love indeed,\n\nIt shall be full of poise and difficulty,\n\nAnd fearful to be granted.\n\nOTHELLO.    I will deny thee nothing,\n\nWhereon I do beseech thee grant me this, [85]\n\nTo leave me but a little to myself.\n\nDESDEMONA. Shall I deny you? no, farewell, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO. Farewell, my Desdemona, I’ll come to thee straight.\n\nDESDEMONA. Emilia, come; be it as your fancies teach you,\n\nWhate’er you be, I am obedient . [90]\n\n(Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.)\n\nOTHELLO. Excellent wretch , perdition catch my soul,\n\nBut I do love thee, and when I love thee not,\n\nChaos is come again.\n\nIAGO. My noble lord, –\n\nOTHELLO.    What dost thou say, Iago?\n\nIAGO. Did Michael Cassio, when you woo’d my lady, [95]\n\nKnow of your love?\n\nOTHELLO. He did, from first to last: ... why dost thou ask?\n\nIAGO. But for a satisfaction of my thought.\n\nNo further harm.\n\nOTHELLO.    Why of thy thought, Iago?\n\nIAGO. I did not think he had been acquainted with her. [100]\n\nOTHELLO. O yes, and went between us very often.\n\nIAGO. Indeed?\n\nOTHELLO. Indeed? Indeed: discern’st thou aught in that?\n\nIs he not honest?\n\nIAGO. Honest, my lord? [105]\n\nOTHELLO. Honest? ay, honest.\n\nIAGO. My lord, for aught I know.\n\nOTHELLO. What dost thou think?\n\nIAGO. Think, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO. Think, my lord? By heaven, he echoes me, [110]\n\nAs if there were some monster in his thought,\n\nToo hideous to be shown: thou didst mean something;\n\nI heard thee say but now, thou lik’st not that,\n\nWhen Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?\n\nAnd when I told thee he was of my counsel, [115]\n\nIn my whole course of wooing, thou criedst “Indeed?”\n\nAnd didst contract and purse thy brow together,\n\nAs if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain\n\nSome horrible conceit : if thou dost love me,\n\nShow me thy thought. [120]\n\nIAGO. My lord, you know I love you.\n\nOTHELLO.    I think thou dost,\n\nAnd for I know thou art full of love and honesty\n\nAnd weighest thy words, before thou give ’em breath,\n\nTherefore these stop s of thine fright me the more:\n\nFor such things in a false disloyal knave [125]\n\nAre tricks of custom; but in a man that’s just,\n\nThey are close denotement s , working from the heart,\n\nThat passion cannot rule.\n\nIAGO.    For Michael Cassio,\n\nI dare presume , I think that he is honest.\n\nOTHELLO. I think so too.\n\nIAGO.    Men should be that they seem, [130]\n\nOr those that be not, would they might seem none!\n\nOTHELLO. Certain, men should be what they seem.\n\nIAGO. Why then I think Cassio’s an honest man.\n\nOTHELLO. Nay, yet there’s more in this:\n\nI prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings, [135]\n\nAs thou dost ruminate , and give the worst of thought\n\nThe worst of word.\n\nIAGO.    Good my lord, pardon me;\n\nThough I am bound to every act of duty,\n\nI am not bound to that all slaves are free to;\n\n Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false: [140]\n\nAs where’s that palace, whereinto foul things\n\nSometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,\n\nBut some uncleanly apprehension s\n\nKeep leets and law-days , and in session sit\n\nWith meditation s lawful? [145]\n\nOTHELLO. Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,\n\nIf thou but thinkest him wrong’d, and makest his ear\n\nA stranger to thy thoughts.\n\nIAGO.    I do beseech you,\n\nThough I perchance am vicious in my guess,\n\n(As I confess it is my nature’s plague [150]\n\nTo spy into abuse s , and oft my jealousy\n\nShapes faults that are not) I entreat you then,\n\nFrom one that so imperfectly conject s ,\n\nYou’ld take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble\n\nOut of my scattering and unsure observance ; [155]\n\nIt were not for your quiet, nor your good,\n\nNor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,\n\nTo let you know my thoughts.\n\nOTHELLO.    Zounds!\n\nIAGO. Good name in man and woman ’s dear, my lord;\n\nIs the immediate jewel of our souls: [160]\n\nWho steals my purse, steals trash, ’tis something, nothing,\n\n’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands:\n\nBut he that filch es from me my good name\n\nRobs me of that which not enrich es him,\n\nAnd makes me poor indeed. [165]\n\nOTHELLO. By heaven I’ll know thy thought.\n\nIAGO. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,\n\nNor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody :\n\nO, beware jealousy;\n\nIt is the green-ey’d monster, which doth mock  [170]\n\nThat meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss ,\n\nWho, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger:\n\nBut O, what damned minutes tells he o’er\n\nWho dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!\n\nOTHELLO. O misery! [175]\n\nIAGO. Poor and content is rich, and rich enough,\n\nBut riches, fineless , is as poor as winter\n\nTo him that ever fears he shall be poor:\n\nGood God, the souls of all my tribe defend\n\nFrom jealousy!\n\nOTHELLO.    Why, why is this? [180]\n\nThink’st thou l’ld make a life of jealousy?\n\nTo follow still the changes of the moon\n\nWith fresh suspicions? No, to be once in doubt,\n\nIs once to be resolv’d: exchange me for a goat ,\n\nWhen I shall turn the business of my soul [185]\n\nTo such exsufflicate and blown surmise s ,\n\nMatching thy inference : ’tis not to make me jealous,\n\nTo say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,\n\nIs free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;\n\nWhere virtue is, these are more virtuous: [190]\n\nNor from mine own weak merits will I draw\n\nThe smallest fear, or doubt of her revolt,\n\nFor she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,\n\nI’ll see before I doubt, when I doubt, prove,\n\nAnd on the proof, there is no more but this: [195]\n\nAway at once with love or jealousy!\n\nIAGO. I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason\n\nTo show the love and duty that I bear you\n\nWith franker spirit: therefore as I am bound\n\nReceive it from me: I speak not yet of proof; [200]\n\nLook to your wife, observe her well with Cassio;\n\nWear your eye thus, not jealous, nor secure.\n\nI would not have your free and noble nature\n\nOut of self-bounty be abused, look to ’t:\n\nI know our country disposition well; [205]\n\nIn Venice they do let God see the pranks\n\nThey dare not show their husbands: their best conscience\n\nIs not to leave undone, but keep unknown.\n\nOTHELLO. Dost thou say so?\n\nIAGO. She did deceive her father, marrying you; [210]\n\nAnd when she seem’d to shake and fear your looks,\n\nShe lov’d them most.\n\nOTHELLO.    And so she did.\n\nIAGO.        Why, go to then,\n\nShe that so young could give out such a seeming,\n\nTo seal her father’s eyes up, close as oak,\n\nHe thought ’twas witchcraft: but I am much to blame, [215]\n\nI humbly do beseech you of your pardon,\n\nFor too much loving you.\n\nOTHELLO.    I am bound to thee for ever.\n\nIAGO. I see this hath a little dash ’d your spirits.\n\nOTHELLO. Not a jot, not a jot.\n\nIAGO.    I’ faith I fear it has.\n\nI hope you will consider what is spoke [220]\n\nComes from my love: but I do see you are mov’d,\n\nI am to pray you, not to strain my speech\n\nTo grosser issues, nor to larger reach,\n\nThan to suspicion.\n\nOTHELLO. I will not.\n\nIAGO.    Should you do so, my lord, [225]\n\nMy speech should fall into such vile success\n\nAs my thoughts aim not at: Cassio’s my trusty friend:\n\nMy lord, I see you are mov’d.\n\nOTHELLO.    No, not much mov’d,\n\nI do not think but Desdemona’s honest.\n\nIAGO. Long live she so, and long live you to think so! [230]\n\nOTHELLO. And yet how nature erring from itself –\n\nIAGO. Ay, there’s the point: as, to be bold with you,\n\nNot to affect many proposed match es ,\n\nOf her own clime , complexion , and degree,\n\nWhereto we see in all things nature tends; [235]\n\nFie, we may smell in such a will most rank ,\n\nFoul disproportion; thoughts unnatural.\n\nBut pardon me: I do not in position\n\nDistinctly speak of her, though I may fear\n\nHer will, recoil ing to her better judgement, [240]\n\nMay fall to match you with her country form s ,\n\nAnd happily  repent .\n\nOTHELLO.    Farewell, if more\n\nThou dost perceive, let me know more, set on\n\nThy wife to observe; leave me, Iago.\n\nIAGO (going). My lord, I take my leave. [245]\n\nOTHELLO. Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless\n\nSees and knows more, much more, than he unfold s .\n\nIAGO (returning). My lord, I would I might entreat your honour\n\nTo scan this thing no further, leave it to time:\n\nThough it be fit that Cassio have his place, [250]\n\nFor sure he fills it up with great ability,\n\nYet if you please to hold him off awhile,\n\nYou shall by that perceive him and his means;\n\nNote if your lady strain her entertainment\n\nWith any strong or vehement importunity , [255]\n\nMuch will be seen in that; in the mean time,\n\nLet me be thought too busy in my fears\n\n(As worthy cause I have to fear I am);\n\nAnd hold her free, I do beseech your honour.\n\nOTHELLO. Fear not my government. [260]\n\nIAGO. I once more take my leave.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nOTHELLO. This fellow’s of exceeding honesty,\n\nAnd knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,\n\nOf human dealing: if I do prove her haggard ,\n\nThough that her jesses were my dear heart-strings , [265]\n\nI’ld whistle her off, and let her down the wind,\n\nTo prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black,\n\nAnd have not those soft parts of conversation\n\nThat chamberer s have, or for I am declin’d\n\nInto the vale of years, – yet that’s not much – [270]\n\nShe’s gone, I am abus’d, and my relief\n\nMust be to loathe her: O curse of marriage,\n\nThat we can call these delicate creatures ours,\n\nAnd not their appetites! I had rather be a toad ,\n\nAnd live upon the vapour in a dungeon , [275]\n\nThan keep a corner in a thing I love,\n\nFor others’ uses: yet ’tis the plague of great ones,\n\n Prerogativ’d are they less than the base,\n\n’Tis destiny, unshunnable , like death:\n\nEven then this forked plague is fated to us, [280]\n\nWhen we do quicken : Desdemona comes,\n\nIf she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself,\n\nI’ll not believe it.\n\n(Enter Desdemona and Emilia.)\n\nDESDEMONA.    How now, my dear Othello?\n\nYour dinner, and the generous islanders\n\nBy you invited, do attend your presence. [285]\n\nOTHELLO. I am to blame.\n\nDESDEMONA. Why is your speech so faint? are you not well?\n\nOTHELLO. I have a pain upon my forehead, here.\n\nDESDEMONA. Faith, that’s with watching, ’twill away again;\n\nLet me but bind your head, within this hour [290]\n\nIt will be well again.\n\nOTHELLO.    Your napkin is too little:\n\n(She drops her handkerchief.)\n\nLet it alone, come, I’ll go in with you.\n\nDESDEMONA.  I am very sorry that you are not well.\n\n(Exeunt Othello and Desdemona.)\n\nEMILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;\n\nThis was her first remembrance from the Moor, [295]\n\nMy wayward husband hath a hundred times\n\nWoo’d me to steal it, but she so loves the token ,\n\nFor he conjur’d her she should ever keep it,\n\nThat she reserves it evermore about her,\n\nTo kiss, and talk to; I’ll ha’ the work ta’en out, [300]\n\nAnd give’t Iago: what he’ll do with it\n\nHeaven knows, not I,\n\nI nothing know, but for his fantasy.\n\n(Enter Iago . )\n\nIAGO. How now, what do you here alone?\n\nEMILIA. Do not you chide, I have a thing for you. [305]\n\nIAGO. A thing for me? it is a common thing –\n\nEMILIA. Ha?\n\nIAGO. To have a foolish wife.\n\nEMILIA. O, is that all? What will you give me now,\n\nFor that same handkerchief?\n\nIAGO.    What handkerchief? [310]\n\nEMILIA. What handkerchief?\n\nWhy, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,\n\nThat which so often you did bid me steal.\n\nIAGO. Hast stole it from her?\n\nEMILIA. No, faith, she let it drop by negligence, [315]\n\nAnd, to the advantage, I being here took ’t up:\n\nLook, here it is.\n\nIAGO.    A good wench , give it me.\n\nEMILIA. What will you do with it, that you have been\n\nSo earnest to have me filch it?\n\nIAGO (snatching it). Why, what’s that to you? [320]\n\nEMILIA. If it be not for some purpose of import ,\n\nGive me ’t again, poor lady, she’ll run mad,\n\nWhen she shall lack it.\n\nIAGO. Be not you known on ’t, I have use for it: ...\n\nGo, leave me: [325]\n\n(Exit Emilia.)\n\nI will in Cassio’s lodging lose this napkin,\n\nAnd let him find it: trifle s light as air\n\nAre to the jealous, confirmation s strong\n\nAs proofs of holy writ ; this may do something.\n\nThe Moor already changes with my poison: [330]\n\nDangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,\n\nWhich at the first are scarce found to distaste ,\n\nBut with a little act upon the blood\n\nBurn like the mines of sulphur : I did say so:\n\n(Enter Othello.)\n\nLook where he comes, not poppy , nor mandragora , [335]\n\nNor all the drowsy syrups of the world,\n\nShall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep\n\nWhich thou owedst yesterday.\n\nOTHELLO. Ha, ha, false to me, to me?\n\nIAGO. Why, how now, general? no more of that. [340]\n\nOTHELLO. Avaunt , be gone, thou hast set me on the rack ,\n\nI swear, ’tis better to be much abus’d\n\nThan but to know’t a little.\n\nIAGO.    How now, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO. What sense had I of her stol’n hours of lust?\n\nI saw’t not, thought it not, it harm’d not me, [345]\n\nI slept the next night well, was free and merry;\n\nI found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips;\n\nHe that is robb’d, not wanting what is stol’n,\n\nLet him not know’t, and he’s not robb’d at all.\n\nIAGO. I am sorry to hear this. [350]\n\nOTHELLO. I had been happy if the general camp,\n\n Pioner s , and all, had tasted her sweet body,\n\nSo I had nothing known: O now for ever\n\nFarewell the tranquil mind, farewell content:\n\nFarewell the plumed troop, and the big wars, [355]\n\nThat makes ambition virtue: O farewell,\n\nFarewell the neighing steed , and the shrill trump ,\n\nThe spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife ;\n\nThe royal banner, and all quality,\n\nPride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war! [360]\n\nAnd, O ye mortal  engine s , whose wide throat s\n\nThe immortal Jove’s great clamour counterfeit ;\n\nFarewell, Othello’s occupation’s gone!\n\nIAGO. Is ’t possible, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO. Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore , [365]\n\nBe sure of it, give me the ocular proof,\n\nOr by the worth of man’s eternal soul,\n\nThou hadst been better have been born a dog,\n\nThan answer my wak’d wrath.\n\nIAGO.    Is ’t come to this?\n\nOTHELLO. Make me to see ’t, or at the least so prove it, [370]\n\nThat the probation bear no hinge , nor loop ,\n\nTo hang a doubt on: or woe upon thy life!\n\nIAGO. My noble lord, –\n\nOTHELLO. If thou dost slander her, and torture me,\n\nNever pray more, abandon all remorse . [375]\n\nOn horror’s head horrors accumulate :\n\nDo deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amaz’d ,\n\nFor nothing canst thou to damnation add\n\nGreater than that.\n\nIAGO.    O grace, O heaven defend me!\n\nAre you a man, have you a soul or sense? [380]\n\nGod buy you, take mine office, – O wretched fool,\n\nThat livest to make thine honesty a vice!\n\nO monstrous world, take note, take note, O world,\n\nTo be direct and honest, is not safe,\n\nI thank you for this profit, and from hence [385]\n\nI’ll love no friend, since love breeds such offence.\n\nOTHELLO. Nay, stay, thou shouldst be honest.\n\nIAGO. I should be wise, for honesty’s a fool,\n\nAnd loses that it works for.\n\nOTHELLO.    By the world,\n\nI think my wife be honest, and think she is not, [390]\n\nI think that thou art just, and think thou art not;\n\nI’ll have some proof: my name, that was as fresh\n\nAs Dian ’s visage, is now begrim’d , and black\n\nAs mine own face: if there be cord s , or knives,\n\nPoison, or fire, or suffocating streams, [395]\n\nI’ll not endure it: would I were satisfied!\n\nIAGO. I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion,\n\nI do repent me that I put it to you;\n\nYou would be satisfied.\n\nOTHELLO.    Would, nay, I will.\n\nIAGO. And may, but, how, how satisfied, my lord? [400]\n\nWould you, the supervisor , grossly gape on,\n\nBehold her topp’d?\n\nOTHELLO.    Death and damnation ... O!\n\nIAGO. It were a tedious difficulty, I think,\n\nTo bring ’em to that prospect , damn ’em then,\n\nIf ever mortal eyes did see them bolster  [405]\n\nMore than their own; what then, how then?\n\nWhat shall I say? where’s satisfaction?\n\nIt is impossible you should see this,\n\nWere they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,\n\nAs salt as wolves, in pride; and fools as gross [410]\n\nAs ignorance made drunk: but yet I say,\n\nIf imputation and strong circumstances,\n\nWhich lead directly to the door of truth,\n\nWill give you satisfaction, you may ha’t.\n\nOTHELLO. Give me a living reason, that she’s disloyal. [415]\n\nIAGO. I do not like the office,\n\nBut sith I am enter’d into this cause so far,\n\nPrick’d to ’t by foolish honesty and love,\n\nI will go on: I lay with Cassio lately,\n\nAnd being troubled with a raging tooth , [420]\n\nI could not sleep.\n\nThere are a kind of men so loose of soul,\n\nThat in their sleeps will mutter their affairs,\n\nOne of this kind is Cassio:\n\nIn sleep I heard him say “Sweet Desdemona, [425]\n\nLet us be wary , let us hide our loves;”\n\nAnd then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand ,\n\nCry out, “Sweet creature!” and then kiss me hard,\n\nAs if he pluck’d up kisses by the roots,\n\nThat grew upon my lips, then laid his leg [430]\n\nOver my thigh , and sigh’d, and kiss’d, and then\n\nCried “Cursed fate, that gave thee to the Moor!”\n\nOTHELLO. O monstrous, monstrous!\n\nIAGO.    Nay, this was but his dream.\n\nOTHELLO. But this denote d a foregone conclusion.\n\nIAGO. ’Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream, [435]\n\nAnd this may help to thicken other proofs,\n\nThat do demonstrate thinly.\n\nOTHELLO. I’ll tear her all to pieces.\n\nIAGO. Nay, but be wise, yet we see nothing done,\n\nShe may be honest yet; tell me but this, [440]\n\nHave you not sometimes seen a handkerchief,\n\nSpotted with strawberries , in your wife’s hand?\n\nOTHELLO. I gave her such a one, ’twas my first gift.\n\nIAGO. I know not that, but such a handkerchief –\n\nI am sure it was your wife’s – did I to-day [445]\n\nSee Cassio wipe his beard with.\n\nOTHELLO.    If’t be that, –\n\nIAGO. If it be that, or any that was hers,\n\nIt speaks against her, with the other proofs.\n\nOTHELLO. O that the slave had forty thousand lives!\n\nOne is too poor, too weak for my revenge: [450]\n\nNow do I see ’tis true; look here, Iago,\n\nAll my fond love thus do I blow to heaven, ...\n\n’Tis gone.\n\nArise, black vengeance , from thy hollow cell,\n\n Yield up , O love, thy crown, and hearted throne, [455]\n\nTo tyrannous hate, swell, bosom, with thy fraught ,\n\nFor ’tis of aspic s’ tongues!\n\n(He kneels.)\n\nIAGO. Pray be content.\n\nOTHELLO.    O, blood, Iago, blood!\n\nIAGO. Patience I say, your mind perhaps may change.\n\nOTHELLO. Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic sea , [460]\n\nWhose icy current, and compulsive course,\n\nNe’er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on\n\nTo the Propontic , and the Hellespont :\n\nEven so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace\n\nShall ne’er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love, [465]\n\nTill that a capable and wide revenge\n\nSwallow them up. Now by yond  marble heaven,\n\nIn the due reverence of a sacred vow,\n\nI here engage my words.\n\nIAGO.    Do not rise yet.\n\n(Iago kneels.)\n\nWitness, you ever-burning lights above, [470]\n\nYou elements that clip us round about,\n\nWitness that here Iago doth give up\n\nThe excellency of his wit, hand, heart,\n\nTo wrong’d Othello’s service: let him command,\n\nAnd to obey shall be in me remorse, [475]\n\nWhat bloody work so ever.\n\n(They rise.)\n\nOTHELLO.    I greet thy love;\n\nNot with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,\n\nAnd will upon the instant put thee to ’t,\n\nWithin these three days, let me hear thee say\n\nThat Cassio’s not alive.\n\nIAGO.    My friend is dead: [480]\n\n’Tis done as you request, but let her live.\n\nOTHELLO. Damn her, lewd  minx : O, damn her!\n\nCome, go with me apart, I will withdraw\n\nTo furnish me with some swift means of death,\n\nFor the fair devil: now art thou my lieutenant. [485]\n\nIAGO. I am your own for ever.\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nScene 4\n\nThe same.\n\nEnter Desdemona, Emilia, and the Clown.\n\nDESDEMONA. Do you know, sirrah , where the Lieutenant Cassio lies?\n\nCLOWN. I dare not say he lies any where.\n\nDESDEMONA. Why, man?\n\nCLOWN. He is a soldier, and for one to say a soldier [5]  lies , is stab bing .\n\nDESDEMONA. Go to, where lodge s he?\n\nCLOWN. To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.\n\nDESDEMONA. Can any thing be made of this? [10]\n\nCLOWN. I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging, and say he lies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.\n\nDESDEMONA. Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report? [15]\n\nCLOWN. I will catechize the world for him, that is, make questions and by them answer.\n\nDESDEMONA. Seek him, bid him come hither, tell him I have moved my lord in his behalf, and hope all will be well. [20]\n\nCLOWN. To do this is within the compass of a man, and therefore I’ll attempt the doing of it.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nDESDEMONA. Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?\n\nEMILIA. I know not, madam.\n\nDESDEMONA. Believe me, I had rather lose my purse [25]\n\nFull of crusado es : and but my noble Moor\n\nIs true of mind, and made of no such baseness\n\nAs jealous creatures are, it were enough\n\nTo put him to ill thinking.\n\nEMILIA.    Is he not jealous?\n\nDESDEMONA. Who, he? I think the sun where he was born [30]\n\nDrew all such humours from him.\n\n(Enter Othello.)\n\nEMILIA.    Look, where he comes.\n\nDESDEMONA. I will not leave him now; let Cassio\n\nBe call’d to him. How is it with you, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO. Well, my good lady: (Aside.) O, hardness to dissemble !\n\nHow do you do, Desdemona?\n\nDESDEMONA.    Well, my good lord. [35]\n\nOTHELLO. Give me your hand; this hand is moist , my lady.\n\nDESDEMONA. It yet has felt no age, nor known no sorrow.\n\nOTHELLO. This argues fruitfulness, and liberal heart;\n\nHot, hot, and moist, this hand of yours requires\n\nA sequester from liberty; fasting and praying, [40]\n\nMuch castigation , exercise devout ;\n\nFor here’s a young and sweating devil here,\n\nThat commonly rebels: ’tis a good hand,\n\nA frank one.\n\nDESDEMONA. You may indeed say so,\n\nFor ’twas that hand that gave away my heart. [45]\n\nOTHELLO. A liberal hand; the hearts of old gave hands,\n\nBut our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.\n\nDESDEMONA. I cannot speak of this; come, come, your promise.\n\nOTHELLO. What promise, chuck ?\n\nDESDEMONA. I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you. [50]\n\nOTHELLO. I have a salt and sullen  rheum offends me,\n\nLend me thy handkerchief.\n\nDESDEMONA. Here, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO. That which I gave you.\n\nDESDEMONA. I have it not about me. [55]\n\nOTHELLO. Not?\n\nDESDEMONA. No, faith, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO.    That’s a fault: that handkerchief\n\nDid an Egyptian to my mother give,\n\nShe was a charmer , and could almost read\n\nThe thoughts of people; she told her, while she kept it [60]\n\n’Twould make her amiable , and subdue my father\n\nEntirely to her love: but if she lost it,\n\nOr made a gift of it, my father’s eye\n\nShould hold her loathly , and his spirits should hunt\n\nAfter new fancies: she dying, gave it me, [65]\n\nAnd bid me, when my fate would have me wive,\n\nTo give it her; I did so, and take heed on ’t,\n\nMake it a darling, like your precious eye,\n\nTo lose, or give ’t away, were such perdition\n\nAs nothing else could match.\n\nDESDEMONA.    Is ’t possible? [70]\n\nOTHELLO. ’Tis true, there’s magic in the web of it;\n\nA sibyl , that had number’d in the world\n\nThe sun to make two hundred compasses,\n\nIn her prophetic fury sew’d the work;\n\nThe worms were hallow’d that did breed the silk , [75]\n\nAnd it was dye d in mummy , which the skilful\n\nConserve of maidens’ hearts.\n\nDESDEMONA.    I’ faith, is ’t true?\n\nOTHELLO. Most veritable , therefore look to ’t well.\n\nDESDEMONA. Then would to God that I had never seen it!\n\nOTHELLO. Ha, wherefore? [80]\n\nDESDEMONA. Why do you speak so startingly  an d rash?\n\nOTHELLO. Is ’t lost? is ’t gone? speak, is it out o’ the way?\n\nDESDEMONA. Heaven bless us!\n\nOTHELLO. Say you?\n\nDESDEMONA. It is not lost, but what an if it were? [85]\n\nOTHELLO. Ha!\n\nDESDEMONA. I say it is not lost.\n\nOTHELLO.    Fetch ’t, let me see it.\n\nDESDEMONA. Why, so I can sir, but I will not now,\n\nThis is a trick, to put me from my suit,\n\nI pray let Cassio be receiv’d again. [90]\n\nOTHELLO. Fetch me that handkerchief, my mind misgive s .\n\nDESDEMONA. Come, come,\n\nYou’ll never meet a more sufficient man.\n\nOTHELLO. The handkerchief!\n\nDESDEMONA.    I pray, talk me of Cassio.\n\nOTHELLO. The handkerchief!\n\nDESDEMONA.    A man that all his time [95]\n\nHath founded his good fortunes on your love,\n\nShar’d dangers with you, –\n\nOTHELLO. The handkerchief!\n\nDESDEMONA.    I’ faith, you are to blame.\n\nOTHELLO. Zounds!\n\n(Exit.)\n\nEMILIA. Is not this man jealous? [100]\n\nDESDEMONA. I ne’er saw this before:\n\nSure there’s some wonder in this handkerchief,\n\nI am most unhappy in the loss of it.\n\nEMILIA. ’Tis not a year or two shows us a man:\n\nThey are all but stomachs, and we all but food; [105]\n\nThey eat us hungerly, and when they are full,\n\nThey belch us.\n\n(Enter Iago and Cassio.)\n\nLook you, Cassio and my husband.\n\nIAGO. There is no other way, ’tis she must do it,\n\nAnd lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.\n\nDESDEMONA. How now, good Cassio, what’s the news with you? [110]\n\nCASSIO. Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you,\n\nThat by your virtuous means I may again\n\nExist, and be a member of his love,\n\nWhom I, with all the duty of my heart,\n\nEntirely honour; I would not be delay’d: [115]\n\nIf my offence be of such mortal kind,\n\nThat neither service past, nor present sorrows,\n\nNor purpos’d merit in futurity ,\n\nCan ransom me into his love again,\n\nBut to know so must be my benefit; [120]\n\nSo shall I clothe me in a forc’d content,\n\nAnd shut myself up in some other course\n\nTo fortune’s alms .\n\nDESDEMONA.    Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio,\n\nMy advocation is not now in tune ;\n\nMy lord is not my lord, nor should I know him, [125]\n\nWere he in favour as in humour alter’d.\n\nSo help me every spirit sanctified ,\n\nAs I have spoken for you, all my best,\n\nAnd stood within the blank of his displeasure\n\nFor my free speech: you must awhile be patient; [130]\n\nWhat I can do I will, and more I will\n\nThan for myself I dare, let that suffice you.\n\nIAGO. Is my lord angry?\n\nEMILIA.    He went hence but now,\n\nAnd certainly in strange unquietness.\n\nIAGO. Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon , [135]\n\nWhen it hath blown his rank s into the air;\n\nAnd (like the devil) from his very arm\n\n Puff ’d his own brother, and can he be angry?\n\nSomething of moment then: I will go meet him,\n\nThere’s matter in ’t indeed, if he be angry. [140]\n\n(Exit.)\n\nDESDEMONA. I prithee do so: something sure of state,\n\nEither from Venice, or some unhatch’d  practice ,\n\nMade demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,\n\nHath puddle d his clear spirit, and in such cases\n\nMen’s natures wrangle with inferior things, [145]\n\nThough great ones are the object.\n\n’Tis even so; for let our finger ache ,\n\nAnd it indues our other healthful members\n\nEven to that sense of pain; nay, we must think\n\nMen are not gods; [150]\n\nNor of them look for such observance s\n\nAs fits the bridal : beshrew me much, Emilia,\n\nI was ( unhandsome warrior as I am)\n\n Arraign ing his unkindness with my soul;\n\nBut now I find I had suborn ’d the witness, [155]\n\nAnd he’s indicted falsely.\n\nEMILIA. Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,\n\nAnd no conception , nor no jealous toy\n\nConcerning you.\n\nDESDEMONA. Alas the day, I never gave him cause! [160]\n\nEMILIA. But jealous souls will not be answer’d so;\n\nThey are not ever jealous for the cause,\n\nBut jealous for they are jealous: ’tis a monster,\n\n Begot upon itself, born on itself.\n\nDESDEMONA. Heaven keep that monster from Othello’s mind! [165]\n\nEMILIA. Lady, amen.\n\nDESDEMONA. I will go seek him, Cassio, walk hereabout,\n\nIf I do find him fit, I’ll move your suit,\n\nAnd seek to effect it to my uttermost.\n\nCASSIO. I humbly thank your ladyship. [170]\n\n(Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.)\n\n(Enter Bianca.)\n\nBIANCA. Save you, friend Cassio!\n\nCASSIO.    What make you from home?\n\nHow is it with you, my most fair Bianca?\n\nI’ faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.\n\nBIANCA. And I was going to your lodging, Cassio;\n\nWhat, keep a week away? seven days and nights? [175]\n\nEight score eight hours, and lovers’ absent hours,\n\nMore tedious than the dial , eight score times?\n\nO weary reckoning !\n\nCASSIO.    Pardon me, Bianca,\n\nI have this while with leaden thoughts been press’d,\n\nBut I shall in a more convenient time [180]\n\nStrike off this score of absence: sweet Bianca,\n\n(Giving her Desdemona’s handkerchief.)\n\nTake me this work out.\n\nBIANCA.    O Cassio, whence came this?\n\nThis is some token from a newer friend;\n\nTo the felt absence, now I feel a cause,\n\nIs ’t come to this?\n\nCASSIO.    Go to, woman, [185]\n\nThrow your vile guesses in the devil’s teeth,\n\nFrom whence you have them; you are jealous now\n\nThat this is from some mistress, some remembrance.\n\nNo, by my faith, Bianca.\n\nBIANCA.    Why, whose is it?\n\nCASSIO. I know not, sweet, I found it in my chamber; [190]\n\nI like the work well; ere it be demanded,\n\nAs like enough it will, I’ld have it copied;\n\nTake it, and do ’t, and leave me for this time.\n\nBIANCA. Leave you, wherefore?\n\nCASSIO. I do attend here on the general, [195]\n\nAnd think it no addition , nor my wish,\n\nTo have him see me woman’d.\n\nBIANCA.    Why, I pray you?\n\nCASSIO. Not that I love you not.\n\nBIANCA.    But that you do not love me:\n\nI pray you bring me on the way a little,\n\nAnd say, if I shall see you soon at night. [200]\n\nCASSIO. ’Tis but a little way that I can bring you,\n\nFor I attend here, but I’ll see you soon.\n\nBIANCA. ’Tis very good, I must be circumstanc’d .\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nAct IV\n\nScene 1\n\nThe same.\n\nEnter Iago and Othello.\n\nIAGO. Will you think so?\n\nOTHELLO.    Think so, Iago?\n\nIAGO.    What,\n\nTo kiss in private?\n\nOTHELLO.    An unauthoriz’d kiss.\n\nIAGO. Or to be naked with her friend abed ,\n\nAn hour, or more, not meaning any harm?\n\nOTHELLO. Naked abed, Iago, and not mean harm? [5]\n\nIt is hypocrisy against the devil:\n\nThey that mean virtuously, and yet do so,\n\nThe devil their virtue tempt s , and they tempt heaven.\n\nIAGO. So they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip ;\n\nBut if I give my wife a handkerchief – [10]\n\nOTHELLO. What then?\n\nIAGO. Why then ’tis hers, my lord, and being hers,\n\nShe may, I think, bestow ’t on any man.\n\nOTHELLO. She is protectress of her honour too,\n\nMay she give that? [15]\n\nIAGO. Her honour is an essence that’s not seen,\n\nThey have it very oft that have it not:\n\nBut for the handkerchief –\n\nOTHELLO. By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it:\n\nThou said’st (O, it comes o’er my memory, [20]\n\nAs doth the raven o’er the infected house,\n\n Boding to all) he had my handkerchief.\n\nIAGO. Ay, what of that?\n\nOTHELLO.    That’s not so good now.\n\nIAGO. What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong?\n\nOr heard him say – as knaves be such abroad, [25]\n\nWho having, by their own importunate suit,\n\nOr voluntary dotage of some mistress,\n\nConvinced or supplied them, cannot choose\n\nBut they must blab –\n\nOTHELLO.    Hath he said anything?\n\nIAGO. He hath, my lord, but be you well assur’d, [30]\n\nNo more than he’ll unswear .\n\nOTHELLO.    What hath he said?\n\nIAGO. Faith, that he did ... I know not what he did.\n\nOTHELLO. But what?\n\nIAGO. Lie.\n\nOTHELLO.    With her?\n\nIAGO.        With her, on her, what you will.\n\nOTHELLO. Lie with her, lie on her? – We say lie on her, [35] when they belie her, – lie with her, zounds, that’s fulsome ! Handkerchief – confessions – handkerchief! To confess, and be hanged for his labour. First, to be hanged, and then to confess; I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such [40]  shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shake me thus. Pish ! Noses, ears and lips. Is ’t possible? – Confess? – Handkerchief? – O devil!\n\n(He falls down.)\n\nIAGO. Work on, [45]\n\nMy medicine, work: thus credulous fools are caught,\n\nAnd many worthy and chaste dames, even thus\n\nAll guiltless, meet reproach. What ho, my lord,\n\nMy lord, I say! Othello! ...\n\n(Enter Cassio.)\n\nHow now, Cassio?\n\nCASSIO. What’s the matter? [50]\n\nIAGO. My lord is fall’n into an epilepsy,\n\nThis is his second fit , he had one yesterday.\n\nCASSIO. Rub him about the temple s .\n\nIAGO.    No, forbear ,\n\nThe lethargy must have his quiet course,\n\nIf not, he foam s at mouth, and by and by [55]\n\nBreaks out to savage madness: look, he stirs:\n\nDo you withdraw yourself a little while,\n\nHe will recover straight; when he is gone,\n\nI would on great occasion speak with you.\n\n(Exit Cassio.)\n\nHow is it, general? have you not hurt your head? [60]\n\nOTHELLO. Dost thou mock me?\n\nIAGO.    I mock you? no, by heaven.\n\nWould you would bear your fortunes like a man!\n\nOTHELLO. A horned man ’s a monster, and a beast.\n\nIAGO. There’s many a beast then in a populous city,\n\nAnd many a civil monster. [65]\n\nOTHELLO. Did he confess?\n\nIAGO.    Good sir, be a man,\n\nThink every bearded fellow that ’s but yok’d\n\nMay draw with you; there’s millions now alive\n\nThat nightly lies in those unproper beds\n\nWhich they dare swear peculiar: your case is better: [70]\n\nO, ’tis the spite of hell, the fiend ’s arch-mock,\n\nTo lip a wanton in a secure couch,\n\nAnd to suppose her chaste. No, let me know,\n\nAnd knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.\n\nOTHELLO. O, thou art wise, ’tis certain.\n\nIAGO.    Stand you awhile apart, [75]\n\n Confine yourself but in a patient list :\n\nWhilst you were here erewhile , mad with your grief –\n\nA passion most unsuiting such a man –\n\nCassio came hither; I shifted him away,\n\nAnd laid good ’scuse upon your ecstasy, [80]\n\nBid him anon return, and here speak with me,\n\nThe which he promis’d: but encave yourself,\n\nAnd mark the jeer s , the gibe s , and notable  scorn s ,\n\nThat dwell in every region of his face;\n\nFor I will make him tell the tale anew, [85]\n\nWhere, how, how oft, how long ago, and when,\n\nHe has, and is again to cope your wife:\n\nI say, but mark his gesture; marry, patience,\n\nOr I shall say you are all in all in spleen ,\n\nAnd nothing of a man.\n\nOTHELLO.    Dost thou hear, Iago? [90]\n\nI will be found most cunning in my patience;\n\nBut – dost thou hear? – most bloody.\n\nIAGO.    That’s not amiss:\n\nBut yet keep time in all; will you withdraw?\n\n(Othello withdraws.)\n\nNow will I question Cassio of Bianca;\n\nA housewife that by selling her desires [95]\n\nBuys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature\n\nThat dotes on Cassio: as ’tis the strumpet ’s plague\n\nTo beguile many, and be beguil’d by one.\n\n(Enter Cassio.)\n\nHe, when he hears of her, cannot refrain\n\nFrom the excess of laughter: here he comes: [100]\n\nAs he shall smile, Othello shall go mad,\n\nAnd his unbookish jealousy must conster\n\nPoor Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and light behaviour,\n\nQuite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?\n\nCASSIO. The worser, that you give me the addition , [105]\n\nWhose want even kills me.\n\nIAGO. Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on ’t.\n\nNow if this suit lay in Bianca’s power,\n\nHow quickly should you speed!\n\nCASSIO.    Alas, poor caitiff !\n\nOTHELLO. Look how he laughs already! [110]\n\nIAGO. I never knew a woman love man so.\n\nCASSIO. Alas, poor rogue , I think i’ faith she loves me.\n\nOTHELLO. Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.\n\nIAGO. Do you hear, Cassio?\n\nOTHELLO.    Now he importunes him\n\nTo tell it on; go to, well said, well said. [115]\n\nIAGO. She gives it out that you shall marry her,\n\nDo you intend it?\n\nCASSIO. Ha, ha, ha!\n\nOTHELLO. Do you triumph, Roman, do you triumph?\n\nCASSIO. I marry her? what? a customer ; [120]\n\nI prithee, bear some charity to my wit,\n\nDo not think it so unwholesome . Ha, ha, ha!\n\nOTHELLO. So, so, so, so; laugh that wins.\n\nIAGO. Faith, the cry goes, you shall marry her.\n\nCASSIO. Prithee say true. [125]\n\nIAGO. I am a very villain else.\n\nOTHELLO. Ha’ you scor’d me? Well.\n\nCASSIO. This is the monkey’s own giving out; she is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery , not out of my promise. [130]\n\nOTHELLO. Iago beckon s me, now he begins the story.\n\nCASSIO. She was here even now, she haunt s me in every place. I was t’ other day talking on the sea-bank, with certain Venetians, and thither comes this bauble ; by this hand, she falls thus about my neck: – [135]\n\nOTHELLO. Crying “O dear Cassio!” as it were: his gesture imports it.\n\nCASSIO. So hangs, and loll s , and weeps upon me; so hales , and pulls me, ha, ha, ha!\n\nOTHELLO. Now he tells how she pluck’d him to my [140] chamber. I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw ’t to.\n\nCASSIO. Well, I must leave her company.\n\n(Enter Bianca.)\n\nIAGO. Before me ! look where she comes.\n\nCASSIO. ’Tis such another fitchew ; marry, a perfum’d one. [145]\n\nWhat do you mean by this haunting of me?\n\nBIANCA. Let the devil and his dam  haunt you, what did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it; I must take out the whole work, a likely piece of work, that you [150] should find it in your chamber, and not know who left it there! This is some minx’s token, and I must take out the work; there, give it the hobby-horse , wheresoever you had it, I’ll take out no work on ’t.\n\nCASSIO. How now, my sweet Bi an ca, how now, how [155] now?\n\nOTHELLO. By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!\n\nBIANCA. An you’ll come to sup per to-night, you may, an you will not, come when you are next prepar’d [160] for.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nIAGO. After her, after her.\n\nCASSIO. Faith, I must, she’ll rail i’ the street else.\n\nIAGO. Will you sup there?\n\nCASSIO. Faith, I intend so. [165]\n\nIAGO. Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak with you.\n\nCASSIO. Prithee come, will you?\n\nIAGO. Go to, say no more.\n\n(Exit Cassio.)\n\nOTHELLO (advancing). How shall I murder him, Iago? [170]\n\nIAGO. Did you perceive, how he laughed at his vice?\n\nOTHELLO. O Iago!\n\nIAGO. And did you see the handkerchief?\n\nOTHELLO. Was that mine?\n\nIAGO. Yours, by this hand: and to see how he prize s  [175] the foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.\n\nOTHELLO. I would have him nine years a-killing; a fine woman, a fair woman, a sweet woman!\n\nIAGO. Nay, you must forget. [180]\n\nOTHELLO. And let her rot , and perish , and be damned to-night, for she shall not live; no, my heart is turn’d to stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand: O, the world has not a sweeter creature, she might lie by an emperor ’s side, and command him tasks. [185]\n\nIAGO. Nay, that’s not your way.\n\nOTHELLO. Hang her, I do but say what she is: so delicate with her needle, an admirable musician, O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear; of so high and plenteous wit and invention ! [190]\n\nIAGO. She’s the worse for all this.\n\nOTHELLO. A thousand thousand times: and then of so gentle a condition!\n\nIAGO. Ay, too gentle.\n\nOTHELLO. Ay, that’s certain, but yet the pity of it, [195] Iago: O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!\n\nIAGO. If you be so fond over her iniquity , give her patent to offend, for if it touches not you, it comes near nobody.\n\nOTHELLO. I will chop her into messes ... Cuckold me! [200]\n\nIAGO. O, ’tis foul in her.\n\nOTHELLO. With mine officer!\n\nIAGO. That’s fouler.\n\nOTHELLO. Get me some poison, Iago, this night; I’ll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty [205]  unprovide my mind again, this night, Iago.\n\nIAGO. Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminate d .\n\nOTHELLO. Good, good, the justice of it pleases, very good. [210]\n\nIAGO. And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker : you shall hear more by midnight.\n\nOTHELLO. Excellent good. (A trumpet within.) What trumpet is that same?\n\n(Enter Lodovico, Desdemona, and Attendants.)\n\nIAGO. Something from Venice, sure; ’tis Lodovico, [215]\n\nCome from the duke, and see, your wife is with him.\n\nLODOVICO. God save the worthy general!\n\nOTHELLO.    With all my heart, sir.\n\nLODOVICO. The duke and senators of Venice greet you.\n\n(Gives him a letter.)\n\nOTHELLO. I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.\n\n(Opens the letter, and reads.)\n\nDESDEMONA. And what’s the news, good cousin Lodovico? [220]\n\nIAGO. I am very glad to see you, signior: ...\n\nWelcome to Cyprus.\n\nLODOVICO. I thank you; how does Lieutenant Cassio?\n\nIAGO. Lives, sir.\n\nDESDEMONA. Cousin, there’s fall’n between him and my lord [225]\n\nAn unkind breach , but you shall make all well.\n\nOTHELLO. Are you sure of that?\n\nDESDEMONA. My lord?\n\nOTHELLO (reads). “This fail you not to do, as you will ...”\n\nLODOVICO. He did not call, he’s busy in the paper: [230]\n\nIs there division between thy lord and Cassio?\n\nDESDEMONA. A most unhappy one; I would do much\n\nTo atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.\n\nOTHELLO. Fire and brimstone !\n\nDESDEMONA.    My lord?\n\nOTHELLO.        Are you wise?\n\nDESDEMONA. What, is he angry?\n\nLODOVICO.    May be the letter mov’d him; [235]\n\nFor, as I think, they do command him home,\n\n Deputing Cassio in his government.\n\nDESDEMONA. By my troth , I am glad on ’t.\n\nOTHELLO.    Indeed!\n\nDESDEMONA.        My lord?\n\nOTHELLO. I am glad to see you mad.\n\nDESDEMONA.    How, sweet Othello?\n\nOTHELLO. Devil! [240]\n\n(Striking her.)\n\nDESDEMONA. I have not deserv’d this.\n\nLODOVICO. My lord, this would not be believ’d in Venice,\n\nThough I should swear I saw ’t: ’tis very much,\n\n Make her amends , she weeps.\n\nOTHELLO.    O devil, devil!\n\nIf that the earth could teem with women’s tears, [245]\n\nEach drop she falls would prove a crocodile:\n\nOut of my sight!\n\nDESDEMONA.    I will not stay to offend you.\n\n(Going.)\n\nLODOVICO. Truly, an obedient lady:\n\nI do beseech your lordship, call her back.\n\nOTHELLO. Mistress! [250]\n\nDESDEMONA. My lord?\n\nOTHELLO. What would you with her, sir?\n\nLODOVICO.    Who, I, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO. Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn:\n\nSir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,\n\nAnd turn again, and she can weep, sir, weep; [255]\n\nAnd she’s obedient, as you say, obedient;\n\nVery obedient. Proceed you in your tears.\n\nConcerning this, sir, – O well-painted passion! –\n\nI am commanded here: ... get you away,\n\nI’ll send for you anon ... Sir, I obey the mandate, [260]\n\nAnd will return to Venice: ... Hence, avaunt !\n\n(Exit Desdemona.)\n\nCassio shall have my place; and, sir, to-night,\n\nI do entreat that we may sup together,\n\nYou are welcome, sir, to Cyprus ... Goats and monkeys!\n\n(Exit.)\n\nLODOVICO. Is this the noble Moor, whom our full senate [265]\n\nCall all in all sufficient ? This the noble nature,\n\nWhom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue\n\nThe shot of accident, nor dart of chance,\n\nCould neither graze , nor pierce?\n\nIAGO.    He is much chang’d.\n\nLODOVICO. Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain? [270]\n\nIAGO. He’s that he is; I may not breathe my censure ,\n\nWhat he might be; if, as he might, he is not,\n\nI would to heaven he were!\n\nLODOVICO.    What, strike his wife?\n\nIAGO. Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew\n\nThat stroke would prove the worst!\n\nLODOVICO.    Is it his use? [275]\n\nOr did the letters work upon his blood,\n\nAnd new create this fault?\n\nIAGO.    Alas, alas!\n\nIt is not honesty in me to speak\n\nWhat I have seen and known; you shall observe him,\n\nAnd his own courses will denote him so, [280]\n\nThat I may save my speech: do but go after,\n\nAnd mark how he continues.\n\nLODOVICO. I am sorry that I am deceiv’d in him.\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nScene 2\n\nA Room in the Castle.\n\nEnter Othello and Emilia.\n\nOTHELLO. You have seen nothing, then?\n\nEMILIA. Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.\n\nOTHELLO. Yes, and you have seen Cassio and she together.\n\nEMILIA. But then I saw no harm, and then I heard\n\nEach syllable that breath made up between ’em. [5]\n\nOTHELLO. What, did they never whisper?\n\nEMILIA.    Never, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO. Nor send you out o’ the way?\n\nEMILIA. Never.\n\nOTHELLO. To fetch her fan , her mask, her gloves, nor nothing?\n\nEMILIA. Never, my lord. [10]\n\nOTHELLO. That’s strange.\n\nEMILIA. I durst , my lord, to wager she is honest,\n\nLay down my soul at stake : if you think other,\n\nRemove your thought, it doth abuse your bosom;\n\nIf any wretch ha’ put this in your head, [15]\n\nLet heaven requite it with the serpent ’s curse,\n\nFor if she be not honest, chaste, and true,\n\nThere’s no man happy, the purest of her sex\n\nIs foul as slander.\n\nOTHELLO.    Bid her come hither, go.\n\n(Exit Emilia.)\n\nShe says enough, yet she’s a simple bawd  [20]\n\nThat cannot say as much: this is a subtle whore,\n\nA closet , lock and key, of villainous secrets,\n\nAnd yet she’ll kneel and pray, I ha’ seen her do ’t.\n\n(Enter Desdemona and Emilia.)\n\nDESDEMONA. My lord, what is your will?\n\nOTHELLO.    Pray, chuck, come hither.\n\nDESDEMONA. What is your pleasure?\n\nOTHELLO.    Let me see your eyes, ... [25]\n\nLook in my face.\n\nDESDEMONA.   What horrible fancy ’s this?\n\nOTHELLO (to Emilia). Some of your function , mistress,\n\nLeave procreant s alone, and shut the door,\n\nCough, or cry hem , if anybody come;\n\nYour mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch . [30]\n\n(Exit Emilia.)\n\nDESDEMONA.\n\nUpon my knees, what does your speech import?\n\nI understand a fury in your words,\n\nBut not the words.\n\nOTHELLO. Why, what art thou?\n\nDESDEMONA. Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife. [35]\n\nOTHELLO. Come, swear it, damn thyself,\n\nLest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves\n\nShould fear to seize thee, therefore be double-damn’d,\n\nSwear thou art honest.\n\nDESDEMONA.    Heaven doth truly know it.\n\nOTHELLO. Heaven truly knows, that thou art false as hell. [40]\n\nDESDEMONA. To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?\n\nOTHELLO. O Desdemona, away! away! away!\n\nDESDEMONA. Alas the heavy day, why do you weep?\n\nAm I the occasion of those tears, my lord?\n\nIf haply you my father do suspect [45]\n\nAn instrument of this your calling back,\n\nLay not your blame on me; if you have lost him,\n\nWhy, I have lost him too.\n\nOTHELLO.    Had it pleas’d heaven\n\nTo try me with affliction , had he rain’d\n\nAll kinds of sore s and shames on my bare head, [50]\n\n Steep ’d me in poverty , to the very lips,\n\nGiven to captivity me and my hopes,\n\nI should have found in some part of my soul\n\nA drop of patience; but, alas, to make me\n\nA fixed figure, for the time of scorn  [55]\n\nTo point his slow unmoving fingers at ... oh, oh.\n\nYet could I bear that too, well, very well:\n\nBut there, where I have garner’d up my heart,\n\nWhere either I must live, or bear no life,\n\nThe fountain , from the which my current runs, [60]\n\nOr else dries up, to be discard ed thence,\n\nOr keep it as a cistern, for foul toads\n\nTo knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there;\n\nPatience, thou young and rose-lipp’d cherubin,\n\nI here look grim as hell! [65]\n\nDESDEMONA. I hope my noble lord esteem s me honest.\n\nOTHELLO. O, ay, as summer’s flies, are in the shambles ,\n\nThat quicken even with blowing :\n\nO thou black weed , why art so lovely fair?\n\nThou smell’st so sweet, that the sense aches at thee, [70]\n\nWould thou hadst ne’er been born!\n\nDESDEMONA. Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed ?\n\nOTHELLO. Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,\n\nMade to write “whore” on? ... What, committed?\n\nCommitted! O thou public commoner ! [75]\n\nI should make very forge s of my cheeks,\n\nThat would to cinders burn up modesty,\n\nDid I but speak thy deeds. What committed!\n\nHeaven stops the nose at it, and the moon wink s ,\n\nThe bawdy wind, that kisses all it meets, [80]\n\nIs hush ’d within the hollow mine of earth,\n\nAnd will not hear ’t: ... what committed, –\n\n Impudent strumpet!\n\nDESDEMONA.    By heaven, you do me wrong.\n\nOTHELLO. Are not you a strumpet?\n\nDESDEMONA.    No, as I am a Christian:\n\nIf to preserve this vessel for my lord [85]\n\nFrom any hated foul unlawful touch,\n\nBe not to be a strumpet, I am none.\n\nOTHELLO. What, not a whore?\n\nDESDEMONA.    No, as I shall be sav’d.\n\n(Enter Emilia.)\n\nOTHELLO. Is ’t possible?\n\nDESDEMONA. O heaven, forgiveness.\n\nOTHELLO.    I cry you mercy, [90]\n\nI took you for that cunning whore of Venice,\n\nThat married with Othello: you, mistress,\n\nThat have the office opposite to Saint Peter,\n\nAnd keeps the gates in hell, ay, you, you, you!\n\nWe ha’ done our course; there’s money for your pains, [95]\n\nI pray you turn the key, and keep our counsel.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nEMILIA. Alas, what does this gentleman conceive ?\n\nHow do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?\n\nDESDEMONA. Faith, half asleep.\n\nEMILIA. Good madam, what’s the matter with my lord? [100]\n\nDESDEMONA. With who?\n\nEMILIA. Why, with my lord, madam.\n\nDESDEMONA. Who is thy lord?\n\nEMILIA.    He that is yours, sweet lady.\n\nDESDEMONA. I ha’ none, do not talk to me, Emilia,\n\nI cannot weep, nor answer have I none, [105]\n\nBut what should go by water: prithee, to-night\n\nLay on my bed our wedding sheets ; remember,\n\nAnd call thy husband hither.\n\nEMILIA.    Here is a change indeed!\n\n(Exit.)\n\nDESDEMONA. ’Tis meet I should be us’d so, very well;\n\nHow have I been behav’d, that he might stick [110]\n\nThe smallest opinion, on my greatest abuse?\n\n(Enter Iago and Emilia.)\n\nIAGO. What is your pleasure, madam? How is’t with you?\n\nDESDEMONA.\n\nI cannot tell: those that do teach young babe s\n\nDo it with gentle means, and easy tasks;\n\nHe might ha’ chid me so, for, in good faith, [115]\n\nI am a child at chiding.\n\nIAGO.    What is the matter, lady?\n\nEMILIA. Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhor’d her,\n\nThrown such despite , and heavy term s upon her,\n\nAs true hearts cannot bear.\n\nDESDEMONA. Am I that name, Iago?\n\nIAGO.    What name, fair lady? [120]\n\nDESDEMONA. Such as she says my lord did say I was?\n\nEMILIA. He call’d her whore: a beggar in his drink\n\nCould not have laid such terms upon his callat .\n\nIAGO. Why did he so?\n\nDESDEMONA. I do not know, I am sure I am none such. [125]\n\nIAGO. Do not weep, do not weep: alas the day!\n\nEMILIA. Has she forsook so many noble matches,\n\nHer father, and her country, all her friends,\n\nTo be call’d whore? would it not make one weep?\n\nDESDEMONA. It is my wretched fortune.\n\nIAGO. Beshrew him for it! [130]\n\nHow comes this trick upon him?\n\nDESDEMONA.    Nay, heaven doth know.\n\nEMILIA. I will be hang’d, if some eternal villain,\n\nSome busy and insinuating rogue,\n\nSome cogging , cozening slave, to get some office,\n\nHave not devis’d this slander, I’ll be hang’d else. [135]\n\nIAGO. Fie, there is no such man, it is impossible.\n\nDESDEMONA. If any such there be, heaven pardon him!\n\nEMILIA. A halter pardon him, and hell gnaw his bones!\n\nWhy should he call her whore? who keeps her company?\n\nWhat place, what time, what form, what likelihood ? [140]\n\nThe Moor’s abus’d by some outrageous knave,\n\nSome base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow;\n\nO heaven, that such companions thou ’ldst unfold,\n\nAnd put in every honest hand a whip,\n\nTo lash the rascal naked through the world, [145]\n\nEven from the east to the west!\n\nIAGO.    Speak within doors.\n\nEMILIA. O, fie upon him! Some such squire he was,\n\nThat turn’d your wit, the seamy side without,\n\nAnd made you to suspect me with the Moor.\n\nIAGO. You are a fool, go to.\n\nDESDEMONA.    O good Iago, [150]\n\nWhat shall I do to win my lord again?\n\nGood friend, go to him, for, by this light of heaven,\n\nI know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:\n\nIf e’er my will did trespass ’gainst his love\n\nEither in discourse of thought or actual deed, [155]\n\nOr that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,\n\nDelighted them in any other form,\n\nOr that I do not yet, and ever did,\n\nAnd ever will (though he do shake me off\n\nTo beggarly divorcement ) love him dearly, [160]\n\nComfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;\n\nAnd his unkindness may defeat my life,\n\nBut never taint my love. I cannot say “whore”:\n\nIt does abhor me now I speak the word;\n\nTo do the act that might the addition earn [165]\n\nNot the world’s mass of vanity could make me.\n\nIAGO. I pray you, be content, ’tis but his humour,\n\nThe business of the state does him offence,\n\nAnd he does chide with you.\n\nDESDEMONA. If’twere no other, –\n\nIAGO.    ’Tis but so, I warrant you; [170]\n\n(Trumpets.)\n\nHark, how these instruments summon you to supper,\n\nAnd the great messengers of Venice stay:\n\nGo in, and weep not, all things shall be well.\n\n(Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.)\n\n(Enter Roderigo.)\n\nHow now, Roderigo?\n\nRODERIGO. I do not find that thou deal’st justly with me. [175]\n\nIAGO. What in the contrary?\n\nRODERIGO. Every day thou doff est me with some device, Iago, and rather, as it seems to me, thou keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope: I will indeed no longer [180] endure it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered.\n\nIAGO. Will you hear me, Roderigo?\n\nRODERIGO. Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and performance are no kin together. [185]\n\nIAGO. You charge me most unjustly.\n\nRODERIGO. With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of means: the jewels you have had from me, to deliver to Desdemona, would half have corrupted a votarist . You have told me she has [190] receiv’d ’em, and return’d me expectation, and comforts, of sudden respect, and acquittance , but I find none.\n\nIAGO. Well, go to, very well.\n\nRODERIGO. Very well, go to, I cannot go to, man, it is [195] not very well, by this hand, I say ’tis very scurvy, and begin to find myself fopp’d in it.\n\nIAGO. Very well.\n\nRODERIGO. I say it is not very well: I will make myself known to Desdemona; if she will return me my [200] jewels, I will give over my suit, and repent my unlawful solicitation , if not, assure yourself I’ll seek satisfaction of you.\n\nIAGO. You have said now.\n\nRODERIGO. Ay, and I have said nothing but what I [205] protest intendment of doing.\n\nIAGO. Why, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even from this time to build on thee a better opinion than ever before, give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast taken against me a most just exception , but yet I [210] protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affairs.\n\nRODERIGO. It hath not appear’d.\n\nIAGO. I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgement: but, Roderigo, if thou hast that within thee indeed, [215] which I have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean purpose, courage, and valour , this night show it; if thou the next night following enjoyest not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery , and devise engine s for my life. [220]\n\nRODERIGO. Well, is it within reason and compass?\n\nIAGO. Sir, there is especial command come from Venice, to depute Cassio in Othello’s place.\n\nRODERIGO. Is that true? why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice. [225]\n\nIAGO. O no, he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be linger ’d here by some accident, wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.\n\nRODERIGO. How do you mean, removing of him? [230]\n\nIAGO. Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s place, knocking out his brains.\n\nRODERIGO. And that you would have me to do.\n\nIAGO. Ay, and if you dare do yourself a profit and right, he sups to-night with a harlot , and thither will I go [235] to him; ... he knows not yet of his honourable fortune: if you will watch his going thence, which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one, you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us: come, [240] stand not amaz’d at it, but go along with me, I will show you such a necessity in his death, that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows to waste: about it. [245]\n\nRODERIGO. I will hear further reason for this.\n\nIAGO. And you shall be satisfied.\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nScene 3\n\nAnother Room in the Castle.\n\nEnter Othello, Lodovico, Desdemona, Emilia, and Attendants.\n\nLODOVICO. I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.\n\nOTHELLO. O, pardon me, it shall do me good to walk.\n\nLODOVICO. Madame, good night. I humbly thank your ladyship.\n\nDESDEMONA. Your honour is most welcome.\n\nOTHELLO.    Will you walk, sir? ...\n\nO Desdemona, – [5]\n\nDESDEMONA. My lord?\n\nOTHELLO. Get you to bed, o’ the instant I will be return’d, forthwith , dispatch your attendant there: ... look it be done.\n\nDESDEMONA. I will, my lord. [10]\n\n(Exeunt Othello, Lodovico, and Attendants.)\n\nEMILIA. How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.\n\nDESDEMONA. He says he will return incontinent:\n\nHe hath commanded me to go to bed,\n\nAnd bade me to dismiss you.\n\nEMILIA.    Dismiss me?\n\nDESDEMONA. It was his bidding, therefore, good Emilia, [15]\n\nGive me my nightly wearing , and adieu,\n\nWe must not now displease him.\n\nEMILIA. I would you had never seen him!\n\nDESDEMONA. So would not I, my love doth so approve him,\n\nThat even his stubbornness , his check s and frown s , – [20]\n\nPrithee unpin me, – have grace and favour in them.\n\nEMILIA. I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.\n\nDESDEMONA. All’s one, good faith: how foolish are our minds!\n\nIf I do die before thee, prithee shroud me\n\nIn one of those same sheets.\n\nEMILIA.    Come, come, you talk. [25]\n\nDESDEMONA. My mother had a maid call’d Barbary,\n\nShe was in love, and he she lov’d prov’d mad,\n\nAnd did forsake her; she had a song of “ willow ”,\n\nAn old thing ’twas, but it express’d her fortune,\n\nAnd she died singing it; that song to-night [30]\n\nWill not go from my mind ... I have much to do,\n\nBut to go hang my head all at one side\n\nAnd sing it like poor Barbary: prithee dispatch.\n\nEMILIA. Shall I go fetch your night-gown?\n\nDESDEMONA.    No, unpin me here;\n\nThis Lodovico is a proper man. [35]\n\nEMILIA. A very handsome man.\n\nDESDEMONA. He speaks well.\n\nEMILIA. I know a lady in Venice would have walk’d barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.\n\nDESDEMONA (singing).\n\nThe poor soul sat sighing, by a sycamore tree, [40]\n\nSing all a green willow:\n\nHer hand on her bosom her head on her knee,\n\nSing willow, willow, willow.\n\nThe fresh streams ran by her, and murmur ’d her moan s ,\n\nSing willow, willow, willow. [45]\n\nHer salt tears fell from her, which soften’d the stones: –\n\nLay by these: –\n\nSing willow, willow, willow.\n\nPrithee hie  thee: he’ll come anon: –\n\nSing all a green willow must be my garland . [50]\n\nLet nobody blame him, his scorn I approve, –\n\nNay, that’s not next. Hark! who’s that knocks?\n\nEMILIA. It is the wind.\n\nDESDEMONA.\n\nI call’d my love false love; but what said he then?\n\nSing willow, willow, willow: [55]\n\nIf I court moe women, you’ll couch with moe men.\n\nNow get thee gone; good night: mine eyes do itch ,\n\nDoes that bode weeping?\n\nEMILIA.    ’Tis neither here nor there.\n\nDESDEMONA. I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!\n\nDost thou in conscience think, – tell me, Emilia, – [60]\n\nThat there be women do abuse their husbands\n\nIn such gross kind?\n\nEMILIA.    There be some such, no question.\n\nDESDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed, for all the world?\n\nEMILIA. Why, would not you?\n\nDESDEMONA.    No, by this heavenly light!\n\nEMILIA. Nor I neither, by this heavenly light, [65]\n\nI might do it as well in the dark.\n\nDESDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a thing for all the world?\n\nEMILIA. The world is a huge thing, it is a great price,\n\nFor a small vice.\n\nDESDEMONA. Good troth , I think thou wouldst not.\n\nEMILIA. By my troth, I think I should, and undo ’t [70] when I had done it; marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring ; or for measures of lawn , nor for gown s , or petticoats, nor caps, nor any such exhibition; but, for the whole world? ud’s pity, who would not make her husband a cuckold, to make [75] him a monarch? I should venture  purgatory for it.\n\nDESDEMONA. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong,\n\nFor the whole world.\n\nEMILIA. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i’ the world; and having the world for your labour, ’tis a wrong in [80] your own world, and you might quickly make it right.\n\nDESDEMONA. I do not think there is any such woman.\n\nEMILIA. Yes, a dozen, and as many to the vantage , as would\n\nstore the world they played for. [85]\n\nBut I do think it is their husbands’ faults\n\nIf wives do fall: say, that they slack their duties,\n\nAnd pour our treasures into foreign lap s ;\n\nOr else break out in peevish jealousies,\n\nThrowing restraint upon us: or say they strike us, [90]\n\nOr scant our former having in despite,\n\nWhy, we have galls: and though we have some grace,\n\nYet have we some revenge. Let husbands know,\n\nTheir wives have sense like them: they see, and smell,\n\nAnd have their palates both for sweet, and sour, [95]\n\nAs husbands have. What is it that they do,\n\nWhen they change us for others? Is it sport?\n\nI think it is: and doth affection breed it?\n\nI think it doth. Is ’t frailty that thus errs?\n\nIt is so too. And have not we affections? [100]\n\nDesires for sport? and frailty, as men have?\n\nThen let them use us well: else let them know,\n\nThe ills we do, their ills instruct us so.\n\nDESDEMONA. Good night, good night: God me such usage send,\n\nNot to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend! [105]\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nAct V\n\nScene 1\n\nA Street.\n\nEnter Iago and Roderigo.\n\nIAGO. Here stand behind this bulk , straight will he come,\n\nWear thy good rapier bare, and put it home,\n\nQuick, quick, fear nothing, I’ll be at thy elbow;\n\nIt makes us or it mar s us, think of that,\n\nAnd fix most firm thy resolution . [5]\n\nRODERIGO. Be near at hand, I may miscarry in ’t .\n\nIAGO. Here at thy hand, be bold, and take thy sword.\n\n(Retires.)\n\nRODERIGO. I have no great devotion to the deed;\n\nAnd yet he has given me satisfying reasons,\n\n’Tis but a man gone: forth, my sword, he dies. [10]\n\nIAGO. I have rubb’d this young quat almost to the sense,\n\nAnd he grows angry now: whether he kill Cassio,\n\nOr Cassio him, or each do kill the other,\n\nEvery way makes my game; live Roderigo,\n\nHe calls me to a restitution large, [15]\n\nFor gold and jewels, that I bob b’d from him,\n\nAs gifts to Desdemona:\n\nIt must not be; if Cassio do remain,\n\nHe has a daily beauty in his life,\n\nThat makes me ugly: and besides, the Moor [20]\n\nMay unfold me to him; there stand I in peril :\n\nNo, he must die, be ’t so, I hear him coming.\n\n(Enter Cassio.)\n\nRODERIGO. I know his gait , ’tis he, villain, thou diest!\n\n(Makes a pass at Cassio.)\n\nCASSIO. That thrust had been my enemy indeed,\n\nBut that my coat is better than thou think’st; [25]\n\nI will make proof of thine.\n\n(Draws, and wounds Roderigo.)\n\nRODERIGO.    O, I am slain!\n\n(Iago from behind wounds Cassio in the leg, and exit.)\n\nCASSIO. I am maim’d for ever, light, ho, murder, murder!\n\n(Falls.)\n\n(Enter Othello.)\n\nOTHELLO. The voice of Cassio, Iago keeps his word.\n\nRODERIGO. O villain that I am!\n\nOTHELLO.    Hark, ’tis even so.\n\nCASSIO. O, help, ho! light! a surgeon! [30]\n\nOTHELLO. ’Tis he, O brave Iago, honest and just,\n\nThat hast such noble sense of thy friend’s wrong,\n\nThou teachest me; ... minion , your dear lies dead,\n\nAnd your fate hie s  apace ; strumpet, I come;\n\nForth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted , [35]\n\nThy bed, lust-stain’d, shall with lust’s blood be spotted.\n\n(Exit.)\n\n(Enter Lodovico and Gratiano.)\n\nCASSIO. What ho, no watch, no passage? murder, murder!\n\nGRATIANO. ’Tis some mischance , the cry is very direful .\n\nCASSIO. O, help!\n\nLODOVICO. Hark! [40]\n\nRODERIGO. O wretched villain.\n\nLODOVICO. Two or three groan s ; it is a heavy night,\n\nThese may be counterfeit s , let’s think ’t unsafe\n\nTo come into the cry without more help.\n\nRODERIGO. Nobody come; then shall I bleed to death. [45]\n\n(Enter Iago with a light.)\n\nLODOVICO. Hark!\n\nGRATIANO. Here’s one comes in his shirt, with lights and weapons.\n\nIAGO. Who’s there? whose noise is this, that cries on murder?\n\nLODOVICO. I do not know.\n\nIAGO.    Did not you hear a cry?\n\nCASSIO. Here, here, for heaven’s sake help me!\n\nIAGO.    What’s the matter? [50]\n\nGRATIANO. This is Othello’s ancient, as I take it.\n\nLODOVICO. The same indeed, a very valiant fellow.\n\nIAGO. What are you here, that cry so grievously ?\n\nCASSIO. Iago! O, I am spoil’d, undone by villains,\n\nGive me some help. [55]\n\nIAGO. O, my lieutenant! what villains have done this?\n\nCASSIO. I think the one of them is hereabout,\n\nAnd cannot make away.\n\nIAGO.    O treacherous villains!\n\nWhat are you there? come in and give some help.\n\n(To Lodovico and Gratiano.)\n\nRODERIGO. O, help me here! [60]\n\nCASSIO. That’s one of ’em.\n\nIAGO.    O murderous slave, O villain!\n\n(Stabs Roderigo.)\n\nRODERIGO. O damn’d Iago, O inhuman dog, ... oh, oh, oh.\n\nIAGO. Kill him i’ the dark? Where be those bloody thieves?\n\nHow silent is this town! Ho, murder, murder!\n\nWhat may you be, are you of good or evil? [65]\n\nLODOVICO. As you shall prove us, praise us.\n\nIAGO. Signior Lodovico?\n\nLODOVICO. He, sir.\n\nIAGO. I cry you mercy: here’s Cassio hurt by villains.\n\nGRATIANO. Cassio! [70]\n\nIAGO. How is it, brother?\n\nCASSIO. My leg is cut in two.\n\nIAGO.    Marry, heaven forbid!\n\nLight, gentlemen, I’ll bind it with my shirt.\n\n(Enter Bianca.)\n\nBIANCA. What is the matter, ho? who is ’t that cried?\n\nIAGO. Who is ’t that cried? [75]\n\nBIANCA. O my dear Cassio, O my sweet Cassio!\n\nCassio, Cassio!\n\nIAGO. O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect\n\nWho they should be, that thus have mangle d you?\n\nCASSIO. No. [80]\n\nGRATIANO. I am sorry to find you thus, I have been to seek you.\n\nIAGO. Lend me a garter . So: – O for a chair,\n\nTo bear him easily hence!\n\nBIANCA. Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!\n\nIAGO. Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash [85]\n\nTo bear a part in this: patience awhile, good Cassio:\n\nLend me a light; know we this face, or no?\n\nAlas, my friend, and my dear countryman:\n\nRoderigo? no, – yes, sure: O heaven, Roderigo.\n\nGRATIANO. What, of Venice? [90]\n\nIAGO. Even he, sir, did you know him?\n\nGRATIANO.    Know him? ay.\n\nIAGO. Signior Gratiano, I cry you gentle pardon:\n\nThese bloody accidents must excuse my manners,\n\nThat so neglected you.\n\nGRATIANO.    I am glad to see you.\n\nIAGO. How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair! [95]\n\nGRATIANO. Roderigo!\n\nIAGO. He, ’tis he.\n\n(A chair brought in.)\n\nO, that’s well said, a chair:\n\nSome good man bear him carefully from hence,\n\nI’ll fetch the general’s surgeon: (to Bianca) for you, mistress, [100]\n\nSave you your labour; – he that lies slain here, Cassio,\n\nWas my dear friend, what malice was betwixt you?\n\nCASSIO. None in the world, nor do I know the man.\n\nIAGO (to Bianca) . What, look you pale? – O, bear him out o’ the air.\n\n(Cassio and Roderigo are borne off.)\n\nStay you, good gentlewoman; look you pale, mistress? [105]\n\nDo you perceive the gestures of her eye?\n\nNay, an you stir, – we shall have more anon:\n\nBehold her well I pray you, look upon her,\n\nDo you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness\n\nWill speak, though tongues were out of use. [110]\n\n(Enter Emilia.)\n\nEMILIA. ’Las , what’s the matter? what’s the matter, husband?\n\nIAGO. Cassio has here been set on in the dark,\n\nBy Roderigo, and fellows that are ’scap’d,\n\nHe’s almost slain, and Roderigo dead.\n\nEMILIA. Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio! [115]\n\nIAGO. This is the fruit of whoring; pray, Emilia,\n\nGo know of Cassio where he supp’d to-night:\n\nWhat, do you shake at that?\n\nBIANCA. He supp’d at my house, but I therefore shake not.\n\nIAGO. O, did he so? I charge you go with me. [120]\n\nEMILIA. Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!\n\nBIANCA. I am no strumpet, but of life as honest\n\nAs you, that thus abuse me.\n\nEMILIA.    As I? faugh , fie upon thee!\n\nIAGO. Kind gentlemen, let’s go see poor Cassio dress’d ;\n\nCome, mistress, you must tell ’s another tale. [125]\n\nEmilia, run you to the citadel,\n\nAnd tell my lord and lady what has happ’d:\n\nWill you go on, I pray? (Aside.) This is the night\n\nThat either makes me, or fordo es me quite.\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nScene 2\n\nA Bedchamber in the Castle.\n\nDesdemona in bed asleep. Enter Othello, with a light.\n\nOTHELLO. It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,\n\nLet me not name it to you, you chaste stars:\n\nIt is the cause, yet I’ll not shed her blood,\n\nNor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,\n\nAnd smooth, as monumental alabaster; [5]\n\nYet she must die, else she’ll betray more men.\n\nPut out the light, and then put out the light:\n\nIf I quench thee, thou flaming minister ,\n\nI can again thy former light restore ,\n\nShould I repent me; but once put out thine, [10]\n\nThou cunning pattern of excelling nature,\n\nI know not where is that Promethean heat\n\nThat can thy light relume : when I have pluck’d the rose,\n\nI cannot give it vital growth again,\n\nIt must needs wither ; I’ll smell it on the tree, [15]\n\n(Kisses her. )\n\nA balmy breath, that doth almost persuade\n\nJustice herself to break her sword: once more:\n\nBe thus, when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,\n\nAnd love thee after: once more, and this the last,\n\nSo sweet was ne’er so fatal: I must weep, [20]\n\nBut they are cruel tears; this sorrow’s heavenly,\n\nIt strikes when it does love: she wakes.\n\nDESDEMONA. Who’s there? Othello?\n\nOTHELLO.    Ay, Desdemona.\n\nDESDEMONA. Will you come to bed, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO. Have you pray’d to-night, Desdemona?\n\nDESDEMONA.    Ay, my lord. [25]\n\nOTHELLO. If you bethink yourself of any crime,\n\n Unreconcil’d as yet to heaven and grace,\n\n Solicit for it straight.\n\nDESDEMONA. Alas, my lord, what may you mean by that?\n\nOTHELLO. Well, do it, and be brief, I will walk by, [30]\n\nI would not kill thy unprepared spirit,\n\nNo, heaven forfend , I would not kill thy soul.\n\nDESDEMONA. Talk you of killing?\n\nOTHELLO.    Ay, I do.\n\nDESDEMONA.        Then heaven\n\nHave mercy on me!\n\nOTHELLO.    Amen, with all my heart!\n\nDESDEMONA. If you say so, I hope you will not kill me. [35]\n\nOTHELLO. Hum!\n\nDESDEMONA. And yet I fear you, for you are fatal then,\n\nWhen your eyes roll so: why I should fear, I know not,\n\n Sin ce guiltiness I know not, but yet I feel I fear.\n\nOTHELLO. Think on thy sins.\n\nDESDEMONA.    They are loves I bear to you. [40]\n\nOTHELLO. And for that thou diest.\n\nDESDEMONA. That death’s unnatural, that kills for loving;\n\nAlas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?\n\nSome bloody passion shakes your very frame,\n\nThese are portent s ; but yet I hope, I hope, [45]\n\nThey do not point on me.\n\nOTHELLO.    Peace, and be still!\n\nDESDEMONA. I will, so, what’s the matter?\n\nOTHELLO. That handkerchief which I so lov’d, and gave thee,\n\nThou gavest to Cassio.\n\nDESDEMONA.    No, by my life and soul,\n\nSend for the man and ask him. [50]\n\nOTHELLO. Sweet soul, take heed, take heed of perjury ,\n\nThou art on thy death-bed.\n\nDESDEMONA.    Ay, but not yet to die.\n\nOTHELLO. Yes, presently:\n\nTherefore confess thee freely of thy sin,\n\nFor to deny each article with oath  [55]\n\nCannot remove, nor choke the strong conceit,\n\nThat I do groan withal: thou art to die.\n\nDESDEMONA. Then Lord have mercy on me!\n\nOTHELLO.    I say, amen.\n\nDESDEMONA. And have you mercy too! I never did\n\nOffend you in my life, ... never lov’d Cassio, [60]\n\nBut with such general warranty of heaven,\n\nAs I might love: I never gave him token.\n\nOTHELLO. By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in his hand:\n\nO perjur’d woman, thou dost stone thy heart,\n\nAnd makest me call what I intend to do [65]\n\nA murder, which I thought a sacrifice;\n\nI saw the handkerchief.\n\nDESDEMONA.    He found it then,\n\nI never gave it him, send for him hither,\n\nAnd let him confess a truth.\n\nOTHELLO.    He hath confess’d.\n\nDESDEMONA. What, my lord? [70]\n\nOTHELLO. That he hath ... us’d thee.\n\nDESDEMONA.    How? unlawfully?\n\nOTHELLO. Ay.\n\nDESDEMONA.    He will not say so.\n\nOTHELLO.         No, his mouth is stopp’d,\n\nHonest Iago hath ta’en order for ’t.\n\nDESDEMONA. My fear interprets then, ...\n\nWhat, is he dead?\n\nOTHELLO.    Had all his hairs been lives, [75]\n\nMy great revenge had stomach for ’em all.\n\nDESDEMONA. Alas, he is betray’d, and I undone.\n\nOTHELLO. O strumpet, ... weepest thou for him to my face?\n\nDESDEMONA. O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not.\n\nOTHELLO. Down, strumpet! [80]\n\nDESDEMONA. Kill me to-morrow, let me live to-night.\n\nOTHELLO. Nay, an you strive, –\n\nDESDEMONA. But half an hour, but while I say one prayer!\n\nOTHELLO. ’Tis too late.\n\n(He stifle s her.)\n\nDESDEMONA. O Lord, Lord, Lord! [85]\n\nEMILIA (within). My lord, my lord! what, ho, my lord, my lord!\n\nOTHELLO. What voice is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?\n\nI that am cruel, am yet merciful,\n\nI would not have thee linger in thy pain, ...\n\nSo, so.\n\nEMILIA (within). What ho, my lord, my lord!\n\nOTHELLO.    Who’s there? [90]\n\nEMILIA (within). O good my lord, I ’ld speak a word with you!\n\nOTHELLO. Yes, ’tis Emilia, by and by: she’s dead:\n\n’Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio’s death;\n\nThe noise was here; ha, no more moving,\n\nStill as the grave: shall she come in? were ’t good? [95]\n\nI think she stirs again; no, what’s the best?\n\nIf she come in, she’ll sure speak to my wife.\n\nMy wife, my wife, my wife; I ha’ no wife;\n\nO, insupportable ! O heavy hour!\n\nMethinks it should be now a huge eclipse  [100]\n\nOf sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe\n\nShould yawn at alteration .\n\nEMILIA (within). I do beseech you I may speak with you, ...\n\nGood my lord!\n\nOTHELLO. I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia. [105]\n\nSoft, by and by; let me the curtains draw.\n\nWhere art thou?\n\n(Unlocks the door.)\n\n(Enter Emilia.)\n\nWhat’s the matter with thee now?\n\nEMILIA. O, my good lord, yonder ’s foul murders done!\n\nOTHELLO. What, now?\n\nEMILIA.    But now, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO. It is the very error of the moon, [110]\n\n She comes more near the earth than she was wont,\n\nAnd makes men mad.\n\nEMILIA. Cassio, my lord, has kill’d a young Venetian,\n\nCall’d Roderigo.\n\nOTHELLO.    Roderigo kill’d,\n\nAnd Cassio kill’d?\n\nEMILIA.    No, Cassio is not kill’d. [115]\n\nOTHELLO. Not Cassio kill’d? then murder ’s out of tune,\n\nAnd sweet revenge grows harsh .\n\nDESDEMONA. O, falsely, falsely murder’d!\n\nEMILIA.    O Lord, what cry is that?\n\nOTHELLO. That? what?\n\nEMILIA. Out and alas! it is my lady’s voice; [120]\n\nHelp, help, ho, help! O lady, speak again,\n\nSweet Desdemona, O sweet mistress, speak!\n\nDESDEMONA. A guiltless death I die.\n\nEMILIA. O, who has done this deed?\n\nDESDEMONA. Nobody, I myself, farewell: [125]\n\n Commend me to my kind lord, O, farewell!\n\n(She dies.)\n\nOTHELLO. Why, how should she be murder’d?\n\nEMILIA.    Alas, who knows?\n\nOTHELLO. You heard her say, herself, it was not I.\n\nEMILIA. She said so, I must needs report a truth.\n\nOTHELLO. She’s like a liar gone to burning hell, [130]\n\n’Twas I that kill’d her.\n\nEMILIA.    O, the more angel she,\n\nAnd you the blacker devil!\n\nOTHELLO. She turn’d to folly , and she was a whore.\n\nEMILIA. Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.\n\nOTHELLO. She was false as water.\n\nEMILIA.    Thou as rash as fire, [135]\n\nTo say that she was false: O, she was heavenly true!\n\nOTHELLO. Cassio did top her, ask thy husband else;\n\nO, I were damn’d beneath all depth in hell,\n\nBut that I did proceed, upon just grounds,\n\nTo this extremity; thy husband knew it all. [140]\n\nEMILIA. My husband?\n\nOTHELLO. Thy husband.\n\nEMILIA. That she was false to wedlock ?\n\nOTHELLO. Ay, with Cassio: nay, had she been true,\n\nIf heaven would make me such another world, [145]\n\nOf one entire and perfect chrysolite ,\n\nI ’ld not have sold her for it.\n\nEMILIA. My husband?\n\nOTHELLO.    Ay, ’twas he that told me first,\n\nAn honest man he is, and hates the slime\n\nThat sticks on filthy deeds.\n\nEMILIA.    My husband? [150]\n\nOTHELLO. What needs this iteration ? woman, I say thy husband.\n\nEMILIA. O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!\n\nMy husband say that she was false!\n\nOTHELLO.    He, woman;\n\nI say thy husband: dost understand the word?\n\nMy friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago. [155]\n\nEMILIA. If he say so, may his pernicious soul\n\nRot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart,\n\nShe was too fond of her most filthy bargain .\n\nOTHELLO. Ha!\n\nEMILIA. Do thy worst, [160]\n\nThis deed of thine is no more worthy heaven,\n\nThan thou wast  worthy her.\n\nOTHELLO.    Peace, you were best.\n\nEMILIA. Thou hast not half the power to do me harm\n\nAs I have to be hurt: O gull , O dolt ,\n\nAs ignorant as dirt; thou hast done a deed ... [165]\n\nI care not for thy sword, I’ll make thee known,\n\nThough I lost twenty lives: help, help, O help!\n\nThe Moor has kill’d my mistress, murder, murder!\n\n(Enter Montano, Gratiano, Iago, and others.)\n\nMONTANO. What is the matter? How now, general?\n\nEMILIA. O, are you come, Iago? you have done well, [170]\n\nThat men must lay their murders on your neck.\n\nALL. What is the matter?\n\nEMILIA. Disprove this villain, if thou be’st a man;\n\nHe says thou told’st him that his wife was false,\n\nI know thou didst not, thou art not such a villain: [175]\n\nSpeak, for my heart is full.\n\nIAGO. I told him what I thought, and told no more\n\nThan what he found himself was apt and true.\n\nEMILIA. But did you ever tell him she was false?\n\nIAGO. I did. [180]\n\nEMILIA. You told a lie, an odious damned lie;\n\nUpon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie!\n\nShe false with Cassio; did you say with Cassio?\n\nIAGO. With Cassio, mistress; go to, charm your tongue.\n\nEMILIA. I will not charm my tongue, I am bound to speak:\n\nMy mistress here lies murder’d in her bed. [186]\n\nALL. O heavens forfend!\n\nEMILIA. And your reports have set the murder on.\n\nOTHELLO. Nay, stare not, masters, it is true indeed.\n\nGRATIANO. ’Tis a strange truth. [190]\n\nMONTANO. O monstrous act!\n\nEMILIA.    Villainy, villainy, villainy!\n\nI think upon ’t: I think I smell ’t: O villainy!\n\nI thought so then: I’ll kill myself for grief:\n\nO villainy, villainy!\n\nIAGO. What, are you mad? I charge you get you home. [195]\n\nEMILIA. Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak,\n\n’Tis proper I obey him, but not now:\n\nPerchance, Iago, I will ne’er go home.\n\nOTHELLO. O! O! O!\n\n(Falling on the bed.)\n\nEMILIA.    Nay, lay thee down, and roar,\n\nFor thou hast kill’d the sweetest innocent [200]\n\nThat e’er did lift up eye.\n\nOTHELLO (rising). O, she was foul:\n\nI scarce did know you, uncle, there lies your niece,\n\nWhose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp’d;\n\nI know this act shows terrible and grim.\n\nGRATIANO. Poor Desdemona, I am glad thy father’s dead; [205]\n\nThy match was mortal to him, and pure grief\n\n Shore his old thread  atwain : did he live now,\n\nThis sight would make him do a desperate turn,\n\nYea, curse his better angel from his side,\n\nAnd fall to reprobation . [210]\n\nOTHELLO. ’Tis pitiful, but yet Iago knows\n\nThat she with Cassio hath the act of shame\n\nA thousand times committed; Cassio confess’d it,\n\nAnd she did gratify his amorous works ,\n\nWith the recognizance and pledge of love, [215]\n\nWhich I first gave her; I saw it in his hand,\n\nIt was a handkerchief; an antique token\n\nMy father gave my mother.\n\nEMILIA. O God, O heavenly God!\n\nIAGO.    Zounds, hold your peace.\n\nEMILIA. ’Twill out, it will: I hold my peace sir, no, [220]\n\nI’ll be in speaking, liberal as the air,\n\nLet heaven, and men, and devils, let ’em all,\n\nAll, all cry shame against me, yet I’ll speak.\n\nIAGO. Be wise, and get you home.\n\nEMILIA.    I will not.\n\n(Iago offers to stab Emilia.)\n\nGRATIANO.    Fie,\n\nYour sword upon a woman? [225]\n\nEMILIA. O thou dull Moor, that handkerchief thou speak’st on,\n\nI found by fortune, and did give my husband;\n\nFor often with a solemn earnestness,\n\nMore than indeed belong’d to such a trifle,\n\nHe begg’d of me to steal it.\n\nIAGO.    Villainous whore! [230]\n\nEMILIA. She gave it Cassio? no, alas, I found it,\n\nAnd I did give ’t my husband.\n\nIAGO. Filth , thou liest!\n\nEMILIA. By heaven I do not, I do not, gentlemen;\n\nO murderous coxcomb ! what should such a fool\n\nDo with so good a woman?\n\nOTHELLO.    Are there no stones in heaven [235]\n\nBut what serves for the thunder? Precious villain!\n\n(He runs at Iago . )\n\n(Iago stabs Emilia.)\n\nGRATIANO. The woman falls, sure he has kill’d his wife.\n\nEMILIA. Ay, ay, O lay me by my mistress’ side.\n\n(Exit Iago . )\n\nGRATIANO. He’s gone, but his wife’s kill’d.\n\nMONTANO. ’Tis a notorious villain; take you this weapon, [240]\n\nWhich I have here recover’d from the Moor:\n\nCome, guard the door without, let him not pass,\n\nBut kill him rather; I’ll after that same villain,\n\nFor ’tis a damned slave.\n\n(Exeunt Montano and Gratiano.)\n\nOTHELLO.    I am not valiant neither,\n\nBut every puny  whipster gets my sword; [245]\n\nBut why should honour outlive honesty?\n\nLet it go all.\n\nEMILIA.    What did thy song bode, lady?\n\nHark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan ,\n\nAnd die in music: (Singing.) Willow, willow, willow .\n\nMoor, she was chaste, she lov’d thee, cruel Moor, [250]\n\nSo come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;\n\nSo speaking as I think, I die, I die.\n\n(She dies.)\n\nOTHELLO. I have another weapon in this chamber,\n\nIt is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook ’s  temper ;\n\nO, here it is; uncle, I must come forth. [255]\n\nGRATIANO (within). If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear;\n\nThou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.\n\nOTHELLO. Look in upon me then, and speak to me,\n\nOr, naked as I am, I will assault thee.\n\n(Enter Gratiano.)\n\nGRATIANO. What is the matter?\n\nOTHELLO.    Behold, I have a weapon, [260]\n\nA better never did itself sustain\n\nUpon a soldier’s thigh: I have seen the day,\n\nThat with this little arm, and this good sword,\n\nI have made my way through more impediments\n\nThan twenty times your stop: but O vain boast, [265]\n\nWho can control his fate? ’tis not so now.\n\nBe not afraid, though you do see me weapon’d:\n\nHere is my journey’s end, here is my butt ,\n\nAnd very sea-mark of my utmost sail.\n\nDo you go back dismay’d ? ’tis a lost fear: [270]\n\nMan but a rush against Othello’s breast,\n\nAnd he retires. Where should Othello go?\n\nNow: how dost thou look now? O ill-starr’d wench,\n\nPale as thy smock , when we shall meet at count ,\n\nThis look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven, [275]\n\nAnd fiends will snatch at it: cold, cold, my girl,\n\nEven like thy chastity ; O cursed slave!\n\nWhip me, you devils,\n\nFrom the possession of this heavenly sight,\n\nBlow me about in winds, roast me in sulphur, [280]\n\nWash me in steep-down  gulf s of liquid fire!\n\nO Desdemona, Desdemona dead,\n\nOh, oh, oh.\n\n(Enter Lodovico, Montano, Officers with Iago, prisoner, and Cassio in a chair.)\n\nLODOVICO. Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?\n\nOTHELLO. That’s he that was Othello; here I am. [285]\n\nLODOVICO. Where is this viper? bring the villain forth.\n\nOTHELLO. I look down towards his feet, but that’s a fable,\n\nIf that thou be’st a devil, I cannot kill thee.\n\n(Wounds Iago . )\n\nLODOVICO. Wring his sword from him.\n\nIAGO.    I bleed, sir, but not kill’d.\n\nOTHELLO. I am not sorry neither, I ’ld have thee live, [290]\n\nFor in my sense ’tis happiness to die.\n\nLODOVICO. O thou Othello, that wert once so good,\n\nFall’n in the practice of a damned slave,\n\nWhat should be said to thee?\n\nOTHELLO.    Why, anything,\n\nAn honourable murderer, if you will: [295]\n\nFor nought did I in hate, but all in honour.\n\nLODOVICO. This wretch hath part confess’d his villainy:\n\nDid you and he consent in Cassio’s death?\n\nOTHELLO. Ay.\n\nCASSIO. Dear general, I did never give you cause. [300]\n\nOTHELLO. I do believe it, and I ask you pardon;\n\nWill you, I pray, demand that demi-devil\n\nWhy he hath thus ensnar’d my soul and body?\n\nIAGO. Demand me nothing, what you know, you know,\n\nFrom this time forth I never will speak word. [305]\n\nLODOVICO. What, not to pray?\n\nGRATIANO. Torment s will ope your lips.\n\nOTHELLO. Well, thou dost best.\n\nLODOVICO. Sir, you shall understand what hath befall’n,\n\nWhich, as I think, you know not: here is a letter,\n\nFound in the pocket of the slain Roderigo; [310]\n\nAnd here another; the one of them imports\n\nThe death of Cassio; to be undertook\n\nBy Roderigo.\n\nOTHELLO. O villain!\n\nCASSIO.    Most heathenish , and most gross!\n\nLODOVICO. Now here’s another discontented paper, [315]\n\nFound in his pocket too, and this, it seems,\n\nRoderigo meant to have sent this damned villain,\n\nBut that, belike , Iago in the nick\n\nCame in, and satisfied him.\n\nOTHELLO.    O the pernicious caitiff !\n\nHow came you, Cassio, by a handkerchief, [320]\n\nThat was my wife’s?\n\nCASSIO.    I found it in my chamber,\n\nAnd he himself confess’d it even now,\n\nThat there he dropp’d it, for a special purpose,\n\nWhich wrought to his desire.\n\nOTHELLO.    O fool, fool, fool!\n\nCASSIO. There is besides in Roderigo’s letter [325]\n\nHow he upbraid s Iago, that he made him\n\n Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came\n\nThat I was cast ; and even but now he spake,\n\nAfter long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,\n\nIago set him on. [330]\n\nLODOVICO. You must forsake this room, and go with us,\n\nYour power and your command is taken off,\n\nAnd Cassio rules in Cyprus: for this slave,\n\nIf there be any cunning cruelty,\n\nThat can torment him much, and hold him long, [ 335]\n\nIt shall be his: you shall close prisoner rest,\n\nTill that the nature of your fault be known\n\nTo the Venetian state; come, bring him away.\n\nOTHELLO. Soft you, a word or two:\n\nI have done the state some service, and they know ’t; [340]\n\nNo more of that: I pray you in your letters,\n\nWhen you shall these unlucky deeds relate ,\n\nSpeak of them as they are; nothing extenuate ,\n\nNor set down aught in malice; then must you speak\n\nOf one that lov’d not wisely, but too well: [345]\n\nOf one not easily jealous, but being wrought,\n\nPerplex’d in the extreme; of one whose hand,\n\nLike the base Indian , threw a pearl away,\n\nRicher than all his tribe: of one whose subdued eyes,\n\n Albeit unused to the melting mood, [350]\n\nDrops tears as fast as the Arabian trees\n\nTheir medicinal gum ; set you down this,\n\nAnd say besides, that in Aleppo once,\n\nWhere a malignant and a turban’d Turk\n\nBeat a Venetian, and traduc’d the state, [355]\n\nI took by the throat the circumcised dog,\n\nAnd smote him thus.\n\n(Stabs himself.)\n\nLODOVICO. O bloody period!\n\nGRATIANO.    All that’s spoke is marr’d.\n\nOTHELLO. I kiss’d thee ere I kill’d thee, no way but this,\n\nKilling myself, to die upon a kiss. [360]\n\n(Falls on the bed, and dies.)\n\nCASSIO. This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon,\n\nFor he was great of heart.\n\nLODOVICO (to Iago) .    O Spartan dog ,\n\nMore fell than anguish , hunger, or the sea,\n\nLook on the tragic lodging of this bed:\n\nThis is thy work, the object poisons sight, [365]\n\nLet it be hid: Gratiano, keep the house,\n\nAnd seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,\n\nFor they succeed to you: to you, lord governor,\n\nRemains the censure of this hellish villain,\n\nThe time, the place, the torture : O, enforce it! [370]\n\nMyself will straight aboard, and to the state\n\nThis heavy act with heavy heart relate.\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nEditorische Notiz\n\nDer englische Text folgt der Ausgabe: William Shakespeare, Othello , hrsg. von M. R.

Das Stück war ein großer Publikumserfolg und übertraf mit seinen immer wieder angesetzten Aufführungen die anderen großen Tragödien des Autors. Mehr noch: Es regte, zusammen mit Hamlet (1602), so viele Nachahmungen an, dass wir heute zusammenfassend von einer besonderen dramatischen Gattung, der sogenannten ›jakobäischen Rachetragödie‹ sprechen.\n\nDie Hauptrolle fiel zu Shakespeares Lebzeiten seinem Freund und Schauspielerkollegen Richard Burbage zu, der als »grieved Moor« seine Zuschauer offenbar nachhaltig ­beeindruckte. Für Richard Flatters Behauptung, dass kein Geringerer als Shakespeare selbst die Rolle des Iago übernahm – eine sehr verlockende Vermutung –, haben wir allerdings keinen Beleg. Vielmehr scheint diese als Komplementärfigur konzipierte Rolle eher mit John Lowin besetzt gewesen zu sein, der auch in Hamlet (Titelrolle Rich­ard Burbage) eine wichtige Komplementärrolle (Clau­dius) übernahm.\n\nDie einzige das Stück in seiner Gesamtheit verwerfende Kritik stammt aus dem Jahre 1693. Thomas Rymer schrieb damals: »There is in this play some burlesk, some humour and ramble of Comical Wit, some shew and some Mimickry to divert the spectators: but the tragical part is plainly none other than a Bloody Farce, without salt or savour.«\n\nSeit dem 18. Jahrhundert ist Othello hingegen bei Kritikern und Publikum gleichermaßen beliebt, was zweifellos auf die unter den Tragödien Shakespeares einmalig gelungene Verbindung von kompakter Handlung und unerschöpflich erscheinendem Aussagepotenzial zurückzuführen ist. Wie kein anderes Shakespearestück ruft es beim Zuschauer spontane Reaktionen hervor. Iagos Auftritte sind in der Vergangenheit oft mit Zischen, lauten Protesten und gar mit direkten, an Othello gerichteten Warnrufen begleitet worden. Immerhin ist das Publikum heute bereit, die schauspielerische Leistung des Iago-Darstellers am Schluss mit Beifall zu honorieren.\n\nDieser gewandelten Einstellung der Zuschauer entsprechen auch veränderte Inszenierungen und literaturkritische Bewertungen von Othello. Das Stück, so will es scheinen, bedarf keiner Adaptionen wie die anderen Tragödien und ist, mehr als Macbeth und wohl auch Hamlet , eher für die heutige Zeit geschrieben worden. Wir sehen in Othello Bezüge, die Shakespeares Zeitgenossen aufgrund eines völlig anderen Weltbildes entgingen. Und so haben wir in den letzten 100 Jahren Inszenierungen zu verzeichnen, die uns zunächst überraschen, aber vom Text selbst her durchaus begründbar sind. In einer Inszenierung von 1935 wurden die Beziehungen zwischen Othello (Ralph Richardson) und Iago (Laurence Olivier) als homosexuelles Verhältnis interpretiert. Laurence Olivier begegnet uns erneut, dieses Mal als Othello, in einer Inszenierung aus dem Jahre 1964. Hier erscheint Othello – ungemein aktuell – mit karibischem Akzent und Gehabe, während Iago (Frank Finlay) mit seinem nordenglischen Dialekt Provinzialismus, Nonkonformismus und Aufsteigertum suggeriert. Gerade Iagos Rolle lässt eine ungewöhnliche interpretatorische Vielfalt zu, so dass ihr dramatisches Potenzial keineswegs ausgeschöpft ist. Die Literaturkritik hat hier ein erhebliches Maß an Vorleistungen erbracht, deren dramaturgische Umsetzung noch Jahrzehnte dauern wird.\n\nDie erste Textfassung von Othello , eine Quartausgabe (Q1 – 1622), erschien relativ spät, unmittelbar gefolgt von der ersten Gesamtausgabe des Shakespeareschen Werkes (Folio 1 – 1623). Wir wissen nicht, ob der Folio-Text einer anderen Vorlage entnommen wurde. Die Unterschiede sind, verglichen mit anderen Stücken, nicht sehr groß. In der Folio-Fassung finden wir weniger Flüche, offenbar eine Konzession an ein Gesetz aus dem Jahre 1606, welches dem Theater entsprechende Auflagen machte. Außerdem ist der Folio-Text insgesamt 160 Zeilen länger als die erste Quartausgabe, die interessanterweise mehr Bühnenanweisungen enthält. Eine weitere Quartausgabe (Q2) liegt aus dem Jahr 1630 vor. Hier sind die jeweils fehlenden Elemente der vorhergehenden Ausgabe einbezogen worden. Die Tatsache, dass Othello zu einer Zeit, als das Theater nur noch eine geringe Bedeutung hatte, noch einmal als Einzeltext aufgelegt wurde, spricht für das ungebrochene Ansehen des Stückes.\n\nMit der Wahl eines venezianischen Stoffes traf Shake­speare erneut den zeitgenössischen Publikumsgeschmack. Bereits 1596/97 hatte er im Merchant of Venice mit geographisch und soziologisch interessanten Dimensionen experimentiert, die auch in Othello wieder auftauchen. In beiden Stücken ist der wegen seiner Exotik faszinierende Handlungsort durch einen Außenstehenden mit einem besonderen Spannungsverhältnis versehen worden. Venedig, über dessen politische Verfassung Shakespeare sich vermutlich in Kardinal Contarinis Commonwealth and Government informierte, ist offenbar auf den Bankier ­Shylock und noch mehr auf den Berufssoldaten Othello ­angewiesen. Trotzdem ist die Republik keine offene Gesellschaft, weder für den Juden Shylock, der die Integration nicht sucht, noch für den ›Mohren‹ Othello, der sein militärisches Renommee mit Gleichberechtigung verwechselt.\n\nVenedig genoss im England des 16. und 17. Jahrhunderts ein wegen seiner freistaatlichen Verfassung, der in seinem Herrschaftsbereich garantierten religiösen Toleranz, wegen seiner ausgedehnten Handelsbeziehungen und nicht zuletzt wegen seines permanenten Abwehrkampfes gegen die Türken hohes Ansehen. Gleichzeitig war Venedig auch ein Teil jenes Italienbildes, das sich vom 16. zum 17. Jahrhundert zunehmend verdunkelte. Der in den Komödien vermittelte Eindruck von Schönheit, Lebensfreude und höherer Kultur wurde nach und nach von einem anderen Klischeebild verdrängt, welches sich zuweilen auch vorher schon manifestiert hatte. Dieses Italien war das Land des Macchiavellismus, der Intrige, der politischen und moralischen Korruption, des teuflisch erscheinenden Papsttums und der Destruktion aus Motiven, die sich einer einfachen Begründung entziehen.\n\nShakespeares Quelle war eine 1566 in Venedig von Giovanni Battista Giraldo Cinthio unter dem Titel Hecatommithi veröffentlichte Sammlung von Geschichten, deren Weg nur bis Frankreich belegt ist. Gegen die Vermutung, dass Shakespeare eine englische Übersetzung zur Verfügung hatte, spricht die Tatsache, dass sein Text weniger wörtlich mit der Vorlage übereinstimmt, als dies etwa bei den Historien oder Römerdramen der Fall ist.\n\nCinthios Geschichte wurde von Shakespeare erheblich verändert und auch erweitert. Die in der Vorlage angege­benen Motive und Handlungsstränge sind einfach und direkt; sie sollten jedoch auch dort nicht übergangen werden, wo Shakespeares Text offenkundig von ihnen abweicht. Dieser Hinweis gilt insbesondere für die Frage nach Iagos Motiven.\n\nIn Cinthios Novelle ist der Fähnrich (Shakespeares Iago) in Disdemona (sic!) verliebt, kann sie aber aus Angst vor dem ›Mohren‹ (der bei Cinthio namenlos bleibt) nicht unmittelbar ansprechen. Disdemona nimmt keine Notiz von seinen vorsichtigen Annäherungsversuchen, woraufhin der Fähnrich vermutet, dass sie statt seiner Person den Hauptmann (Shakespeares Cassio) liebt. Der Fähnrich sinnt auf Rache. Der Hauptmann soll sterben, und, wenn ihm, dem Fähnrich, Disdemona verwehrt ist, soll auch der Mohr sie verlieren. Als der Hauptmann wegen eines Disziplinarverfahrens degradiert wird, setzt sich Disdemona ihrem Gatten gegenüber allzu nachdrücklich für ihn ein. Der Mohr erzählt dem Fähnrich von diesem Übereifer seiner Frau und bringt ihn damit auf den eigentlichen Rachegedanken. Mit Suggestivfragen weckt der Fähnrich den Argwohn des Mohren. Später unterstellt er Disdemona eine rassisch bedingte Abscheu vor ihrem Gatten, eine Verdächtigung, die den Mohren vollends aus dem Gleichgewicht geraten lässt. Zunächst ist jedoch der Fähnrich selbst in Gefahr. Der Mohr droht ihm ein böses Ende an für den Fall, dass die aufgestellten Behauptungen nicht zutreffen. Er verlangt einen sichtbaren Beweis für Disdemonas Untreue. Mit Hilfe seiner dreijährigen Tochter gelingt es dem Fähnrich, Disdemonas Taschentuch, ein wertvolles Geschenk des Mohren, zu entwenden und in den Besitz des Hauptmanns zu bringen. Als der Mohr das Taschentuch, nachdem er Disdemona vergeblich danach gefragt hatte, unter geschickter Anleitung des Fähnrichs im Haus des Hauptmanns sieht, ist für ihn der geforderte Beweis erbracht. Er bittet den Fähnrich, den Hauptmann zu töten. Der weisungsgemäß eingeleitete Anschlag gelingt jedoch nur zum Teil. Disdemona wird sodann vom Mohren und dem Fähnrich gemeinsam mit einem sandgefüllten Strumpf erschlagen. Der Mord wird anschließend durch Zerstörung des Hauses verdeckt. Nach der Tat ist der Mohr so sehr von Kummer geplagt, dass er nunmehr den Fähnrich zu hassen beginnt. Er enthebt ihn seiner Funktionen. Dieser rächt sich, indem er den – überlebenden – Hauptmann zu einem Gerichtsverfahren gegen den Mohren anstachelt. Der Mohr gesteht schließlich unter der Folter seine Tat. Er wird lebenslänglich aus Venedig verbannt und von Disdemonas Verwandten getötet. Der Fähnrich entgeht zunächst seiner Bestrafung und kann eine Zeitlang weitere Opfer verfolgen, wird letztlich aber auch festgenommen und stirbt unter der Folter.\n\nDie zentralen Handlungsepisoden der Novelle von Cinthio, in denen die Verführung des Mohren durch seinen Fähnrich dargestellt wird, entsprechen teilweise sehr genau der Handlung in Shakespeares Tragödie. Für den ersten und den letzten Akt finden wir hingegen nur wenige Parallelen in der Quelle.\n\nDie von Shakespeare erdachten Namen von zwei Prot­agonisten sind bezeichnenderweise nicht mit Italien, sondern mit Spanien assoziiert. Iago (Santiago – der Heilige Jakob) hatte als spanischer Nationalheiliger und als Bezugs­figur für die mehrere Jahrhunderte dauernde Reconquista den Beinamen »Matamoros« (›Mohren‹- oder ›Mauren­töter‹), während der Name Roderigo sowohl an den letzten Westgotenkönig Roderich als auch an den spanischen Na­tionalhelden des Mittelalters Roderigo Diaz (El Cid) er­innert.\n\nDer Name der Titelfigur ist hingegen keiner historischen Gestalt zuzuordnen. »Othello« ist eine italienische Diminutivform von »Otho«, einem römischen Kaiser, dessen Büste eine Abteilung der Cottonian Library ziert und Kennern der mittelenglischen Literatur noch heute als Orientierungshilfe dient. Diese in London aufbewahrte wert­volle Sammlung alter Handschriften aus den Beständen aufgelöster Klöster war zur Shakespearezeit bekannt. Ein direkter Bezug zu Shakespeare ist jedoch bislang nicht nachgewiesen worden.\n\nDie erste Szene von Shakespeares Othello ist eine typische Expositionsszene, in der der Titelheld zunächst nicht auftritt. Stattdessen sehen wir zwei Figuren, den Aristokraten Roderigo und den Fähnrich Iago, den wir weder hier noch später im Stück definitiv einer bestimmten Stufe in der gesellschaftlichen Hierarchie zuordnen können. Iago führt sich mit einem vulgären Fluch (»’Sblood«) ein, der sich deutlich von Roderigos fast höflichem »Tush« abhebt. Iago kann es sich offenbar erlauben, Roderigo in rüder Weise zu antworten. Wir merken sehr bald, dass Roderigo ein Tölpel ist, der sich von Iago missbrauchen und ausbeuten lässt. Zu Iagos Eigenschaften gehört unter anderem ein handfester materieller Erwerbstrieb, der die Veruntreuung der ihm von Roderigo für Desdemona überlassenen Werte einschließt. Iago ist Ökonom. Er sorgt nicht nur für sich selbst und gebraucht sehr häufig kommerzielle Termini (»sell«, »buy«, »profit«, »dear«, »purse«, »enrich«, »jewels«, »gold«), sondern berät am Ende von Akt I auch Roderigo für das kommende Unternehmen (»put money enough in your purse«).\n\nIagos Erwerbstrieb war für Shakespeares Zeitgenossen ebenso vulgär und verdächtig wie sein von ihm selbst vorgebrachtes Aufstiegsmotiv. Für viele Kritiker ist Iagos Enttäuschung darüber, dass er bei der Ernennung des stellvertretenden Befehlshabers zu Unrecht übergangen worden sei, nur ein Ad-hoc-Argument zur Beschwichtigung Roderigos. Bradleys Warnung, keiner Aussage Iagos Glauben zu schenken, solange sie nicht durch Tatsachen oder Wiederholungen gedeckt sei, hat viele Kritiker dazu verleitet, Iagos Motive auf einige wenige zu reduzieren. Ist deshalb das von ihm selbst vorgetragene Aufstiegsmotiv nicht echt, zumal er selbst nur einmal kurz (I,3,392) und zweimal eher indirekt (II,1,174 und 277) darauf zurückkommt, und außerdem niemand auf seine Enttäuschung eingeht? Letzterem wäre entgegenzuhalten, dass Iago als Person für alle anderen Figuren bezeichnenderweise uninteressant ist. Dies entspricht der traditionellen dramatischen Konvention, derzufolge nur Personen höheren Standes als Charaktere von Interesse sind. Zu dieser Gruppe rechnet Iago zweifellos nicht, wie die Kritiker einhellig feststellen. Wir erfahren nichts über seine Herkunft, und er ist ganz sicher nicht der Typ des degenerierten Aristokraten, den wir in Falstaff erkennen. Die Stellung seiner Frau Emilia ist ebenfalls nicht genau definiert, doch erscheint sie uns eher als Bedienstete Desdemonas denn als auch nur annähernd gleichberechtigte Figur. Über Iagos Bildung erfahren wir indirekt etwas in seiner ersten Rede. Für den erfolgreichen Florentiner Cassio hat er nur Verachtung übrig, denn dieser hat ihm offenbar einiges an theoretischer Bildung (»book­ish theoric«) voraus, während Iago für sich Erfahrung und Praxis reklamiert. Doch ist es nicht nur Bildungsneid, den Iago für den Aristokraten Cassio empfindet. Es ist ein grober Klassenhass, der den Lebensstil der Aristokratie und die von ihr gesetzten ästhetischen Normen als anstößig empfindet. Iago hat Cassio gegenüber Minderwertigkeitskomplexe. Wenn er ihn als »proper man« bezeichnet, so ist dies vordergründig ironisch, aber gleichzeitig auch Ausdruck seines Neides. Noch deutlicher ist Iagos expliziter Vergleich in Akt V:\n\n»He has a daily beauty in his life,\n\nThat makes me ugly: […]« (V,1,19 f.).\n\nIagos Hass auf das Schöne ist ebenso wie sein Aufstiegsmotiv Ausdruck seines diabolischen Charakters, denn geläufiger Auffassung zufolge konnte nur der Teufel ein Interesse an der Zerstörung der Ordnung, die sich als Schönheit manifestierte, haben.\n\nBei seinem ersten Auftritt kann sich Iago mehr Ehrlichkeit erlauben als später, denn er hat nur den tölpelhaften Roderigo vor sich. Diese von Shakespeare eigens geschaffene Figur erfüllt im übrigen fast ausschließlich einen dra­matischen Zweck. An ihr kann Iago dem Zuschauer gegenüber seine Manipulationskünste vorführen, und sie dient gleichzeitig zur Steigerung der Spannung, denn Iago erweist sich bald als allzu selbstsicherer Schurke. Roderigo schöpft nach und nach Verdacht und muss schließlich von Iago kaltblütig ermordet werden. Seine dramatische Funktion wird sodann von Emilia übernommen. Sie, Iagos Frau, ist es, die am Schluss die Intrige erkennt und mutig aufdeckt. Iago täuscht sich mithin bei Figuren, die er nicht ernst nimmt.\n\nEin weiteres Motiv für Iagos Handeln glaubt etwa Elliott bereits in seiner ersten Aussage zu erkennen. Im Gegensatz zu Cassio ist Iago von Othellos Heirat ebenso überrascht worden wie Roderigo und – so Elliott – dadurch zutiefst gekränkt worden. Das Argument ist, auf sich gestellt und nur auf diese und eine weitere Stelle (I,2,20) bezogen, kaum überzeugend und vermag nur dann sinnvoll zu erscheinen, wenn wir, wie die bereits erwähnte Inszenierung aus den dreißiger Jahren, ein homosexuelles Verhältnis zwischen Othello und Iago unterstellen. Eine von Heilman zitierte psychoanalytische Deutung des Stückes geht davon aus, dass Iago für Desdemona besonders intensive Hassgefühle empfindet, weil sie ihm nicht nur Othello, sondern auch Cassio streitig macht.\n\nIagos erste längere Rede endet mit seinem bekanntesten Ausspruch: »I am not what I am« (I,1,65). Von dieser Stelle an weiß der Zuschauer, dass Iagos wahre Identität für seine Umwelt verborgen bleibt. Iago ist Schauspieler. Eines seiner Lieblingswörter ist »show«. In einem der für ihn typischen Selbstgespräche, die gleichermaßen für die Zuschauer wie für ihn selbst bestimmt sind, spricht er gar von »heavenly shows« (II,3,345). Wir haben in diesem Stück mehr als das bei Shakespeare häufige ›Theater im Theater‹, das primär an andere Figuren des jeweiligen Stückes adressiert ist. Allerdings ist es nicht so, dass Iago seine Opfer einfach von seinem selbst inszenierten Drama ausschließt. Im Gegenteil: Er fordert Othello immer wieder auf, zu ›sehen‹, ein bereits in Cinthios Novelle ansatzweise vorhandenes Element. W. H. Auden sieht Iago als ›Joker in the Pack‹, als eine Figur mithin, die die anderen Figuren mit immer neuen Streichen übertrumpft und durch den Erfolg vom groben Streich bis hin zum Kapitalverbrechen getragen wird. Iagos wiederholter Ausruf »Is ’t possible?« ist Ausdruck dieses Vergnügens an den Leiden der von ihm düpierten Mitspieler. Doch ist Iago mehr als ein bösartig veranlagter Spaßvogel, der von Erfolg zu Erfolg taumelt. Er ist ein Meister der Schauspielkunst, der sich an seinem eigenen Können berauscht. Der Aufstieg, der ihm in der realen Gesellschaft mit ihren starren Konventionen notwendigerweise versagt blieb, ist ihm umso mehr in seiner dramatischen Welt möglich. Hier kann er sein ›vereiteltes Überlegenheitsgefühl‹ (Bradley) befriedigen und sein ›rasendes Verlangen nach Selbsterhöhung‹ (Flatter) stillen. ­Iagos Selbstgespräche sind nicht die reflektierenden Monologe eines Hamlet, sie sind jedoch mehr als dramatisch funktionale Hinweise für die Zuschauer. Iago kann sich hier selbst bewundern: Iago als Narziss.\n\nIagos Schauspielkunst wird bereits in der Expositionsszene deutlich. Er kann sich auf sein Gegenüber einstellen und so seine Gesprächspartner leicht für sich gewinnen. Gegenüber Roderigo kann er sich sogar sehr bald die mokante Anrede »sir« erlauben, ohne dass dieser die Ironie bemerkt. In der Verführungsszene (III,3) treibt Iago Othello gegenüber die der eigenen Belustigung dienende Imitation seines Gesprächspartners so weit, dass selbst Othello es bemerkt.\n\nIago ist nicht nur Schauspieler, sondern auch Regisseur. Er ist es, der die Tragödie Othello inszeniert und dabei seine Regie für den Zuschauer – und für sich selbst – nach und nach entwickelt und verfeinert. Nur wissen seine Akteure nichts von den ihnen zugedachten Rollen. Neben Handlungen, die aufgrund der vorgegebenen Umstände von selbst ablaufen, weist dieses Stück Episoden auf, bei denen Iago als Regisseur eingreifen muss. In der Täuschungsszene (IV,1) arrangiert er den Handlungsablauf so, dass für den eigens geladenen Zuschauer Othello der sichtbare Beweis für Desdemonas Untreue erbracht ist. Die anderen Regieszenen sind nächtliche Unruheszenen, von der Radauszene vor Brabantios Haus (I,1) über die Unruheszene auf Zypern (II,3) bis hin zur blutigen Überfallszene (V,1). Bei allen drei Szenen muss der Regisseur Iago kräftig nachhelfen, um den gewünschten Effekt zu erzielen.\n\nWarum hasst Iago Othello? Dass er ihn hasst, kann wohl kaum bezweifelt werden. Wir erfahren bereits davon in seinem ersten Gespräch mit Roderigo, und Iago bekräftigt diesen Hass mit einer deutlichen Emphase am Ende des ersten Aktes. Wieder ist es Roderigo, dem er sich freimütig offenbart:\n\n»I have told thee often, and I tell thee again, and again, I hate the Moor; my cause is hearted«\n\n (I,3,364–366).\n\nAls Iago dann allein ist, spricht er am Anfang seines ersten großen Monologs dieselben Worte aus, allerdings mit einer kaum glaubhaft erscheinenden Begründung:\n\n»[…] I hate the Moor,\n\nAnd it is thought abroad, that ’twixt my sheets\n\nHe’s done my office; I know not if ’t be true …\n\nYet I, for mere suspicion in that kind,\n\nWill do, as if for surety« (I,3,385–389).\n\nDem aufmerksamen Leser wird die hier merkwürdig erscheinende Standardkonjunktion »and« aufgefallen sein. Iagos Intellekt arbeitet assoziativ. Der – vielleicht allzu freimütigen – Selbstoffenbarung folgt eine deutlich impro­visierte Begründung. Sie taucht als ausdrückliches Rachemotiv Iagos noch einmal auf (II,1,290–294). Ist sie deshalb weniger glaubhaft? Das Stück bietet keinen Anhaltspunkt für eine tatsächliche außereheliche Beziehung zwischen Othello und Emilia. Die Kritik betont zudem Iagos große Menschenkenntnis als Argument dafür, dass er mit diesem Verdacht nur ein Pseudoargument vorbrachte. Außerdem, so lesen wir bei mehreren Kritikern, müsste sich Iagos Rache ebenso gegen Emilia richten. Bei objektiver Betrachtung ist der Verdacht somit für Iago ein Motiv, das ihm zufällig einfiel, als er für seinen Hass eine Begründung suchte. Seit Coleridge spricht die Kritik treffend von ›motive hunting‹ als einem wesentlichen Charakterzug Iagos. Iago ist demnach auf der Suche nach Motiven für sein eigenes Handeln. Seine Einfälle wachsen allerdings über ihren anfänglichen Pseudocharakter hinaus, wie die zweite Stelle deutlich zeigt:\n\n»For that I do suspect the lustful Moor\n\nHath leap’d into my seat, the thought whereof\n\nDoth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards,\n\nAnd nothing can, nor shall content my soul,\n\nTill I am even with him, wife, for wife« (II,1, 292–296).\n\nIago hat inzwischen vergessen, dass dieses Motiv ursprünglich nur ein willkommener Einfall war und ihm eine vordergründige Motivation für seinen Hass lieferte. Aus dem ›bloßen‹, nicht ernstgenommenen Verdacht ist nunmehr eine quälende Besessenheit geworden, die ihm den Weg der Rache zwingend vorschreibt. Iago ist somit nicht einfach der rational-zynische, alles kaltblütig ­planende und ausführende Bösewicht, als der er vor allem in der älteren Kritik dargestellt wird, sondern ein aus­gesprochen schizoider Charakter. Er lebt in zwei Welten, der von ihm objektiv wahrgenommenen realen Umwelt und in einer von ihm selbst gestalteten illusorisch-thea­tralischen Welt, in die hinein er nicht nur andere dank ­seiner suggestiven Fähigkeiten zu zerren vermag. Auch er wird Opfer seiner Suggestion: Iago als Selbst-Verführer.\n\nIn Cinthios Novelle ist ein eifersüchtiges Verlangen nach Desdemona der Grund, der das Vorgehen des Fähnrichs zunächst bestimmt. Wenn wir der großen Mehrheit der Kritiker folgen, so scheidet dieses Motiv für Shakespeares Fähnrich Iago völlig aus. Bei genauerer Betrachtung seiner eigenen Aussagen erweist sich jedoch, dass Cinthios Geschichte nicht so sehr verändert als vielmehr erweitert worden ist. Wiederum ist es die Form der Aussage, die uns eine besondere Aufmerksamkeit abverlangt. In einem längeren assoziativen Monolog am Ende der ersten Szene von Akt II stellt Iago die erotischen Beziehungen zwischen den Hauptfiguren dar. Cassio, so glaubt er, liebt Desdemona; der Mohr wird sich als treuer Gemahl erweisen. Iago fährt dann fort:\n\n»[…] now I do love her too,\n\nNot out of absolute lust, (though peradventure\n\nI stand accountant for as great a sin)\n\nBut partly led to diet my revenge« (II,1,288–291).\n\nWieder sind es die Übergänge zwischen den von Iago ­vorgetragenen Äußerungen, die uns als besonders signi­fikant erscheinen. Iago argumentiert nicht mit logischer Konsequenz, sondern assoziativ improvisierend. Der ­Ausspruch »now I do love her too« will uns gerade deshalb als echte Selbstentlarvung erscheinen, weil er von schwachen, zusammenhanglosen Begründungen gefolgt wird. Die Kommata und die eine gedankliche Parenthese anzeigenden Klammern sind Indiz für Iagos Oszillieren zwischen einem Selbstentlarvungsdrang und abschwächend-verdeckenden Begründungen: Iago als frustrierter Liebhaber. Weitere Belege für seine Liebe zu Desdemona lassen sich unschwer in dem geistreichen Dialog dieser beiden Figuren zu Beginn eben dieser Szene finden. Iagos Antworten sind durchweg mit sexuellen Konnotationen befrachtet. Desdemona nennt ihn abschließend Cassio gegenüber »a most profane and liberal counsellor« (II,1,163 f.). Iagos obszöne Zweideutigkeiten werden daraufhin von Cassio als die einfache Sprache des Ungebildeten entschuldigt. Ob Iago diese Kränkung hört, wissen wir nicht, denn er ist mittlerweile mit etwas anderem beschäftigt. Hasserfüllt beobachtet und kommentiert er die zwischen Cassio und Desdemona ausgetauschten Höflichkeiten. Seine Eifersucht lässt ihn zunächst nur an Rache denken, womit wir erneut an Cinthios Novelle erinnert werden. Dann jedoch gelangen Elemente seines von einer brutalen Sexualität geprägten Unterbewusstseins an die Oberfläche. Es ist bezeichnend für das Ausmaß seiner sexuellen Erregung, dass er die durch Othellos Auftritt unterbrochene sexuelle Thematik im Beisein Roderigos wieder aufnimmt. Hier argumentiert er zunächst mit sexualpsychologischer Nüchternheit, steigert sich dann jedoch zu neurotischen Zwangs­vorstellungen, um sich schließlich mit Abscheu davon zu distanzieren.\n\nWährend Roderigo von Iagos Sexualdiagnosen und Zwangsneurosen unbeeindruckt bleibt, ist Othello nicht gegen sexuelle Suggestionen gefeit. Bei seiner Verführung arbeitet Iago mit Suggestivfragen, die in zunehmendem Maße mit konkreten Vorstellungen angereichert werden. In der ersten Szene des vierten Aktes verliert Othello nach einer erneuten sexuell suggestiven Aussage Iagos über Desdemonas angebliches Verhältnis zu Cassio vollends das Gleichgewicht. Auch Jagos Sadismus ist immer mit sexuellen Konnotationen befrachtet. Es ist wohl nicht verfehlt, seine sexuell-sadistischen Phantastereien und Handlungen als Ausdruck einer Ersatzbefriedigung zu deuten, deren er als frustrierter Liebhaber bedarf. Auch sollte der Stellenwert dieses Motivs nicht zu gering veranschlagt werden, denn Iago stellt sich bereits in der ersten Szene des Stückes damit vor. Er ist es, der Brabantio mit sexuell-sadistischen Grobheiten um seinen Schlaf bringt, und er ist es, der hier und in II,1 als Unruhestifter die Liebesnacht zwischen Othello und Desdemona stört.\n\nZwischen Iagos sexueller Besessenheit als Symptom einer moralischen Korruption sowie seinem Einsatz sexueller Suggestionen zur Verführung Unschuldiger einerseits und der Schlangenmetaphorik des Stückes andererseits bestehen deutliche Bezüge. Emilia spricht im vierten Akt hypothetisch von »serpent’s curse« (IV,2,16), und Lodovico ruft am Ende nach dem Urheber des Unheils mit den Worten »Where is this viper?« (V,2,286). Othello selbst hatte bereits in seiner Beschwörung des Hasses von »aspics’ tongues« (III,3,457) gesprochen: die Giftschlange Iago als Werkzeug des Teufels.\n\nIn der ihrer Ordnung beraubten Welt von Othello wird Gift zum Heilmittel und Iago zum Arzt. Nach Othellos Anfall in IV,1 bemühen sich Cassio und Iago um ihn. Während Cassio nur elementare Sanitäterdienste anbieten kann, stellt Iago eine scheinbar fundierte Diagnose. Andere Fi­guren, Cassio, Roderigo und Bianca, werden von ihm ebenfalls diagnostiziert, wie auch seine Beschreibung und Erklärung heterosexueller Beziehungen zunächst durch klinisch-rationale Nüchternheit gekennzeichnet ist. Es steigert die Tragik des Stückes, dass Dr. Iago nicht nur Othello zu seinen Patienten zählt, sondern auch Desdemona. Sie wendet sich in IV,2 verzweifelt an ihn und wird von ihm wie von einem Arzt beschwichtigt.\n\nAls Typ hat Iago bestimmte dramatische Vorläufer. Da sind einmal die schablonenhaften Figuren »Devil« des Mystery Play und »Vice« des Morality Play. Zum anderen entdecken wir Anleihen beim macchiavellistischen Schurken, wie er uns etwa in Marlowes Jew of Malta begegnet. Als Inkarnation des Bösen ist Iago viel komplexer als seine Vorgänger; in seiner dramatischen Funktion als Bezugsperson ist er jedoch eng an das letztgenannte Vorbild angelehnt. Die eingangs erwähnte neue Gattung der ›jakobäischen Rachetragödie‹ kennt ebenfalls den macchiavellistischen Schurken, der sich und seine Intrigen dem Publikum offenbart. In Shakespeares eigenem Werk ist der macchiavellistische Typ deutlicher bei Richard III und Edmund (in King Lear ) ausgeprägt, denn beide streben nach politischer Macht und beide haben eine Philosophie. Iago hingegen hat nur die ›Philosophie eines Krokodils‹ (Flatter), das darauf bedacht ist, alles Höherstehende zu sich herabzuziehen. Es ist ein besonderes Merkmal dieser Tragödie von Shake­speare, dass sie philosophisch kaum etwas zu bieten hat. Während die Titelfigur geistig anspruchslos ist, hat die Figur des die Ordnung nachhaltig störenden Schurken nur eine zynisch-materialistische Lebensphilosophie vorzuweisen, durch die die etablierten Normen nicht ernsthaft in Frage gestellt werden. Der philosophischen Durchdringung der anderen Tragödien entspricht hier eine umso größere psychologische Tiefe, insbesondere in der Figur Iagos. Zwei Epitheta sind es, die uns bei dieser Figur besonders auffallen. Wie Heilman feststellt, hat Shakespeare die Bezeichnung »slave« fast ausschließlich für Iago reserviert. Das relativ häufige Vorkommen des Wortes lässt den Schluss zu, dass Shakespeare dabei nicht nur das damals geläufige Schimpfwort (›gemeiner Kerl, Hund‹) einsetzen wollte, sondern auch den weiteren konnotativen Bereich (Sklave = Mensch außer- und unterhalb der bestehenden Gesellschaft) einbezog. Die Juxtaposition »honest Iago« fiel bereits Shakespeares Zeitgenossen auf, was kaum verwunderlich ist, denn »honest« kommt mehr als fünfzigmal vor. Es ist kaum denkbar, dass Shakespeare »honest« rein denotativ verstanden wissen wollte. Vordergründig ist zweifellos die denotative Bedeutung ›ehrlich‹ gemeint, denn die Juxtaposition kommt vorzugsweise dort vor, wo Täuschung und Selbsttäuschung besonders offenkundig sind. Vor allem ist es Othello, der im Augenblick des Getäuschtwerdens besonders nachdrücklich seinen Glauben an Iagos Ehrlichkeit zum Ausdruck bringt:\n\n»Iago is most honest« (II,3,6),\n\n»And for I know thou art full of love and honesty«\n\n (III,3,122),\n\n»My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago«\n\n (V,2,155).\n\nIago gelingt es, den mit dem Wort »honest« verbundenen Respekt für sich allein zu beanspruchen und Desdemona durch Infragestellung und Verweigerung eben dieses Attributs ins Zwielicht zu rücken. Spätestens seit Empsons Beitrag wissen wir aber auch, dass »honest« zur Shakespearezeit ein im Bedeutungswandel begriffenes Wort war und dabei auf einem neuen, von den Konventionen befreiten Ehrbegriff basierte. Gleichzeitig – und das erscheint uns bei der Frage nach Iagos Motiven besonders aufschlussreich – wurde »honest« vielfach herablassend gebraucht und implizierte dabei eine gesellschaftliche Beleidigung des Tieferstehenden sowie einen Hinweis auf dessen unzureichende Bildung. Wenn Iago mithin derart häufig, wenngleich unbeabsichtigt, von Othello und anderen Figuren beleidigt wird, erscheint uns das zuvor erwähnte Motiv des Klassenhasses um einen Beleg reicher.\n\nAuch wenn einige Kritiker, insbesondere F. R. Leavis, Motivationsanalysen für unangebracht halten und in Iago nicht mehr als einen dramatisch gelungenen Schurkentyp sehen, so lassen sich Iagos Motive nicht einfach auf grobe Klischees wie ›Werkzeug des Teufels‹ oder ›Inkarnation des Bösen‹ reduzieren. Ein Iago-Darsteller hat deshalb große Schwierigkeiten, will er mehr als nur einen Teil des reichhaltigen Motivkatalogs dieser Figur dramatisch umsetzen. Vielleicht kommt man Iagos Charakter näher, wenn man eine von Bradley eher nebenbei geäußerte These weiter verfolgt: die Tragödie Othello auch als Tragödie Iagos.\n\nDie Tragik des Titelhelden ist, weitaus mehr als bei anderen tragischen Helden Shakespeares, a priori in seiner ­eigenen Person angelegt. Als Vertreter einer anderen Rasse steht Othello von Anfang an in einem Spannungsverhältnis zur venezianischen Normgesellschaft. In jenem ­anderen venezianischen Stück, in The Merchant of Venice , hatte Shakespeare bereits eine exotische Figur, Morocco, auf die Bühne gestellt. Das Gefälle zwischen weißer Normgesellschaft und exotischem Eindringling diente hier nur der Komik, konnte aber auch, wie Cinthios Novelle bereits zeigte, zur Darstellung tragischer Konflikte genutzt werden. Seit der Romantik wurde Shakespeares noble moor vielfach als Nordafrikaner dargestellt, um seine Distanz zur Normgesellschaft zu verkürzen. Vermutlich wurde Shake­speare durch das Erscheinungsbild und das Auftreten einer ­marokkanischen Delegation und ihres Anführers Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud angeregt. Diese diplomatische Mission weilte in der zweiten Hälfte des Jahres 1600 am englischen Hof, um eine Allianz gegen den gemeinsamen Feind Spanien zu schmieden. Shakespeares Truppe, die Lord Chamberlain’s Men, trat während dieser Zeit ebenfalls am Hofe auf. Es ist kaum anzunehmen, dass Shake­speare die Besucher nicht wahrgenommen hat.\n  \n![019882_Abb01.jpg](image/019882_Abb01_fmt.png)\n  \nAbd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud ben Mohammed Anoun, 1600/01 Botschafter Marokkos am Hofe Königin Elizabeth I.\n  \n\n\nDie den literarischen Text historistisch verzerrende romantische Sichtweise ist allerdings wieder aufgegeben worden. Shakespeares Othello ist eindeutig negroid, nennt Roderigo ihn doch gleich zu Beginn des Stückes »the thicklips«. Vermutlich machte Shakespeare bei Plinius ( Naturalis Historia, übersetzt von Philemon Holland) Anleihen für die Charakterisierung seiner Titelfigur. Othello ist im übrigen auch aus poetischen Gründen schwarz. Das Stück ist mit einer ausgeprägten Schwarzweißmetaphorik versehen, die uns insbesondere in Iagos geistreichem Zwiegespräch mit Desdemona in II,1 auffällt. Während die venezianische Aristokratie nur dann ihre rassistischen Vorurteile zugibt, wenn sie sich, wie Brabantio, geschädigt fühlt, artikuliert Iago gleich zu Beginn der Tragödie ein obszönes Konglomerat aus Rassismus, Sadismus und Sexualität. Wir können im nachhinein Iagos Motive für seinen Hass auf Othello um das der rassistischen Voreingenommenheit ergänzen.\n\nOthellos erster Auftritt widerlegt völlig das von Iago suggerierte Negativbild. Sein souveräner Umgang mit Brabantio und dem Dogen lässt uns die Möglichkeit eines tragischen Endes zunächst vergessen. Othello hat zu Beginn des Stückes die realen Höhepunkte seines Lebens erreicht, Desdemona und eine totale militärische Befehlsgewalt. Die Republik Venedig hat ihr Schicksal in seine Hände gelegt. Wir erfahren mehrfach aus Iagos Mund, dass Othello ein edler Charakter ist. Allerdings hat Iago schon eine schwache Stelle entdeckt: Der Mohr ist allzu leichtgläubig. Die Kritik hält Othello für dumm, ungebildet, simpel, naiv und stumpfsinnig, um nur einige Attribute zu zitieren. Die Tragik des Helden liegt mithin in seinem Unvermögen, die reale Welt zu begreifen, begründet. Wird Othello dadurch zur heroischen Figur? Hier gehen die Ansichten der Kritiker weit auseinander. Ausgehend von Cassios Ausspruch »he was great of heart« (V,2,362) unmittelbar nach Othellos Tod, gelangt Flatter gar zu dem Urteil, dass Othellos Ende nicht Elend, Niederlage oder Strafe, sondern ein Sieg sei. Mehr noch: Othello stirbt, so Flatter, den edelsten Tod unter Shakespeares Helden. Bradley hält Othello für den romantischsten aller Shakespeare-Helden, meint damit jedoch eher die Ästhetik der Titelfiguren. Othellos Erscheinung und seine Sprache heben ihn durch ihre Exotik und ihre Poesie deutlich von der Umwelt ab. Was T. S. Eliot für Othellos letzte Rede feststellte, eine bewusste ästhetische Selbstisolierung Othellos gegenüber der Umwelt, mag auch für die ersten Auftritte gelten. Es ist bezeichnend für den anfälligen, von Iago zunehmend infizierten Helden des Stückes, dass er im dritten und vierten Akt zeitweilig die Sprache seines Verführers annimmt, diese dann jedoch dank seiner größeren poetischen Veranlagung noch zu steigern vermag. Othellos sexuell-sadistische Zwangsneurosen übertreffen Iagos Wahnvorstellungen in ihrer Brutalität. In der Mordszene (V,2) hingegen entspricht Othellos Sprache wieder dem, was die Kritik als seine Poesie besonders hervorhebt.\n\nEine Othello eher negativ bewertende Interpretations­linie können wir etwa bei Granville Barker (Othello als ›savage monster‹) und auch bei Heilman konstatieren. Für Heilman ist Othello die am wenigsten heroische Figur unter Shakespeares tragischen Helden. Heilman vermeint zwei Entwicklungsstränge in der Konzeption der Titelfigur zu erkennen, die uns recht aufschlussreich erscheinen, die Tragik des geistig Zurückgebliebenen und Elemente des späteren bürgerlichen Trauerspiels. Heilman geht bei seiner ersten These von Othellos naiv-stumpfsinnigem Wesen aus, das auch von anderen Kritikern keineswegs geleugnet wird. Es ist in diesem Zusammenhang bezeichnend, dass Othello, verglichen mit anderen Titelfiguren der shakespeareschen Tragödie, relativ wenige Monologe hat. Zudem sind seine Reden noch weniger reflektierend als Iagos Selbstgespräche. Othello, so Heilman, ist im Vergleich zu Macbeth, Antony und Hamlet ein Kind. Shakespeare war damals offenbar an der Diskrepanz zwischen Alter und geistiger Entwicklung als tragischem Konflikt interessiert und entwickelte dieses Motiv in King Lear bis an die Grenze des Möglichen.\n\nHeilmans zweite These ist in ihrem Ansatz mit T. S. Eliots bereits referierter Wertung Othellos als Flucht in den Ästhetizismus verwandt, zumal sie ebenfalls vom Ende des Stückes ausgeht. Für Heilman ist Othellos Versuch am Schluss der Tragödie, seine heroischen Taten von einst in Erinnerung zu rufen, ein Indiz einer neuen tragischen Konzeption, die sich schließlich im bürgerlichen Trauerspiel kristallisierte. Wir sollten in Parenthese anmerken, dass Othello bereits im ersten Akt indirekt über seine heroisch-exotischen Abenteuer berichtet. Dieser ›romantische Historiker seiner selbst‹, so Heilman, ist Vorläufer des späteren bürgerlichen Helden.\n\nTragisch ist auch Desdemonas Schicksal. Auch sie vermag nicht die drohende Gefahr zu erkennen und wendet sich, wie wir gesehen haben, ausgerechnet an Iago mit der Bitte um Aufklärung. Insofern hat J. McLauchlan recht, wenn sie Othellos mangelnde Kenntnis seiner Gattin mit Desdemonas mangelnder Kenntnis ihres Gatten vergleicht und diese wechselseitige Unkenntnis als tragisches Element des Stückes hervorhebt. Desdemona kann von Iago nur getäuscht, aber nicht verführt werden, weil ihre Liebe zu Othello total ist. Ihr Schicksal ist das Martyrium einer Heiligen, denn sie wird nicht zufällig mit dem Epitheton »blessed« belegt. Desdemona geht im Bewusstsein der eigenen Unschuld in den Tod und zeigt auch am Ende nur Liebe für ihren Mörder, wie ihre letzten Worte bezeugen: »Commend me to my kind lord, O, farewell!« (V,2,126). Wie sehr Shakespeare bei der Gestaltung der weiblichen Hauptfigur an die christliche Tradition dachte, geht auch aus der dramatischen Anlage der Mordszene hervor. Desdemona wird ermordet und kommt noch einmal zu Bewusstsein: Martyrium und, wenn man einigen Kritikern folgt, Auferstehung.\n\nDie Tragödie Othello ist ein Stück, dessen poetische Elemente im Rahmen der vorhergehenden Charakteranalyse nur gelegentlich Erwähnung fanden. Mit Hilfe der Konkordanz können wir die umfangreiche Metaphorik dieses Dramas systematisch erfassen. Wir stellen dabei fest, dass Othello relativ viele durchgehende metaphorische Bezüge aufweist, ohne deren Berücksichtigung das Stück schwerlich adäquat interpretiert werden kann. Wie bei anderen Shakespeare-Dramen sind die wichtigsten Metaphern antithetisch konzipiert. Sie lassen mithin auf Spannungsverhältnisse schließen, die im vordergründigen Handlungs­ablauf nur teilweise erkennbar oder ganz verdeckt sind. Die wichtigsten Metaphern sind: Himmel und Hölle; Licht und Dunkelheit; Tag und Nacht; schwarz und weiß; Heilung und Krankheit; Musik und Unruhe; See, Sturm, Krieg; Feuer, Flamme, Fackel (Iago und später – in Akt V – auch Othello als Luzifer!).\n\nWir wollen abschließend auf eine Wertung dieser Tragödie verzichten und auch der Versuchung widerstehen, den von der Kritik vorgeschlagenen Gattungsbezeichnungen (u. a. ›tragedy of passion‹, ›tragedy of consuming love and consuming hate‹) eine weitere hinzuzufügen. Eine ­kritische Stellungnahme zu diesem Stück wäre jedoch unvollständig, wenn wir – fasziniert durch das reiche, den Geist der Shakespearezeit sprengende Aussagepotenzial – die formale Nähe zur aristotelischen Norm nicht würdigen würden. Von Shakespeares großen Tragödien kommt Othello den geforderten Einheiten von Zeit, Ort und Handlung am nächsten. Es verwundert daher nicht, dass ein so streng auf klassische Normen achtender Kritiker wie Samuel Johnson seiner Interpretation eine bescheidene Warnung vorausschickte: »The beauties of this play impress themselves so strongly upon the attention of the reader, that they can draw no aid from critical illustration.«\n\nDieter Hamblock\n  \n\n# Hinweise zur E-Book-Ausgabe\n\nDie E-Books des Reclam Verlags verwenden entsprechend der jeweiligen Buchausgabe Sperrungen zur Hervorhebung von Textpassagen.

The play begins in Venice, where Iago, a subordinate of Othello’s and a captain in the Venetian defense forces, tells Roderigo that Othello has passed him over for promotion. Instead, Othello, a Moor, has chosen the noble and popular Michael Cassio to be his lieutenant. Iago tells Roderigo that he will have his revenge on Othello but behave as a loyal friend while plotting against him. Iago enlists Roderigo to help, and Roderigo agrees because of his infatuation with Desdemona, who has just eloped with Othello. The two men begin by waking Desdemona’s father, Brabantio, with racial and sexual epithets, alerting him that his daughter has run off to marry Othello. An incensed Brabantio raises a mob and confronts Othello in front of the Venetian senate, but Desdemona arrives and testifies to her love for Othello, saving the marriage. The senate, meanwhile, has decided to send Othello to Cyprus to defend it against a Turkish fleet, and the strong-willed and eloquent Desdemona insists on accompanying him.\nThe Turkish fleet is destroyed in a storm, leaving the characters free to celebrate their victory as well as the marriage of Othello and Desdemona. Iago has convinced Roderigo to sell his land and accompany him to Cyprus with money, promising that he will help him seduce Desdemona. Iago then gets Cassio drunk and uses Roderigo to draw him into a fight, prompting Othello to demote him. He convinces a distraught Cassio to ask Desdemona to lobby Othello on his behalf, then poisons Othello against them both by insinuating, then outright accusing Cassio and Desdemona, of having an affair. The success of Iago’s plot hinges on Desdemona’s handkerchief, which she drops accidentally after trying to soothe a distraught Othello. Iago’s wife, Emilia, gives Iago the handkerchief but doesn’t know what he plans to do with it.\nIago plants the handkerchief in Cassio’s room, and Cassio in turn gives it to Bianca, a local woman who prostitutes herself for food and clothing. Bianca is in love with Cassio and suspects the handkerchief came from another woman he is sleeping with. Iago draws Cassio into discussing Bianca, and Othello eavesdrops and believes he is speaking about Desdemona. Bianca then enters and confronts Cassio, and Othello sees the handkerchief, sending him into a jealous fury. Iago further goads him into planning the deaths of both Cassio and Desdemona. Iago enlists Roderigo to carry out Cassio’s murder by convincing him that he will take Cassio’s place as Desdemona’s lover. Roderigo, meanwhile, has begun to suspect that Iago had swindled him out of his money, but agrees to the plot.\nRoderigo attacks Cassio, and both men are wounded but survive. Iago arrives on-scene and murders Roderigo so that he won’t reveal his plot. He blames Bianca for the attack on Cassio. Desdemona, meanwhile, has come to fear Othello and seems to suspect that her life may be in danger. She asks Emilia to put her wedding sheets on the bed and goes to sleep. Othello enters as she sleeps and kisses her. When she awakes, he announces that she must make peace with God because he is going to kill her. She repeatedly protests her innocence and says that Cassio will also deny the affair, but Othello tells her (incorrectly) that Cassio is dead, and she realizes that she can’t convince her husband of her innocence. He strangles her according to Iago’s suggestion, and shortly thereafter Emilia arrives in time to hear Desdemona’s dying statement that she has been unjustly murdered. Even in her last moments, however, Desdemona protects Othello and refuses to name him as her murderer.\nA grief-stricken and enraged Emilia insults Othello’s intelligence and proclaims Desdemona’s innocence. Iago, Cassio, and Venetian envoys Lodovico and Montano enter, and Othello explains his rationale for killing Desdemona. Emilia realizes what Iago has done and refuses to keep quiet, revealing that she was the one who gave Iago the incriminating handkerchief. Iago kills Emilia for speaking the truth and betraying him, and she falls on the bed and dies next to Desdemona. Othello implies that Iago is some sort of devil and wounds him, preferring that he live and be tortured, as Lodovico and Cassio pledge to do. Othello asks the men to remember his previous noble deeds when telling his story back in Venice and kills himself, also falling on the bed. Lodovico charges Cassio with punishing Iago and governing Cyprus and says that he will return to Venice to tell the sad story.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.supersummary.com/othello/", "author": "William Shakespeare", "characters": {"Iago": "Iago is a subordinate of Othello’s and a captain in the Venetian defense forces. Othello passes him over for promotion in favor of the well-spoken, handsome Cassio, although Iago believes he is more experienced. Iago is determined to exact his revenge on Othello for this perceived insult, and also suspects that both Othello and Cassio have had sex with his wife Emilia, even though he has no evidence of this. Iago’s pride, jealousy, and misogyny combine into a destructive malice whose ultimate outcome even Iago can’t entirely predict. Throughout the play, he infects the other characters with his own negative traits, inciting them, and himself, to murder. In addition to driving Othello to kill Desdemona and Roderigo to attempt to kill Cassio, Iago himself kills Roderigo, as well as his wife, Emilia. He has a keen sense of other men’s insecurities and motivations, and in his plots, reduces women to prizes to be won, guarded, and discarded.", "Roderigo": "As one of Desdemona’s rejected suitors, Iago tricks Roderigo into giving Iago most of his money and manipulates him into ruining Cassio’s career before attempting to murder him. When Roderigo begins to suspect Iago is using him, Iago kills him. Roderigo’s lust for Desdemona, and Iago’s promise that he will help gratify it, drives most of his behavior.", "Brabantino": "Brabantino is a Venetian senator and Desdemona’s father. Brabantio is horrified that his daughter has eloped with Othello because of his race, but reluctantly accepts the marriage when Desdemona attests to her love for Othello before the senate. Brabantio’s bigotry and misogyny—he warns Othello that if Desdemona would trick her father she would also trick her husband—echoes Iago’s and provides a framework of Othello’s insecurities for Iago to exploit. Brabantio dies before Desdemona’s murder, allegedly from sorrow over her marriage.", "Desdemona": "Desdemona is a Venetian woman who falls in love with the much-older Othello by listening to tales of his life at her father’s dinner table. Desdemona is good-natured and clever, and her elopement with Othello after passing up many Venetian suitors demonstrates that she has a strong will. Othello states that he loves Desdemona for her mind. Later, Othello murderers her in a misconstrued jealous rage, and she remains loyal to him, even in death.", "Cassio": "As Othello’s new lieutenant, Cassio is well-spoken, attractive, and an object of envy to Iago. Though usually well-mannered, Cassio is prone to short-temperedness, a quality Iago exploits so that he, in a drunken scuffle with Roderigo, loses his position. Cassio is respectful towards Desdemona, but ridicules Bianca, the prostitute who is in love with him. By planting evidence, lying, and staging a misleading conversation with Cassio, Iago convinces Othello that Cassio is Desdemona’s lover. Cassio survives Iago’s plot to kill him, and at the end of the play, he takes Othello’s place as governor of Cyprus.", "Emilia": "Emilia is Iago’s wife and an attendant and confidante to Desdemona. Emilia unwittingly helps Iago frame Cassio by giving him Desdemona’s dropped handkerchief, which Iago plants in Cassio’s bedroom. When she learns that Othello suspects Desdemona of cheating on him, Emilia acts as Desdemona’s advocate, insisting on her innocence. She holds a grimmer view of marriage than Desdemona and explains Othello’s sudden viciousness towards her as part of the natural course of husbands revealing their true selves only after the wedding. She confronts Othello after he murders Desdemona, heedless of his drawn sword. She similarly defies her husband, refuses to be silent or to go home, and exposes his plot, even after he also draws his sword on her. Iago kills her as a result of her allegiance to Desdemona and her insistence on the truth over obedience to her husband.", "Montano": "Montano is the governor of Cyprus before Othello’s arrival. Cassio wounds him after he tries to break up the fight between him and Roderigo, resulting in Cassio’s demotion.", "Bianca": "Bianca is a Cyprus woman who prostitutes herself for food and clothing. She falls in love with Cassio, who is one of her customers. After Roderigo wounds Cassio, Iago attempts to blame Bianca, a woman of low social status, for ordering Cassio’s murder.", "Lodovico": "Lodovico is a Venetian and a relative of Brabantio and Desdemona. When Lodovico arrives with a letter from Venice ordering Othello’s return and Cassio’s promotion to governor of Venice, Othello is enraged and strikes Desdemona, shocking Lodovico. At the end of the play, Lodovico questions Othello and Cassio, which pieces together Iago’s entire plot for the characters that remain.", "Gratiano": "Another Venetian and relative of Brabantio and Desdemona, Gratiano arrives in Cyprus with Lodovico. He guards Othello after he murders Desdemona, and he inherits Othello’s property after he commits suicide."}, "chapter_summaries": {"Act I, Scene 1 Summary": "Iago complains to Roderigo that his commander Othello, a Moor, has promoted Cassio to be his lieutenant instead of the more battle-hardened Iago. When Roderigo suggests he quit his post, Iago tells him he instead plans to pretend to serve Othello while acting in his own self-interest. To that end, he suggests that he and Roderigo alert Desdemona’s father, Brabantio, that she has eloped with Othello. Roderigo, a rejected suitor of Desdemona, agrees, and the two wake Brabantio and incite him with lewd, racist references to miscegenation: “Even now, now, very now, an old black ram/Is tupping your white ewe” (97-98). When Brabantio discovers that Desdemona is missing, he raises an armed mob and asks Roderigo to lead him to Othello. Iago, not wanting to be seen working against Othello, exits before Brabantio can recognize him.", "Act I, Scene 2 Summary": "At Othello’s residence, Iago, pretending to be allied with Othello, warns him of Brabantio’s anger and impending arrival. Othello expresses confidence that his past service to the Venetian government, noble status, and legal marriage to Desdemona will protect him. Cassio enters and informs Othello that the senate has summoned him for an urgent matter of state. As Othello prepares to go with Cassio, Brabantio, Roderigo, and their mob enter. Brabantio accuses him of using magic to control Desdemona and declares his intent to imprison Othello. Othello replies that the Duke has summoned him on important business, and Brabantio, also a senator, discovers that he too has been summoned. He goes with Othello to settle the matter before the senate.", "Act I, Scene 3 Summary": "In the senate, the senators are discussing the Turks’ impending siege on Cyprus. Othello and Brabantio enter, and Brabantio again accuses Othello of controlling his daughter with magic or drugs because she is “not deficient, blind, or/lame of sense” (76) enough to marry him otherwise. Othello tells the senate that Desdemona fell in love with him while listening to his tales of his adventures at her father’s dinner table. Iago brings Desdemona before the senate and she attests to her love for Othello. The senate intends to send him to defend Cyprus, and Desdemona asks to accompany him, which the senate agree to. Having failed to ruin the marriage of Othello and Desdemona, Roderigo contemplates killing himself. Iago brushes aside Roderigo’s despair and says he should instead acquire money and join him in seeking revenge on Othello. Roderigo vows to sell his land, and after he exits, Iago reveals that he will use Roderigo’s money to fund his own revenge plan. He also reveals that there is a rumor that Othello has slept with his wife, Emilia, and the possibility alone is enough to motivate him to ruin Othello. He then describes his plan to frame Cassio as Desdemona’s lover.", "Act I Analysis": "The first act establishes the Venetians’ view of Othello. They regard him as a noble servant of the state and a skilled warrior, but do not regard him as an equal because he is a “Moor” (likely meaning North African). The senators and Duke of Venice view Othello’s good traits as qualities that bely his race. This ingrained bigotry allows Roderigo and Iago to goad Desdemona’s father into a fury over her elopement with Othello. However, the Turks’ impending attack on Cyprus reinforces Othello’s military importance to Venice and probably helps convince the Senate to let the marriage stand. Although he initially seems allied with Roderigo, Iago’s soliloquies let the reader see that he is using Roderigo for his own ends. Since Iago has no true allegiance to any other character, soliloquies will be an important window to his intentions throughout the play. The dramatic irony that results from Iago’s revelations heighten the tension for readers and audiences and also gives them an opportunity to appreciate the complexity of Iago’s manipulations.", "Act II, Scene 1 Summary": "A storm destroys the Turkish fleet, and Cassio, Roderigo, Iago, Emilia, and Desdemona land in Cyprus, victorious, but concerned that Othello’s ship has not yet arrived. Cassio kisses Iago’s wife, Emilia, upon meeting her. Iago makes insulting jokes about Emilia’s chiding nature then goes on to make sexist generalizations about women: “Come on, come on! You are pictures out of door,/bells in your parlors, wildcats in your kitchens,/saints in your injuries, devils being offended, players/in your huswifery, and huswives in your beds” (122-25). Desdemona goads Iago into further wordplay that becomes increasingly insulting towards women, at one point saying that the destiny of a beautiful, eloquent, modest, wise, and restrained woman is to nurse babies and pinch pennies.Othello enters and reunites with Desdemona. After the two exits, Iago tells Roderigo that Desdemona is in love with Cassio, saying that Othello is too old and ugly to hold her sexual interest. He predicts that Desdemona and Cassio will become lovers unless Roderigo gets Cassio out of the way by drawing him into a fight, which will compel Othello to fire him. When he’s alone, Iago states that he thinks Cassio and Desdemona could really love each other, that he hates Othello but admits he is a good and loving man and husband, and that he himself loves Desdemona in a vengeful parallel to Othello’s rumored infidelity with his own wife. He says that he wants to get even with Othello “wife for wife” (321), or at least drive Othello insane with jealousy over Cassio, who Iago also suspects of sleeping with his wife. Iago further admits that he doesn’t have a concrete idea of how his plan will end.", "Act II, Scene 2 Summary": "A herald announces that Othello has ordered a combined victory-and-wedding-celebration to be held on Cyprus.", "Act II, Scene 3 Summary": "Cassio, Iago, and the other guards celebrate the victory of the Turks while Othello and Desdemona retire to consummate their marriage. Iago goads Cassio into drinking too much. When he leaves, Iago implies to Montano, a Cyprus official, that Cassio is an alcoholic and as such, unreliable. Meanwhile, Roderigo goads Cassio into a fight, and Montano attempts to restrain Cassio, who then wounds him. Roderigo sounds the alarm which summons Othello, who demands to know the cause of the fight. Iago pretends that he doesn’t want to tattle-tale on anyone and waits until Montano implicates Cassio. Othello and Montano press him, and he repeats what he saw but defends Cassio to Othello. Othello strips Cassio of his position, and Cassio is grief-stricken over the loss of his good reputation. Iago convinces him to ask Desdemona to intervene on his behalf. A dispirited Roderigo tells Iago his money is almost gone and that he will return to Venice, but Iago convinces him to be patient. When Roderigo leaves, Iago states that he will ask his wife, Emilia, to convince Desdemona to help Cassio, which will make it appear that she has feelings for him.", "Act II Analysis": "The sudden removal of the Turks as a plot point implicitly diminishes some of Othello’s social capital. Without an enemy to fight, Iago is free to reduce Othello’s identity to his (according to Iago, inferior) race and advanced age. Iago’s motives also become more amorphous: he admires Othello but hates him, and Iago suspects both Othello and Cassio of having sex with his wife, a suspicion he never elaborates on. By saying that the suspicion is enough reason for him to act, Iago reveals that he isn’t rational—his plots arise from his own shifting insecurities. To that end, he begins by ensuring that Cassio loses his position and Othello’s esteem, and stokes Roderigo’s lust for Desdemona by making him as jealous of Cassio as Iago is. His view of his wife as a sexually receptive object also sets the pattern for how he explains Desdemona to Roderigo: Othello couldn’t possibly hold her sexual interest, and Cassio is a convenient and appealing alternative. He frames her imaginary interest in Cassio not as something borne out of choice, but out of proximity and indiscriminate, animal passion.", "Act III, Scene 1 Summary": "Emilia assures Cassio that Desdemona is speaking to Othello on his behalf, but Cassio is impatient and asks that he be allowed to make his case to Desdemona directly. Emilia agrees to arrange a meeting between the two of them.", "Act III, Scene 2 Summary": "Othello gives Iago letters for the ship captain to deliver to the Senate of Venice and asks him to rejoin him once his task is done.", "Act III, Scene 3 Summary": "Cassio makes his case to Emilia and Desdemona, who vows to convince Othello to reinstate him. Cassio leaves when Iago and Othello enter, and Iago remarks that he doesn’t like to see Cassio “steal away so guiltylike,/Seeing your coming” (42-43). Desdemona presses Othello to reinstate Cassio, and he agrees for her sake. Desdemona says that he has not truly done her a favor, because reinstating Cassio is for Othello’s own good. When she leaves, Iago manipulates Othello into suspecting Cassio by pretending to be reluctant to air his own suspicions of Desdemona’s infidelity. Othello tries to cast away doubt, saying there is no point in jealousy without proof, and once proof is obtained there is also no point in jealousy, since there is no longer reason to love. Iago agrees and recommends Othello neither trust nor suspect but begin to observe Desdemona closely. The more Iago protests that his own suspicions are probably baseless, the more Othello believes them. He muses to himself that Iago is extremely honest and an excellent judge of character. Iago exits, and Othello begins to curse marriage, saying that men can lay claim to women but not their appetites.  Desdemona and Emilia enter. Desdemona notices Othello looks unwell and tries to mop his head with her handkerchief, which he rejects. The handkerchief falls to the floor. After the two exits, Emilia picks it up and remarks that it was the first gift Othello gave to Desdemona and that Iago had been asking her to steal it. She presents it to Iago, who will not tell her why he wants it, and he remarks that Desdemona will be upset to lose it. When she exits, Iago delivers a short soliloquy explaining that he will plant the handkerchief in Cassio's room to cast suspicion on him because: “Trifles light as air/Are to the jealous confirmations strong/As proofs of holy writ (370-72). Othello enters, tortured by the idea of Desdemona’s infidelity and angry with Iago for planting the idea in his head in the absence of proof. When Othello threatens him, Iago pretends he’s offended, gives his verbal resignation, and berates himself for being honest. Othello immediately repents and tells Iago that he should always be honest, yet Othello presses him for more evidence. Iago claims that he once slept next to Cassio, and that in his sleep Cassio called him Desdemona and kissed him. This prompts Othello, who before had only spoken of banishing Desdemona, to say, “I’ll tear her to pieces!” (490). Iago then tells Othello that he saw Cassio wipe his beard with Desdemona’s handkerchief. Othello, enraged, charges Iago with ensuring Cassio’s death within three days. Iago agrees but tells Othello to let Desdemona live, which prompts Othello to vow that he will kill her. He then promotes Iago to lieutenant.", "Act III, Scene 4 Summary": "Desdemona has a short comic dialogue with the Clown who serves her and Othello. She asks the Clown to tell Cassio that she on his behalf has worked. When the Clown leaves, Desdemona laments the loss of her handkerchief and tells Emilia she is fortunate that Othello does not have a jealous nature. Emilia pretends not to know what happened to the handkerchief.Othello enters and come up with an excuse to ask to borrow the handkerchief he gave Desdemona and tells her it is a curse to lose it—specifically that the owner’s husband would hate her if she lost it or gave it away. He insists she bring it to him, and she thinks he is trying to trick and distract her into dropping the subject of Cassio’s reinstatement. She continues to press his suit, interspersed with Othello’s angry demands for the handkerchief. Othello exits and Emilia remarks that he seems jealous, and that men only show their true selves after a year or two, after they have had their fill of their wives.Iago and Cassio enter, and Iago urges Cassio to keep pressing Desdemona for help. Desdemona explains that she has done all she can and is paying for it with Othello’s displeasure, such that she has never seen before. Iago remarks that he has never seen Othello angry and volunteers to speak with him. When he leaves, both women say that they hope it is a matter of state that makes Othello so angry, and Emilia remarks that jealousy needs no cause and feeds upon itself. They exit, and Bianca, who Cassio is having an affair with, enters to say that she misses him and has been looking for him. He giver her Desdemona’s handkerchief, and when she becomes suspicious that he got it from another woman, he says that he just found it in his chamber.", "Act III Analysis": "This act shows the fulmination of Iago’s plot. In Scene 3, he transforms Othello from a trusting husband into a murderous one. Iago is able to do this because Othello trusts him more than Desdemona, and Iago successfully enacts an “us versus them” gender binary, pitting women against men. Iago hearkens to Brabantio’s own logic in this vein—that Desdemona’s trickery of him, her father, was not a specific plot for a specific end but a pattern that applies to the world of men. Iago reminds Othello: “She did deceive her father, marrying you,/And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks,/ She loved them most” (3.3 238-40). Iago coaxes Othello into placing his masculine identity (and its attendant values and behavioral demands) before his individual judgement, beliefs, and feelings. Emilia and Desdemona are startled by Othello’s frightening transformation, which is all the more frightening because, as Emilia points out, jealousy feeds upon itself without cause. Desdemona does not realize that Iago has made her a stereotype in Othello’s eyes, blinding him to her human qualities.", "Act IV, Scene 1 Summary": "Iago is trying (and intending the opposite) to convince Othello that Cassio’s possession of Desdemona’s handkerchief isn’t necessarily proof that the two had sex, saying that perhaps they only kissed or lay naked in bed, “not meaning any harm” (6). Iago said he heard Cassio bragging about being in bed with Desdemona and supplies an image by saying, “With her—on her—what you will” (44). This throws Othello into a fit of rage and he says he will kill Cassio first and then force him to confess. Othello, overcome, falls into a fit, and Iago, in an aside, congratulates himself on how well his plan is working. Cassio enters to find Othello in the throes of epilepsy, but Iago sends him away.Continuing his reverse psychology campaign, Iago tells Othello that lots of men are married to unfaithful women and that he’s lucky to at least know the truth about Desdemona. Needing more proof to convince Othello, Iago tells him to hide while he tricks Cassio into talking about his exploits with Desdemona. When Cassio reenters, Iago asks him about Bianca, a prostitute who sells herself for food and clothing, and who has fallen in love with Cassio. Othello witnesses Cassio laughing and talking derisively about Bianca and thinks he is speaking of Desdemona. Bianca enters and confronts Cassio for giving her a handkerchief belonging to some other “minx” (174). Othello sees it, and Cassio goes after Bianca to keep her from making a scene in the streets.Iago asks Othello to remember how Cassio laughed about his use of Desdemona, and Othello at first is outraged at the insult to her. Iago urges him to remember that she is not a good woman, and Othello swings between praising her fine qualities, including her wit, and damning her. Seeing that Othello is having trouble staying angry at Desdemona, Iago then works on Othello’s masculine pride by suggesting that, since Othello isn’t bothered by her cheating, he could just let her do it. This succeeds in enraging Othello who says he will chop her to pieces, then asks Iago to acquire poison so that he can kill her that same night. Iago says, “Do it not with poison. Strangle her in her bed,/even the bed she hath contaminated” (228-29). Iago says that he in turn, will kill Cassio.Iago and Desdemona enter with Lodovico, a relative of Desdemona’s from Venice with a message for Othello from the Duke and Senators. Lodovico asks after Cassio, and Othello becomes angry when Desdemona explains his falling-out with Othello. The message instructs Othello to return to Venice and leave Cassio in charge in Cyprus. Desdemona says she is glad, and, believing that she means for Cassio’s promotion and not her return to Venice, Othello strikes her. Lodovico is shocked at Othello’s uncharacteristic behavior and tells him to make amends with the crying Desdemona. Instead he insults and torments her before ordering her finally to leave.After Othello leaves, Lodovico ask Iago if he is losing his mind, and Iago implies that he is and will likely continue to threaten Desdemona. Lodovico wonders if it’s the letter that has upset Othello, but Iago reiterates that he should only observe Othello’s actions for himself. Lodovico says he is sorry to have so misjudged Othello’s character.", "Act IV, Scene 2 Summary": "Othello grills Emilia on the relationship between Cassio and Desdemona, and Emilia swears there is nothing going on between the two and that Desdemona is a good woman and faithful wife. Othello doesn’t believe her and sends for Desdemona, then orders Emilia to leave. Desdemona can tell Othello is furious and begs him to explain why. When he accuses her, she swears she is faithful, and Othello tells her she is only damning herself by lying. He begins to weep and observes that he could have handled any hardship except being rejected by his wife and being made a laughingstock. He continues to accuse Desdemona of being a “whore” (99), and she continues to swear she isn’t. He doesn’t believe her protests and when Emilia reenters, leaves the room.A shocked Desdemona asks Emilia to put her wedding sheets on the bed and send for Iago. Desdemona and Emilia recount Othello’s accusations and vicious verbal abuse, with Emilia lamenting Desdemona’s ill treatment after giving up so much for Othello’s sake: “Hath she forsook so many noble matches,/Her father and her country and her friends,/To be called “whore”? Would it not make one/weep?” (146-49). Iago reassures Desdemona and pretends to be outraged on her behalf. Emilia, meanwhile, concludes (correctly) that some malicious person must have planted the idea in Othello’s head. Iago rejects the idea, tells Emilia she is a fool, and tells Desdemona that it is only the affairs of state that have put Othello in a bad mood.After Desdemona and Emilia exit, Roderigo enters, angry with Iago for having tricked him out of his money. He reveals that he had given Iago jewels to pass to Desdemona in the hopes of winning some “sudden respect and acquaintance” (221)—likely meaning sexual favor—but it didn’t work. He threatens to ask Desdemona to return the jewels, and if she doesn’t have them, he will instead challenge the deceiving Iago to a duel. Iago pretends to have a newfound respect for Roderigo but insists he has been honest with him. He then lies and tells Roderigo that Othello is bound for Mauritania with Desdemona, and that if Roderigo kills Cassio, Desdemona will have to stay in Cyprus, and Roderigo will get to sleep with her. Roderigo is interested, and Iago promises to give him even more reasons to kill Cassio.", "Act IV, Scene 3 Summary": "Othello is talking with Lodovico and tells Desdemona to go to prepare for bed and to send Emilia away. Desdemona asks Emilia to use her wedding sheets as her death shroud, then tells her of her mother’s maid, Barbary, who was abandoned by her lover and used to sing a song called “Willow.” She sings the song while Emilia helps her dress for bed, and the lyrics include the lines: “Let nobody blame him, his scorn I approve” (56). Desdemona asks Emilia if she would ever cheat on her husband “for all the world” and Emilia jokes: “The world’s a huge thing. It is a great price/for a small vice” (77-79). Desdemona says she wouldn’t, and Emilia says that in any case, if a wife cheats on her husband, it’s likely his fault for cheating on her first or for beating or controlling her. She says that infidelity is a revenge that shows men that their wives are just as much human beings as they are: “They see, and/smell,/And have their palates both for sweet and sour,/As husbands have” (105-08). She concludes that husbands must treat their wives well, or else find that their wives will take on their own bad habits, and leaves Desdemona alone in the bedroom.", "Act IV Analysis": "Iago continues to stoke Othello’s rage by forcing him to picture Cassio and Desdemona together. Othello begins to lose his resolve when he thinks about the human qualities that he loves about Desdemona. To overcome this, Iago must threaten Othello’s masculine pride by suggesting he do nothing and let Desdemona cuckold him. It’s the idea of being made ridiculous in the eyes of other men that incites Othello to say, “I will chop her into messes! Cuckold me?” (4.1. 219). He is externalizing his sense of right and wrong, letting Iago and the imagined judgement of other men dictate his feelings and plans. In the midst of Iago’s insistent objectification of women, particularly to Othello and Roderigo, Emilia, in Scene 3, expresses that she is more than a passive sexual object and that a woman’s infidelity is a reclamation of her humanity. She says that it should show their husbands that they perceive and feel, have their own tastes, and the power to show weakness and exercise choice, just as men do. This act shows that Iago’s and Emilia’s views of a woman’s sexual expression are in opposition. In Iago’s construction, it is the men having sex with the straying wife who gain power over her husband; in Emilia’s, it is the straying wife who is demanding equal status to her own morally-lapsed husband.", "Act V, Scene 1 Summary": "With Iago’s urging, Roderigo ambushes Cassio. In a short soliloquy, Iago reveals that both men dying is an ideal outcome for him because if Roderigo lives, he will demand Iago return the jewels, and if Cassio lives, he may find out about Iago’s lies to Othello. Iago is furthermore jealous of Cassio’s beauty and grace. In the fight, Cassio wounds Roderigo, but Iago then stabs Cassio in the leg from behind and flees. Cassio calls for help and Othello enters, pleased that Iago has made good on his pledge to murder Cassio. He says that Iago is a model for how he himself should act, and Othello declares his intention to murder Desdemona.Lodovico and Gratiano, another Venetian statesman, hear Cassio’s and Roderigo’s cries. They go to investigate along with Iago, and when Cassio implicates Roderigo, Iago stabs and kills him, then continues to wonder who the murderers are. Iago offers to bind Cassio’s wound with his shirt, and when Bianca enters, Iago calls her “trash” (99) and announces that he suspects she is behind the attack. Emilia insults her, and Bianca replies, “I am no strumpet, but of life as honest/As you that thus abuse me” (143-44). In an aside, Iago comments that the events of the night are going to make or break him", "Act V, Scene 2 Summary": "Othello enters the bedroom with a light and watches the sleeping Desdemona. In a soliloquy, Othello resolves not to mar Desdemona’s beauty when he kills her, and laments that it is almost persuading him not to. He asserts that he must kill her to prevent her from betraying more men and kisses her, then likens himself to heaven/God, because he “strikes where it doth love” (24). Desdemona wakes, and Othello tells her she should pray for forgiveness for any crime since he plans to kill her. She maintains that she is guilty of nothing, but says she still feels his murderous look. When he again tells her to address her sins, she says, “They are loves I bear to you” (49). Othello then for the first time accuses her of cheating on him with Cassio and says he saw Cassio with her handkerchief. She asks Othello to summon Cassio since he will say it isn’t true and Othello, referring to Cassio and Iago’s conversation about Bianca, says he has already admitted to having sex with her. Desdemona insists he will not say so, and Othello agrees, saying (incorrectly) that Cassio is dead. Desdemona realizes she is trapped and begs that Othello banish her instead of killing her. While she protests, tries to leave the bed, and asks to say one last prayer, Othello says it’s too late and smothers her. Emilia begins to call for Othello from offstage. Othello thinks there is still some sign of life from Desdemona and attacks her again, until he’s certain she’s dead.Othello draws the curtain around the bed and lets Emilia in. She tells him that Cassio is alive and has killed Roderigo. It turns out that Desdemona is not yet dead, and she cries out that she has been “falsely murdered” (144). Emilia urges her to speak again, and Desdemona proclaims her innocence. When Emilia asks her to name her killer, Desdemona protects Othello by saying, “Nobody. I myself. Farewell,” before dying (152). Othello quickly confesses to a horrified Emilia, who insists on Desdemona’s innocence and calls Othello “a devil” (163). Othello reveals that Iago, Emilia’s own husband, told him of Desdemona’s affair, and Emilia repeatedly asks, “My husband?” as Othello explains Iago’s role in the plot (171, 178, 182). Emilia realizes what her husband has done, proclaims that he is lying and she hopes he rots in hell, and that Desdemona was too fond of Othello, “her most filthy bargain” (192), to ever cheat on him. Othello draws his sword and Emilia says his sword can’t hurt her any more than she has already been hurt. She calls him stupid and says she will tell everyone he is a murderer, then she begins calling for help.Iago, Gratiano, and Montano enter, and Emilia, still not believing that Iago could be so evil, urges him to deny that he told Othello that Desdemona was unfaithful. He at first hedges, saying, “I told him what I thought, and told no more/Than what he found himself was apt and true” (212-13), but when she presses him, he admits that he said Desdemona and Cassio were having an affair. He tells Emilia to stop talking, and she refuses, saying that Othello has murdered Desdemona because of Iago’s lies. She says that she suspected Iago’s villainy, and he orders her to go home. She refuses and says she may never go home again. When Othello explains to Gratiano and Montano that the handkerchief was proof, Emilia exclaims and again insists to Iago that no man will stop her from speaking the truth. He again tells her to go home and draws his sword, shocking Gratiano. Emilia continues to explain how she found the handkerchief and gave it to Iago, who had begged her to steal it. Realizing what Iago has done, Othello rushes at him, but Iago kills Emilia first and flees.Montano exits to purse Iago, leaving Gratiano to guard a disarmed Othello. Emilia sings “Willow” as she dies next to Desdemona. Othello tells Gratiano he has another sword in the bedroom, but will not use it on him, saying it is only the end of his own life. Cassio, Lodovico, and Montano enter with Iago as prisoner. Othello wounds Iago, saying he would rather have him live since death is a happiness, and asks Cassio to forgive him. Othello wants to know why Iago tortured him, but Iago replies that he will not speak, though Gratiano vows to torture him until he does. With letters from Roderigo’s pocket, Roderigo’s surprise deathbed confession, and Cassio’s explanations, the remaining characters work out Iago’s entire plot. Lodovico says that Othello will be stripped of his command and Iago tortured and brought to justice in Venice. Othello urges them not to exaggerate his tale, but to describe him as someone who loved too much and was manipulated into a frenzy. He likens Desdemona to a precious “pearl” (407) that he threw away without understanding her value, and he asks the men to remember his other valiant deeds in service of the state of Venice. He then stabs himself and kisses Desdemona as he dies. Lodovico blames Iago for the three dead people on the bed. He tells Cassio that he will govern Cyprus and decide how to punish Iago while he, Lodovico, will return to Venice and relate what has happened.", "Act V Analysis": "When Iago tries to blame Bianca for Roderigo’s attack on Cassio, her status as a lower-class woman seems to condemn her in the eyes of the other men, and in the eyes of Emilia, who expresses disgust for her and calls her a “strumpet” (5.1 142). Emilia is willing to believe that Bianca is guilty of murder because of what she perceives as her sexual liberality, or immorality. When Bianca counters that she is as “honest” (5.1 143) as Emilia, she is likely referring to her own love for Cassio, and her refusal to let her economic circumstances and the insults of Iago and the other men damage her self-regard. In the next scene, Emilia herself also refuses to be defined or controlled by her husband, Iago, or by Othello. After Othello murders Desdemona, she verbally attacks Othello, even though he threatens her with his sword. In doing so, she insists that her observations, knowledge, and feelings have not only equal weight, but more than Othello’s because they are not polluted with jealous paranoia. When Iago also threatens her with a sword, he is trying to subdue and subordinate her, forcing her to behave in line with his own interests. Instead, Emilia insists on being a separate human being and allies herself with the dead Desdemona, prompting Iago to kill her. Before committing suicide, Othello admits that he was manipulated into madness and threw away Desdemona as if she were a “pearl” (5.2 407) whose value he did not recognize. This line reveals that Othello still thinks of Desdemona as an object whose meaning he did not decipher, not as an individual whose actions and speech he ignored."}}, "num_tokens": 58878}

In the past, the only answer to the problem has been to grapple with the difficulties with the aid of explanatory footnotes (often missing when they are most needed) and a stern teacher. Generations of students have complained that “Shakespeare was ruined for me at school.”\n\nUsually a fuller appreciation of Shakespeare’s plays comes in later life, when the mind has matured and language skills are more developed. Often the desire to read Shakespeare for pleasure and enrichment follows from a visit to the theater, where excellence of acting and production can bring to life qualities which sometimes lie dormant on the printed page.\n\nShakespeare Made Easy can never be a substitute for the original plays. It cannot possibly convey the full meaning of Shakespeare’s poetic expression, which is untranslatable. Shakespeare Made Easy concentrates on the dramatic aspect, enabling the novice to become familiar with the plot and characters, and to experience one facet of Shakespeare’s genius. To know and understand the central issues of each play is a sound starting point for further exploration and development.\n\nDiscretion can be used in choosing the best method to employ. One way is to read the original Shakespeare first, ignoring the modern translation or using it only when interest or understanding flags. Another way is to read the translation first, to establish confidence and familiarity with plots and characters.\n\nEither way, cross-reference can be illuminating. The modern text can explain “what is being said” if Shakespeare’s language is particularly complex or his expression antiquated. The Shakespeare text will show the reader of the modern paraphrase how much more can be expressed in poetry than in prose.\n\nThe use of Shakespeare Made Easy means that the newcomer need never be overcome by textual difficulties. From first to last, a measure of understanding is at hand – the key is provided for what has been a locked door to many students in the past. And as understanding grows, so an awareness develops of the potential of language as a vehicle for philosophic and moral expression, beauty, and the abidingly memorable.\n\nEven professional Shakespearean scholars can never hope to arrive at a complete understanding of the plays. Each critic, researcher, actor or producer merely adds a little to the work that has already been done, or makes fresh interpretations of the texts for new generations. For everyone, Shakespearean appreciation is a journey. Shakespeare Made Easy is intended to help with the first steps.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare\n\nHis life\n\nWilliam Shakespeare was born in Stratford-on-Avon, Warwickshire, on April 23, 1564, the son of a prosperous wool and leather merchant. Very little is known of his early life. From parish records we know that he married Ann Hathaway in 1582, when he was eighteen, and she was twenty-six. They had three children, the eldest of whom died in childhood.\n\nBetween his marriage and the next thing we know about him, there is a gap of ten years. Probably he became a member of a traveling company of actors. By 1592 he had settled in London and had earned a reputation as an actor and playwright.\n\nTheaters were then in their infancy. The first (called The Theatre ) was built by the actor James Burbage in 1576, in Shoreditch, then a suburb of London. Two more followed as the taste for theater grew: The Curtain in 1577 and The Rose in 1587. The demand for new plays naturally increased. Shakespeare probably earned a living adapting old plays and working in collaboration with others on new ones. Today we would call him a “freelance,” since he was not permanently attached to one theater.\n\nIn 1594, a new company of actors, The Lord Chamberlain’s Men, was formed, and Shakespeare was one of the shareholders. He remained a member throughout his working life. The Company was regrouped in 1603 and renamed The King’s Men, with James I as their patron.\n\nShakespeare and his fellow actors prospered. In 1598 they built their own theater, The Globe , which broke away from the traditional rectangular shape of the inn and its yard (the early home of traveling bands of actors). Shakespeare described it in Henry V as “this wooden O,” because it was circular.\n\nMany other theaters were built by investors eager to profit from the new enthusiasm for drama. The Hope , The Fortune , The Red Bull , and The Swan were all open-air “public” theaters. There were also many “private” (or indoor) theaters, one of which ( The Blackfriars ) was purchased by Shakespeare and his friends because the child actors who performed there were dangerous competitors. (Shakespeare denounces them in Hamlet. )\n\nAfter writing some thirty-seven plays (the exact number is something which scholars argue about), Shakespeare retired to his native Stratford, wealthy and respected. He died on his birthday, in 1616.\n\nHis plays\n\nShakespeare’s plays were not all published in his lifetime. None of them comes to us exactly as he wrote it.\n\nIn Elizabethan times, plays were not regarded as either literature or good reading matter. They were written at speed (often by more than one writer), performed perhaps ten or twelve times, and then discarded. Fourteen of Shakespeare’s plays were first printed in Quarto (17cm × 21cm) volumes, not all with his name as the author. Some were authorized (the “good” Quartos) and probably were printed from prompt copies provided by the theater. Others were pirated (the “bad” Quartos) by booksellers who may have employed shorthand writers, or bought actors’ copies after the run of the play had ended.\n\nIn 1623, seven years after Shakespeare’s death, John Hemming and Henry Condell (fellow actors and shareholders in The King’s Men) published a collected edition of Shakespeare’s works – thirty-six plays in all – in a Folio (21cm × 34cm) edition. From their introduction it would seem that they used Shakespeare’s original manuscripts (“we have scarce received from him a blot in his papers”), but the Folio volumes that still survive are not all exactly alike, nor are the plays printed as we know them today, with act and scene divisions and stage directions.\n\nA modern edition of a Shakespeare play is the result of a great deal of scholarly research and editorial skill over several centuries. The aim is always to publish a text (based on the good and bad Quartos and the Folio editions) that most closely resembles what Shakespeare intended. Misprints have added to the problems, so some words and lines are pure guesswork. This explains why some versions of Shakespeare’s plays differ from others.\n\n\n![Image](Images/pg10.jpg)\n\n\nInterior of the Swan Theatre – from a pen and ink drawing made in 1596 (Mansell Collection)\n\nHis theater\n\nThe first playhouse built as such in Elizabethan London, constructed in 1576, was The Theatre. Its co-founders were John Brayne, an investor, and James Burbage, a carpenter turned actor. Like the six or seven “public” (or outdoor) theaters which followed it over the next thirty years, it was situated outside the city, to avoid conflict with the authorities. They disapproved of players and playgoing, partly on moral and political grounds, and partly because of the danger of spreading the plague. (There were two major epidemics during Shakespeare’s lifetime, and on each occasion the theaters were closed for lengthy periods.)\n\nThe Theatre was a financial success, and Shakespeare’s company performed there until 1598, when a dispute over the lease of the land forced Burbage to take down the building. It was recreated in Southwark, as The Globe , with Shakespeare and several of his fellow actors as the principal shareholders.\n\nBy modern standards, The Globe was small. Externally, the octagonal building measured fewer than thirty meters across, but in spite of this it could accommodate an audience of between two and three thousand people. (The largest of the three theaters at the National Theatre complex in London today seats 1160.)\n\nPerformances were advertised by means of playbills posted around the city, and they took place during the hours of daylight when the weather was suitable. A flag flew to show that all was well, to save playgoers a wasted journey.\n\nAt the entrance, a doorkeeper collected one penny (about 60 cents today) for admission to the “pit” – a name taken from the old inn-yards, where bear-baiting and cock-fighting were popular sports. This was the minimum charge for seeing a play. The “groundlings,” as they were called, simply stood around the three sides of the stage, in the open air. Those who were better off could pay extra for a seat under cover. Stairs led from the pit to three tiers of galleries round the walls. The higher one went, the more one paid. The best seats cost one shilling ($7 today). In theaters owned by speculators like Francis Langley and Philip Henslowe, half the gallery takings went to the landlord.\n\nA full house might consist of 800 groundlings and 1500 in the galleries, with a dozen more exclusive seats on the stage itself for the gentry. A new play might run for between six and sixteen performances; the average was about ten. As there were no breaks between scenes, and no intervals, most plays could be performed in two hours. A trumpet sounded three times before the play began.\n\nThe acting company assembled in the Tiring House at the rear of the stage. This was where they “attired” (or dressed) themselves: not in costumes representing the period of the play, but in Elizabethan doublet and hose. All performances were therefore in modern dress, though no expense was spared to make the stage costumes lavish. The entire company was male. By law, actresses were not allowed, and female roles were performed by boys.\n\nAccess to the stage from the Tiring House was through two doors, one on each side of the stage. Because there was no front curtain, every entrance had to have its corresponding exit, so an actor killed on stage had to be carried off. There was no scenery: the audience used its imagination, guided by the spoken word. Storms and night scenes might well be performed on sunny days in midafternoon; the Elizabethan playgoer relied entirely on the playwright’s descriptive skills to establish the dramatic atmosphere.\n\nOnce on stage, the actors and their expensive clothes were protected from sudden showers by a canopy, the underside of which was painted blue and spangled with stars to represent the heavens. A trapdoor in the stage made ghostly entrances and the gravedigging scene in Hamlet possible. Behind the main stage, in between the two entrance doors, there was a curtained area, concealing a small inner stage, useful for bedroom scenes. Above this was a balcony, which served for castle walls (as in Henry V ) or a domestic balcony (as in the famous scene in Romeo and Juliet ).\n\nThe acting style in Elizabethan times was probably more declamatory than we favor today, but the close proximity of the audience also made a degree of intimacy possible. In those days soliloquies and asides seemed quite natural. Act and scene divisions did not exist (those in printed versions of the play today have been added by editors), but Shakespeare often indicates a scene-ending by a rhyming couplet.\n\nA company such as The King’s Men at The Globe would consist of around twenty-five actors, half of whom might be shareholders, and the rest part-timers engaged for a particular play. Among the shareholders in The Globe were several specialists – William Kempe, for example, was a renowned comedian and Robert Armin was a singer and dancer. Playwrights wrote parts to suit the actors who were available, and devised ways of overcoming the absence of women. Shakespeare often has his heroines dress as young men, and physical contact between lovers was formal compared with the realism we expect today.\n\nHis verse\n\nShakespeare wrote his plays mostly in blank verse: that is, unrhymed lines consisting of ten syllables, alternately stressed and unstressed. The technical term for this form is the iambic pentameter. When Shakespeare first began to write for the stage, it was fashionable to maintain this regular beat from the first line of the play till the last.\n\nShakespeare conformed at first, and then experimented. Some of his early plays contain whole scenes in rhyming couplets – in Romeo and Juliet, for example, there is extensive use of rhyme, and as if to show his versatility, Shakespeare even inserts a sonnet into the dialogue.\n\nBut as he matured, he sought greater freedom of expression than rhyme allowed. Rhyme was still used to indicate a scene-ending, or to stress lines that he wished the audience to remember. Generally, though, Shakespeare moved toward the rhythms of everyday speech. This gave him many dramatic advantages, which he fully and subtly exploits in terms of atmosphere, character, emotion, stress and pace.\n\nIt is Shakespeare’s poetic imagery, however, that most distinguishes his verse from that of lesser playwrights. It enables him to stretch the imagination, express complex thought-patterns in memorable language, and convey a number of associated ideas in compressed and economical form. A study of Shakespeare’s imagery – especially in his later plays – is often the key to a full understanding of his meaning and purposes.\n\nAt the other extreme is prose. Shakespeare normally reserves it for servants, clowns, commoners, and pedestrian matters such as lists, messages and letters.\n\nKing Lear\n\nDate\n\nThe play was entered in the Stationer’s Register in November 1607, having been performed before King James in December 1606. It was probably written during the previous year, 1605.\n\nSources\n\nThe main plot of King Lear can be traced to several sources: The Chronicles of England , Scotland and Ireland by Ralph Holinshed (first published in 1577 and reissued in 1587), which tells the story of “Lear the Sonne of Baldud” and his three daughters “Gonorilla, Regan and Cordeilla”; John Higgins’ narrative poem in Mirror of Magistrates (1574 edition), which is written from the viewpoint of “Cordila”; an old play called The True Chronicle History of King Leir (known to have been performed in 1594, and written at least six years earlier); and Book Two of Edmund Spenser’s The Faerie Queene (1590).\n\nThe Gloucester subplot may have been suggested by an episode in Sir Philip Sidney’s Arcadia (1950) in which the King of Paphlagonia, blinded by “a hard-hearted sonne of his,” seeks a rock from which to “cast himselfe headlong to death,” led by his loyal son “poorly arayed and extreamely weather-beaten.”\n\nShakespeare always restructured and developed his source material, and though these texts (and possibly others) were part of his initial working equipment, King Lear bears only a token resemblance to the older stories which he worked upon: for example, in Holinshed and the old chronicle play, Lear and the French army are victorious, and in neither does the King go mad.\n\nText\n\nKing Lear was first published in a Quarto version, in 1608. It was reprinted in 1619, when it was spuriously dated 1608: publishers in Elizabethan times often passed off reprints in this fraudulent way. Shakespeare was not involved in either publication. The play next appeared in the Folio edition of 1623. Hemming and Condell, the editors, are thought to have used a manuscript copy or theater prompt-book, together with the first Quarto, in compiling their text.\n\nThe Quarto omits about 100 lines that appear in the Folio. The Folio omits about 300 lines that are printed in the Quartos. No definitive text therefore exists; all editors must use discretion in preparing the play for publication. This explains why editions often differ from each other.\n\nKing Lear\n\nClicking on a character’s name in the original text will link you to the corresponding modern version text and vice versa.\n\nThe characters\n\nLear King of Britain\n\nKing of France\n\nDuke of Burgundy\n\nDuke of Cornwall Regan’s husband\n\nDuke of Albany Goneril’s husband\n\nEarl of Kent\n\nEarl of Gloucester\n\nEdgar Gloucester’s legitimate son\n\nEdmund Gloucester’s bastard son\n\nCuran a courtier\n\nOld Man Gloucester’s tenant\n\nDoctor\n\nFool\n\nOswald Goneril’s steward\n\nA Captain employed by Edmund\n\nGentleman in the service of Cordelia\n\nHerald\n\nServants to Cornwall\n \nKnights attending on Lear; Officers, Messengers, Soldiers and Attendants\n\nOriginal Text\n\nAct one\n\nScene 1\n\nKing Lear’s Palace.

What would’st thou do, old man?\n\nThink’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak\n\nWhen power to flattery bows? To plainness honour’s bound\n\nWhen majesty falls to folly.

Away!

Sure, her offence\n\nMust be of such unnatural degree\n\nThat monsters it, or your fore-vouched affection\n\nFall into taint; which to believe of her,\n\nMust be a faith that reason without miracle\n\nShould never plant in me.\n\nCordelia I yet beseech your Majesty –\n\nIf for I want that glib and oily art\n\nTo speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,\n\nI’ll do’t before I speak – that you make known\n\nIt is no vicious blot, murder or foulness,\n\nNo unchaste action, or dishonoured step,\n\nThat hath deprived me of your grace and favour,\n\nBut even for want of that for which I am richer,\n\nA still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue\n\nThat I am glad I have not, though not to have it\n\nHath lost me in your liking.\n\nLear Better thou\n\nHadst not been born than not t’have pleased me better.\n\nFrance Is it but this?

Let’s see: come; if it be nothing, I shall\n\nnot need spectacles.\n\nEdmund I beseech you, sir, pardon me; it is a letter from my\n\nbrother that I have not all o’erread, and for so much as I\n\nhave perused, I find it not fit for your o’erlooking.\n\nGloucester Give me the letter, sir.\n\nEdmund I shall offend, either to detain or give it.

Where is he?\n\nEdmund I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you\n\nto suspend your indignation against my brother till you can\n\nderive from him better testimony of his intent, you should\n\nrun a certain course; where, if you violently proceed against\n\nhim, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great gap in\n\nyour own honour, and shake in pieces the heart of his\n\nobedience. I dare pawn down my life for him, that he hath\n\nwrit this to feel my affection to your honour, and to no\n\nother pretence of danger.\n\nGloucester Think you so?\n\nEdmund If your honour judge it meet, I will place you\n\nwhere you shall hear us confer of this, and by an auricular\n\nassurance have your satisfaction; and that without any\n\nfurther delay than this very evening.\n\nGloucester He cannot be such a monster.\n\nEdmund Nor is not, sure.\n\nGloucester To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves\n\nhim.

Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers\n\ndivide: in cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces,\n\ntreason; and the bond cracked ’twixt son and father. This\n\nvillain of mine comes under the prediction; there’s son\n\nagainst father: the King falls from bias of nature; there’s\n\nfather against child.

Sir,\n\nI had thought, by making this well known unto you,\n\nTo have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,\n\nBut what yourself too late have spoke and done,\n\nThat you protect this course, and put it on\n\nBy your allowance; which if you should, the fault\n\nWould not ’scape censure, nor the redress sleep,\n\nWhich, in the tender of a wholesome weal,\n\nMight in their working do you that offence,\n\nWhich else were shame, that then necessity\n\nWill call discreet proceeding.\n\nFool For you know, nuncle,\n\nThe hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,\n\nThat it had its head bit off by its young.\n\nSo out went the candle, and we were left darkling.\n\nLear Are you our daughter?\n\nGoneril I would you would make use of your good wisdom,\n\nWhereof I know you are fraught; and put away\n\nThese dispositions which of late transport you\n\nFrom what you rightly are.\n\nFool May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse?\n\nWhoop, Jug! I love thee.\n\nLear Does any here know me? This is not Lear:\n\nDoes Lear walk thus? Speak thus? Where are his eyes?\n\nEither his notion weakens, his discernings\n\nAre lethargied – Ha! waking? ’tis not so.\n\nWho is it that can tell me who I am?\n\nFool Lear’s shadow.\n\nLear I would learn that; for by the marks of sovereignty,\n\nknowledge and reason, I should be false persuaded I had\n\ndaughters.\n\nFool Which they will make an obedient father.\n\nLear Your name, fair gentlewoman?\n\nGoneril This admiration, sir, is much o’ th’ savour\n\nOf other your new pranks. I do beseech you\n\nTo understand my purposes aright:\n\nAs you are old and reverend, you should be wise.\n\nHere you do keep a hundred knights and squires;\n\nMen so disordered, so deboshed, and bold,\n\nThat this our court, infected with their manners,\n\nShows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust\n\nMakes it more like a tavern or a brothel\n\nThan a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak\n\nFor instant remedy; be then desired\n\nBy her, that else will take the thing she begs,\n\nA little to disquantity your train;\n\nAnd the remainders that shall still depend,\n\nTo be such men as may besort your age,\n\nWhich know themselves and you.\n\nLear Darkness and devils!\n\nSaddle my horses; call my train together.\n\nDegenerate bastard! I’ll not trouble thee:\n\nYet have I left a daughter.\n\nGoneril You strike my people, and your disordered rabble\n\nMake servants of their betters.\n\n[ Enter  Albany ]\n\nLear Woe, that too late repents!

O most small fault,\n\nHow ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!\n\nWhich, like an engine, wrenched my frame of nature\n\nFrom the fixed place, drew from my heart all love,\n\nAnd added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!\n\nBeat at this gate, that let thy folly in [ striking his head ]\n\nAnd thy dear judgment out!

If she must teem,\n\nCreate her child of spleen, that it may live\n\nAnd be a thwart disnatured torment to her!\n\nLet it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,\n\nWith cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,\n\nTurn all her mother’s pains and benefits\n\nTo laughter and contempt that she may feel\n\nHow sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is\n\nTo have a thankless child!

Let it be so: I have another daughter,\n\nWho, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:\n\nWhen she shall hear this of thee, with her nails\n\nShe’ll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find\n\nThat I’ll resume the shape which thou dost think\n\nI have cast off for ever.\n\n[ Exit ]\n\nGoneril Do you mark that?\n\nAlbany I cannot be so partial, Goneril,\n\nTo the great love I bear you, –\n\nGoneril Pray you, content.

You have heard of the news abroad?\n\nI mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing\n\narguments.\n\nEdmund Not I: pray you, what are they?\n\nCuran Have you heard of no likely wars toward, ’twixt the\n\nDukes of Cornwall and Albany?\n\nEdmund Not a word.\n\nCuran You may do then, in time. Fare you well, sir.\n\n[ Exit ]\n\nEdmund The Duke be here to-night! The better!

Light, ho! here!\n\nFly, brother. Torches! Torches! So, farewell.\n\n[ Exit  Edgar ]\n\nSome blood drawn on me would beget opinion\n\nOf my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkards\n\nDo more than this in sport. Father! Father!\n\nStop, stop! No help?\n\n[ Enter  Gloucester,  and Servants with torches ]\n\nGloucester Now, Edmund, where’s the villain?\n\nEdmund Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,\n\nMumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon\n\nTo stand ’s auspicious mistress.\n\nGloucester But where is he?\n\nEdmund Look, sir, I bleed.\n\nGloucester Where is the villain, Edmund?\n\nEdmund Fled this way, sir, when by no means he could –\n\nGloucester [ To Servants ] Pursue him, ho!

I know thee not.\n\nKent Fellow, I know thee.\n\nOswald What dost thou know me for?\n\nKent A knave, a rascal, an eater of broken meats; a base,\n\nproud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound,\n\nfilthy worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered, action-taking\n\nwhoreson, glass-gazing, super-serviceable, finical rogue;\n\none-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way\n\nof good service, and art nothing but the composition of a\n\nknave, beggar, coward, pandar, and the son and heir of a\n\nmongrel bitch: one whom I will beat into clamorous whining\n\nif thou deniest the least syllable of thy addition.\n\nOswald Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail\n\non one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!\n\nKent What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou\n\nknowest me! Is it two days since I tripped up thy heels and\n\nbeat thee before the King? Draw, you rogue; for though it be\n\nnight, yet the moon shines: I’ll make a sop o’ th’ moonshine\n\nof you.

Speak.\n\nOswald I am scarce in breath, my lord.\n\nKent No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You\n\ncowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a tailor made thee.\n\nCornwall Thou art a strange fellow; a tailor make a man?\n\nKent A tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or a painter could not have\n\nmade him so ill, though they had been but two years\n\no’ th’ trade.\n\nCornwall Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?\n\nOswald This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared at\n\nsuit of his grey beard –\n\nKent Thou whoreson zed!

You beastly knave, know you no\n\nreverence?\n\nKent Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.\n\nCornwall Why art thou angry?\n\nKent That such a slave as this should wear a sword,\n\nWho wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,\n\nLike rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain\n\nWhich are too intrinse t’unloose; smooth every passion\n\nThat in the natures of their lords rebel;\n\nBring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;\n\nRenege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks\n\nWith every gale and vary of their masters,\n\nKnowing nought, like dogs, but following.\n\nA plague upon your epileptic visage!\n\nSmile you my speeches, as I were a fool?\n\nGoose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,\n\nI’d drive ye cackling home to Camelot.\n\nCornwall What, art thou mad, old fellow?\n\nGloucester How fell you out? Say that.\n\nKent No contraries hold more antipathy\n\nThan I and such a knave.\n\nCornwall Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?\n\nKent His countenance likes me not.\n\nCornwall No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.\n\nKent Sir, ’tis my occupation to be plain:\n\nI have seen better faces in my time\n\nThan stands on any shoulder that I see\n\nBefore me at this instant.\n\nCornwall This is some fellow,\n\nWho, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect\n\nA saucy roughness, and constrains the garb\n\nQuite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,\n\nAn honest mind and plain, he must speak truth:\n\nAnd they will take it, so; if not, he’s plain.\n\nThese kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness\n\nHarbour more craft and more corrupter ends\n\nThan twenty silly ducking observants,\n\nThat stretch their duties nicely.\n\nKent Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,\n\nUnder th’ allowance of your great aspect,\n\nWhose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire\n\nOn flickering Phoebus’ front –\n\nCornwall What mean’st by this?\n\nKent To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so\n\nmuch. I know, sir, I am no flatterer: he that beguiled you in\n\na plain accent was a plain knave; which for my part I will not\n\nbe, though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to’t.\n\nCornwall What was the offence you gave him?\n\nOswald I never gave him any:\n\nIt pleased the King his master very late\n\nTo strike at me, upon his misconstruction;\n\nWhen he, compact, and flattering his displeasure,\n\nTripped me behind; being down, insulted, railed,\n\nAnd put upon him such a deal of man,\n\nThat worthied him, got praises of the King\n\nFor him attempting who was self-subdued;\n\nAnd, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,\n\nDrew on me here again.\n\nKent None of these rogues and cowards\n\nBut Ajax is their fool.\n\nCornwall Fetch forth the stocks!\n\nYou stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,\n\nWe’ll teach you.\n\nKent Sir, I am too old to learn.\n\nCall not your stocks for me; I serve the King,\n\nOn whose employment I was sent to you;\n\nYou shall do small respect, show too bold malice\n\nAgainst the grace and person of my master,\n\nStocking his messenger.\n\nCornwall Fetch forth the stocks!\n\nAs I have life and honour, there shall he sit till noon.\n\nRegan Till noon! Till night, my lord; and all night too.\n\nKent Why, madam, if I were your father’s dog,\n\nYou should not use me so.\n\nRegan Sir, being his knave, I will.\n\nCornwall This is a fellow of the self-same colour\n\nOur sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks.\n\n[ Stocks brought out ]\n\nGloucester Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.\n\nHis fault is much, and the good King his master\n\nWill check him for’t: your purposed low correction\n\nIs such as basest and contemned’st wretches\n\nFor pilferings and most common trespasses\n\nAre punished with: the King must take it ill,\n\nThat he, so slightly valued in his messenger,\n\nShould have him thus restrained.\n\nCornwall I’ll answer that.\n\nRegan My sister may receive it much more worse\n\nTo have her gentleman abused, assaulted,\n\nFor following her affairs. Put in his legs.\n\n[ Kent  is put in the stocks ]\n\nCornwall Come, my lord, away.\n\n[ Exeunt all but  Gloucester  and  Kent ]\n\nGloucester I am sorry for thee, friend; ’tis the Duke’s\n\npleasure,\n\nWhose disposition, all the world well knows,\n\nWill not be rubbed nor stopped: I’ll entreat for thee.\n\nKent Pray, do not, sir. I have watched and travelled hard;\n\nSome time I shall sleep out, the rest I’ll whistle.\n\nA good man’s fortune may grow out at heels:\n\nGive you good morrow!\n\nGloucester The Duke’s to blame in this; ’twill be ill taken.\n\n[ Exit ]\n\nKent Good King, that must approve the common saw,\n\nThou out of heaven’s benediction comest\n\nTo the warm sun!\n\nApproach, thou beacon to this under globe,\n\nThat by thy comfortable beams I may\n\nPeruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles,\n\nBut misery: I know ’tis from Cordelia,\n\nWho hath most fortunately been informed\n\nOf my obscured course; and shall find time\n\nFrom this enormous state, seeking to give\n\nLosses their remedies.

No port is free; no place\n\nThat guard, and most unusual vigilance,\n\nDoes not attend my taking. Whiles I may ’scape,\n\nI will preserve myself; and am bethought\n\nTo take the basest and most poorest shape\n\nThat ever penury, in contempt of man,\n\nBrought near to beast; my face I’ll grime with filth,\n\nBlanket my loins, elf all my hairs in knots,\n\nAnd with presented nakedness outface\n\nThe winds and persecutions of the sky.\n\nThe country gives me proof and precedent\n\nOf Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,\n\nStrike in their numbed and mortified bare arms\n\nPins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;\n\nAnd with this horrible object, from low farms,\n\nPoor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,\n\nSometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,\n\nEnforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! Poor Tom!\n\nThat’s something yet: Edgar I nothing am.\n\n[ Exit ]\n\nScene 4\n\nBefore Gloucester’s castle . Kent  in the stocks.

He wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by the\n\nheads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by the loins,\n\nand men by the legs: when a man’s over-lusty at legs then\n\nhe wears wooden nether-stocks.\n\nLear What’s he that hath so much thy place mistook\n\nTo set thee here?\n\nKent It is both he and she,\n\nYour son and daughter.\n\nLear No.\n\nKent Yes.\n\nLear No, I say.\n\nKent I say, yea.\n\nLear No, no; they would not.\n\nKent Yes, yes, they have.\n\nLear By Jupiter, I swear, no.\n\nKent By Juno, I swear, ay.\n\nLear They durst not do’t.\n\nThey could not, would not do’t; ’tis worse than murder,\n\nTo do upon respect such violent outrage.\n\nResolve me, with all modest haste, which way\n\nThou might’st deserve, or they impose, this usage,\n\nComing from us.\n\nKent My lord, when at their home\n\nI did commend your Highness’ letters to them,\n\nEre I was risen from the place that showed\n\nMy duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,\n\nStewed in his haste, half breathless, panting forth\n\nFrom Goneril his mistress salutations;\n\nDelivered letters, spite of intermission,\n\nWhich presently they read: on whose contents\n\nThey summoned up their meiny, straight took horse;\n\nCommanded me to follow, and attend\n\nThe leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:\n\nAnd meeting here the other messenger,\n\nWhose welcome, I perceived, had poisoned mine –\n\nBeing the very fellow which of late\n\nDisplay’d so saucily against your Highness –\n\nHaving more man than wit about me, drew:\n\nHe raised the house with loud and coward cries.\n\nYour son and daughter found this trespass worth\n\nThe shame which here it suffers.\n\nFool Winter’s not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way.\n\nFathers that wear rags\n\nDo make their children blind,\n\nBut fathers that bear bags\n\nShall see their children kind.\n\nFortune, that arrant whore,\n\nNe’er turns the key to the poor,\n\nBut for all this thou shalt have as many dolours for thy\n\ndaughters as thou canst tell in a year.\n\nLear O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!\n\nHysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow;\n\nThy element’s below.

I have hope\n\nYou less know how to value her desert\n\nThan she to scant her duty.\n\nLear Say? How is that?\n\nRegan I cannot think my sister in the least\n\nWould fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance\n\nShe have restrained the riots of your followers,\n\n’Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,\n\nAs clears her from all blame.\n\nLear My curses on her!\n\nRegan O sir, you are old;\n\nNature in you stands on the very verge\n\nOf her confine: you should be ruled and led\n\nBy some discretion that discerns your state\n\nBetter than you yourself. Therefore I pray you\n\nThat to our sister you do make return;\n\nSay you have wronged her.\n\nLear Ask her forgiveness?\n\nDo you but mark how this becomes the house:\n\n[ Kneeling ] ‘Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;\n\nAge is unnecessary: on my knees I beg\n\nThat you’ll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.’\n\nRegan Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks.\n\nReturn you to my sister.\n\nLear Never, Regan.\n\nShe hath abated me of half my train;\n\nLooked black upon me; struck me with her tongue,\n\nMost serpent-like, upon the very heart.\n\nAll the stored vengeances of heaven fall\n\nOn her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,\n\nYou taking airs, with lameness!\n\nCornwall Fie, sir, fie!\n\nLear You nimble lightnings, dart you blinding flames\n\nInto her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,\n\nYou fen-sucked fogs, drawn by the powerful sun\n\nTo fall and blast her pride!\n\nRegan O the blest gods! So will you wish on me,\n\nWhen the rash mood is on.\n\nLear No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:\n\nThy tender-hefted nature shall not give\n\nThee o’ er to harshness: her eyes are fierce, but thine\n\nDo comfort and not burn. ’Tis not in thee\n\nTo grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,\n\nTo bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,\n\nAnd in conclusion to oppose the bolt\n\nAgainst my coming in: thou better know’st\n\nThe offices of nature, bond of childhood,\n\nEffects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;\n\nThy half o’ th’ kingdom hast thou not forgot,\n\nWherein I thee endowed.\n\nRegan Good sir, to th’ purpose.\n\nLear Who put my man i’ th’ stocks?

How came my man i’ th’ stocks?\n\nCornwall I set him there, sir; but his own disorders\n\nDeserved much less advancement.\n\nLear You! Did you?\n\nRegan I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.\n\nIf, till the expiration of your month,\n\nYou will return and sojourn with my sister,\n\nDismissing half your train, come then to me:\n\nI am now from home, and out of that provision\n\nWhich shall be needful for your entertainment.\n\nLear Return to her? And fifty men dismissed?\n\nNo, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose\n\nTo wage against the enmity o’ th’ air;\n\nTo be a comrade with the wolf and owl,\n\nNecessity’s sharp pinch! Return with her!\n\nWhy, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took\n\nOur youngest born, I could as well be brought\n\nTo knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg\n\nTo keep base life afoot.

But I’ll not chide thee;\n\nLet shame come when it will, I do not call it;\n\nI do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,\n\nNor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.\n\nMend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure;\n\nI can be patient; I can stay with Regan,\n\nI and my hundred knights.\n\nRegan Not altogether so;\n\nI looked not for you yet, nor am provided\n\nFor your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;\n\nFor those that mingle reason with your passion\n\nMust be content to think you old, and so –\n\nBut she knows what she does.\n\nLear Is this well spoken?\n\nRegan I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?\n\nIs it not well? What should you need of more?\n\nYea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger\n\nSpeak ’gainst so great a number? How, in one house,\n\nShould many people, under two commands,\n\nHold amity? ’Tis hard; almost impossible.\n\nGoneril Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance\n\nFrom those that she calls servants, or from mine?\n\nRegan Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,\n\nWe could control them. If you will come to me,\n\nFor now I spy a danger, I entreat you\n\nTo bring but five-and-twenty; to no more\n\nWill I give place or notice.\n\nLear I gave you all –\n\nRegan And in good time you gave it.\n\nLear Made you my guardians, my depositaries,\n\nBut kept a reservation to be followed\n\nWith such a number. What, must I come to you\n\nWith five-and-twenty? Regan, said you so?\n\nRegan And speak’t again, my lord; no more with me.\n\nLear Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favoured\n\nWhen others are more wicked; not being the worst\n\nStands in some rank of praise. [ To  Goneril ] I’ll go with\n\nthee:\n\nThy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,\n\nAnd thou art twice her love.\n\nGoneril Hear me, my lord:\n\nWhat need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,\n\nTo follow in a house where twice so many\n\nHave a command to tend you?\n\nRegan What need one?\n\nLear O, reason not the need; our basest beggars\n\nAre in the poorest thing superfluous:\n\nAllow not nature more than nature needs,\n\nMan’s life’s as cheap as beast’s. Thou art a lady;\n\nIf only to go warm were gorgeous,\n\nWhy, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear’st,\n\nWhich scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need –\n\nYou heavens, give me that patience, patience I need! –\n\nYou see me here, you gods, a poor old man,\n\nAs full of grief as age; wretched in both!\n\nIf it be you that stirs these daughters’ hearts\n\nAgainst their father, fool me not so much\n\nTo bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,\n\nAnd let not women’s weapons, water-drops,\n\nStain my man’s cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,\n\nI will have such revenges on you both\n\nThat all the world shall – I will do such things,\n\nWhat they are, yet I know not, but they shall be\n\nThe terrors of the earth. You think I’ll weep;\n\nNo, I’ll not weep:\n\nI have full cause of weeping, but this heart\n\nShall break into a hundred thousand flaws\n\nOr ere I’ll weep. O Fool!

Where’s the King?\n\nGentleman Contending with the fretful elements;\n\nBids the wind blow the earth into the sea,\n\nOr swell the curled waters ’bove the main,\n\nThat things might change or cease; tears his white hair,\n\nWhich the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,\n\nCatch in their fury, and make nothing of;\n\nStrives in his little world of man to out-scorn\n\nThe to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.\n\nThis night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,\n\nThe lion and the belly-pinched wolf\n\nKeep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,\n\nAnd bids what will take all.\n\nKent But who is with him?\n\nGentleman None but the Fool, who labours to out-jest\n\nHis heart-struck injuries.\n\nKent Sir, I do know you;\n\nAnd dare, upon the warrant of my note,\n\nCommend a dear thing to you. There is division,\n\nAlthough as yet the face of it is covered\n\nWith mutual cunning, ’twixt Albany and Cornwall;\n\nWho have – as who have not, that their great stars\n\nThroned and set high? – servants, who seem no less,\n\nWhich are to France the spies and speculations\n\nIntelligent of our state; what hath been seen,\n\nEither in snuffs and packings of the Dukes,\n\nOr the hard rein which both of them have borne\n\nAgainst the old kind King; or something deeper,\n\nWhereof perchance these are but furnishings;\n\nBut, true it is, from France there comes a power\n\nInto this scattered kingdom; who already,\n\nWise in our negligence, have secret feet\n\nIn some of our best ports, and are at point\n\nTo show their open banner. Now to you:\n\nIf on my credit you dare build so far\n\nTo make your speed to Dover, you shall find\n\nSome that will thank you, making just report\n\nOf how unnatural and bemadding sorrow\n\nThe King hath cause to plain.\n\nI am a gentleman of blood and breeding,\n\nAnd from some knowledge and assurance offer\n\nThis office to you.\n\nGentleman I will talk further with you.\n\nKent No, do not.\n\nFor confirmation that I am much more\n\nThan my out-wall, open this purse and take\n\nWhat it contains. If you shall see Cordelia –\n\nAs fear not but you shall – show her this ring,\n\nAnd she will tell you who that fellow is\n\nThat yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!\n\nI will go seek the King.\n\nGentleman Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?\n\nKent Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;\n\nThat, when we have found the King – in which your pain\n\nThat way, I’ll this – he that first lights on him\n\nHolla the other.\n\n[ Exeunt severally ]\n\nScene 2\n\nAnother part of the heath.

And thou, all-shaking thunder,\n\nStrike flat the thick rotundity o’ th’ world!\n\nCrack nature’s moulds, all germens spill at once\n\nThat makes ingrateful man!\n\nFool O nuncle, court holy-water in a dry house is better\n\nthan this rain-water out o’ door.

There is division\n\nbetween the Dukes, and a worse matter than that. I have\n\nreceived a letter this night; ’tis dangerous to be spoken; I\n\nhave locked the letter in my closet. These injuries the King\n\nnow bears will be revenged home; there is part of a power\n\nalready footed; we must incline to the King.

Whom the foul\n\nfiend hath led through fire and through flame, through ford\n\nand whirlpool, o’ er bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives\n\nunder his pillow, and halters in his pew; set ratsbane by his\n\nporridge; made him proud of heart, to ride on a bay\n\ntrotting-horse over four-inched bridges, to course his own\n\nshadow for a traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom’s a-cold. O,\n\ndo de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-\n\nblasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some charity, whom the\n\nfoul fiend vexes. There could I have him now, and there,\n\nand there again, and there.\n\nLear What! have his daughters brought him to this pass?\n\nCould’st thou save nothing? Would’st thou give ’em all?\n\nFool Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all\n\nshamed.\n\nLear Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air\n\nHang fated o’ er men’s faults light on thy daughters!\n\nKent He hath no daughters, sir.\n\nLear Death, traitor!

Obey thy parents: keep\n\nthy word justly; swear not; commit not with man’s sworn\n\nspouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud array. Tom’s a-cold.\n\nLear What hast thou been?\n\nEdgar A servingman, proud in heart and mind; that curled\n\nmy hair, wore gloves in my cap, served the lust of my\n\nmistress’ heart, and did the act of darkness with her; swore\n\nas many oaths as I spake words, and broke them in the\n\nsweet face of Heaven; one that slept in the contriving of\n\nlust, and waked to do it. Wine loved I deeply, dice dearly,\n\nand in woman out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light\n\nof ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in\n\ngreediness, dog in madness, lion in prey. Let not the\n\ncreaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy poor\n\nheart to woman: keep thy foot out of brothels, thy hand out\n\nof plackets, thy pen from lenders’ books, and defy the foul\n\nfiend.

Dolphin my boy, boy; sessa! let\n\nhim trot by.\n\nLear Thou wert better in a grave than to answer with thy\n\nuncovered body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more\n\nthan this?

Ha! here’s three on ’s are sophisticated; thou art\n\nthe thing itself; unaccommodated man is no more but such a\n\npoor, bare, forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings!\n\nCome; unbutton here. [ Tearing off his clothes ]\n\nFool Prithee, nuncle, be contented; ’tis a naughty night to\n\nswim in.

What is’t you seek?\n\nGloucester What are you there? Your names?\n\nEdgar Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the\n\ntadpole, the wall-newt, and the water; that in the fury of his\n\nheart, when the foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for sallets;\n\nswallows the old rat and the ditch-dog; drinks the green\n\nmantle of the standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to\n\ntithing, and stock-punished, and imprisoned; who hath had\n\nthree suits to his back, six shirts to his body, horse to ride,\n\nand weapon to wear,\n\nBut mice and rats and such small deer,\n\nHave been Tom’s food for seven long year.\n\nBeware my follower.

My duty cannot suffer\n\nT’obey in all your daughters’ hard commands;\n\nThough their injunction be to bar my doors,\n\nAnd let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,\n\nYet I have ventured to come and seek you out\n\nAnd bring you where both fire and food is ready.\n\nLear First let me talk with this philosopher.\n\nWhat is the cause of thunder?\n\nKent Good my lord, take his offer; go into the house.\n\nLear I’ll talk a word with this same learned Theban.\n\nWhat is your study?\n\nEdgar How to prevent the fiend, and to kill vermin.\n\nLear Let me ask you one word in private.\n\nKent Importune him once more to go, my lord;\n\nHis wits begin t’unsettle.\n\nGloucester Canst thou blame him?\n\nHis daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent;\n\nHe said it would be thus, poor banished man!\n\nThou say’st the King grows mad; I’ll tell thee, friend,\n\nI am almost mad myself. I had a son,\n\nNow outlawed from my blood; he sought my life,\n\nBut lately, very late; I loved him, friend,\n\nNo father his son dearer; truth to tell thee,\n\nThe grief hath crazed my wits.

Our wishes on the way\n\nMay prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;\n\nHasten his musters and conduct his powers:\n\nI must change arms at home, and give the distaff\n\nInto my husband’s hands. This trusty servant\n\nShall pass between us; ere long you are like to hear,\n\nIf you dare venture on your own behalf,\n\nA mistress’s command. Wear this; spare speech;\n\nDecline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,\n\nWould stretch thy spirits up into the air.\n\nConceive, and fare thee well.\n\nEdmund Yours in the ranks of death.\n\nGoneril My most dear Gloucester!\n\n[ Exit  Edmund ]\n\nO, the difference of man and man!\n\nTo thee a woman’s services are due:\n\nA fool usurps my bed.\n\nOswald Madam, here comes my lord.\n\n[ Exit ]\n\n[ Enter  Albany ]\n\nGoneril I have been worth the whistle.\n\nAlbany O Goneril!\n\nYou are not worth the dust which the rude wind\n\nBlows in your face. I fear your disposition:\n\nThat nature, which contemns its origin,\n\nCannot be bordered certain in itself;\n\nShe that herself will sliver and disbranch\n\nFrom her material sap, perforce must wither\n\nAnd come to deadly use.\n\nGoneril No more; the text is foolish.\n\nAlbany Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;\n\nFilths savour but themselves. What have you done?\n\nTigers, not daughters, what have you performed?\n\nA father, and a gracious aged man,\n\nWhose reverence even the head-lugged bear would lick,\n\nMost barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded.\n\nCould my good brother suffer you to do it?\n\nA man, a prince, by him so benefited!\n\nIf that the heavens do not their visible spirits\n\nSend quickly down to tame these vile offences,\n\nIt will come,\n\nHumanity must perforce prey on itself,\n\nLike monsters of the deep.\n\nGoneril Milk-livered man!\n\nThat bear’st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;\n\nWho hast not in thy brows an eye discerning\n\nThine honour from thy suffering; that not know’st\n\nFools do those villains pity who are punished\n\nEre they have done their mischief. Where’s thy drum?\n\nFrance spreads his banners in our noiseless land,\n\nWith plumed helm thy state begins to threat,\n\nWhilst thou, a moral fool, sits still, and cries\n\n‘Alack! why does he so?’\n\nAlbany See thyself, devil!\n\nProper deformity shows not in the fiend\n\nSo horrid as in woman.\n\nGoneril O vain fool!\n\nAlbany Thou changed and self-covered thing, for shame,\n\nBe-monster not thy feature. Were’t my fitness\n\nTo let these hands obey my blood,\n\nThey are apt enough to dislocate and tear\n\nThy flesh and bones; howe’ er thou art a fiend,\n\nA woman’s shape doth shield thee.\n\nGoneril Marry, your manhood mew –\n\n[ Enter a  Messenger ]\n\nAlbany What news?\n\nMessenger O my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall’s dead;\n\nSlain by his servant, going to put out\n\nThe other eye of Gloucester.\n\nAlbany Gloucester’s eyes!\n\nMessenger A servant that he bred, thrilled with remorse,\n\nOpposed against the act, bending his sword\n\nTo his great master: who, thereat enraged,\n\nFlew on him, and amongst them felled him dead;\n\nBut not without that harmful stroke, which since\n\nHath plucked him after.\n\nAlbany This shows you are above,\n\nYou justicers, that these our nether crimes\n\nSo speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!\n\nLost he his other eye?\n\nMessenger Both, both, my lord.\n\nThis letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;\n\n’Tis from your sister.\n\nGoneril [ aside ] One way I like this well;\n\nBut being widow, and my Gloucester with her,\n\nMay all the building in my fancy pluck\n\nUpon my hateful life: another way,\n\nThe news is not so tart.

Come hither, friend:\n\nTell me what more thou know’st.\n\n[ Exeunt ]\n\nScene 3\n\nThe French camp near Dover. Enter  Kent  and a  Gentleman.\n\nKent Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know\n\nyou the reason?\n\nGentleman Something he left imperfect in the state, which\n\nsince his coming forth is thought of; which imports to the\n\nkingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return\n\nwas most required and necessary.\n\nKent Who hath he left behind him general?\n\nGentleman The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.\n\nKent Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration\n\nof grief?\n\nGentleman Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;\n\nAnd now and then an ample tear trilled down\n\nHer delicate cheek; it seemed she was a queen\n\nOver her passion; who, most rebel-like,\n\nSought to be king o’ er her.\n\nKent O, then, it moved her.\n\nGentleman Not to a rage; patience and sorrow strove\n\nWho should express her goodliest. You have seen\n\nSunshine and rain at once; her smiles and tears\n\nWere like, a better way; those happy smilets\n\nThat played on her ripe lip seemed not to know\n\nWhat guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,\n\nAs pearls from diamonds dropped. In brief,\n\nSorrow would be a rarity most beloved,\n\nIf all could so become it.\n\nKent Made she no verbal question?\n\nGentleman Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of\n\n‘father’\n\nPantingly forth, as if it pressed her heart;\n\nCried ‘Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!\n\nKent! father! sisters! What, i’ th’ storm! i’ th’ night?\n\nLet pity not believe it!’ There she shook\n\nThe holy water from her heavenly eyes,\n\nAnd clamour moistened, then away she started\n\nTo deal with grief alone.\n\nKent It is the stars,\n\nThe stars above us, govern our conditions;\n\nElse one self mate and make could not beget\n\nSuch different issues. You spoke not with her since?\n\nGentleman No.\n\nKent Was this before the King returned?\n\nGentleman No, since.\n\nKent Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear’s i’ th’ town;\n\nWho sometime, in his better tune, remembers\n\nWhat we are come about, and by no means\n\nWill yield to see his daughter.\n\nGentleman Why, good sir?\n\nKent A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,\n\nThat stripped her from his benediction, turned her\n\nTo foreign casualties, gave her dear rights\n\nTo his dog-hearted daughters: these things sting\n\nHis mind so venomously that burning shame\n\nDetains him from Cordelia.\n\nGentleman Alack, poor gentleman!\n\nKent Of Albany’s and Cornwall’s powers you heard not?\n\nGentleman ’Tis so, they are afoot.\n\nKent Well, sir, I’ll bring you to our master Lear,\n\nAnd leave you to attend him. Some dear cause\n\nWill in concealment wrap me up awhile;\n\nWhen I am known aright, you shall not grieve\n\nLending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go\n\nAlong with me.\n\n[ Exeunt ]\n\nScene 4\n\nThe same. Enter , with drum and colours , Cordelia, Doctor,  and Soldiers.\n\nCordelia Alack, ’tis he: why, he was met even now\n\nAs mad as the vexed sea; singing aloud;\n\nCrowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,\n\nWith hardocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,\n\nDarnel, and all the idle weeds that grow\n\nIn our sustaining corn. A century send forth;\n\nSearch every acre in the high-grown field,\n\nAnd bring him to our eye.

Seek, seek for him,\n\nLest this ungoverned rage dissolve the life\n\nThat wants the means to lead it.\n\n[ Enter a  Messenger ]\n\nMessenger News, madam;\n\nThe British powers are marching hitherward.\n\nCordelia ’Tis known before; our preparation stands\n\nIn expectation of them. O dear father!\n\nIt is thy business that I go about;\n\nTherefore great France\n\nMy mourning and importuned tears hath pitied.\n\nNo blown ambition doth our arms incite,\n\nBut love, dear love, and our aged father’s right.\n\nSoon may I hear and see him!\n\n[ Exeunt ]\n\nScene 5\n\nGloucester’s castle.

Edmund, I think, is gone,\n\nIn pity of his misery, to dispatch\n\nHis nighted life; moreover, to descry\n\nThe strength o ’th’ enemy.\n\nOswald I needs must after him, madam, with my letter.\n\nRegan Our troops set forth to-morrow; stay with us,\n\nThe ways are dangerous.\n\nOswald I may not, madam;\n\nMy lady charged my duty in this business.\n\nRegan Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you\n\nTransport her purposes by word? Belike,\n\nSomething – I know not what: I’ll love thee much,\n\nLet me unseal the letter.\n\nOswald Madam, I had rather –\n\nRegan I know your lady does not love her husband;\n\nI am sure of that; and at her late being here\n\nShe gave strange eliads and most speaking looks\n\nTo noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.\n\nOswald I, madam!\n\nRegan I speak in understanding: y’are, I know’t:\n\nTherefore I do advise you, take this note:\n\nMy lord is dead; Edmund and I have talked;\n\nAnd more convenient is he for my hand\n\nThan for your lady’s. You may gather more.\n\nIf you do find him, pray you give him this,\n\nAnd when your mistress hears thus much from you,\n\nI pray desire her call her wisdom to her:\n\nSo, fare you well.\n\nIf you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,\n\nPreferment falls on him that cuts him off.\n\nOswald Would I could meet him, madam: I should show\n\nWhat party I do follow.\n\nRegan Fare thee well.\n\n[ Exeunt ]\n\nScene 6\n\nThe country near Dover. Enter  Gloucester,  and  Edgar  dressed like a peasant.\n\nGloucester When shall I come to the top of that same hill?\n\nEdgar You do climb up it now; look how we labour.\n\nGloucester Methinks the ground is even.\n\nEdgar Horrible steep.\n\nHark! Do you hear the sea?\n\nGloucester No, truly.\n\nEdgar Why, then your other senses grow imperfect\n\nBy your eyes’ anguish.\n\nGloucester So may it be, indeed.\n\nMethinks thy voice is altered, and thou speak’st\n\nIn better phrase and matter than thou didst.\n\nEdgar You’re much deceived; in nothing am I changed\n\nBut in my garments.\n\nGloucester Methinks you’re better spoken.\n\nEdgar Come on, sir; here’s the place: stand still. How fearful\n\nAnd dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low!\n\nThe crows and choughs that wing the midway air\n\nShow scarce so gross as beetles; halfway down\n\nHangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!\n\nMethinks he seems no bigger than his head.\n\nThe fishermen that walk upon the beach\n\nAppear like mice, and yond tall anchoring bark\n\nDiminished to her cock; her cock a buoy\n\nAlmost too small for sight. The murmuring surge,\n\nThat on the unnumbered idle pebbles chafes,\n\nCannot be heard so high. I’ll look no more,\n\nLest my brain turn, and the deficient sight\n\nTopple down headlong.\n\nGloucester Set me where you stand.\n\nEdgar Give me your hand; you are now within a foot\n\nOf the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon\n\nWould I not leap upright.\n\nGloucester Let go my hand.\n\nHere, friend, ’s another purse; in it a jewel\n\nWell worth a poor man’s taking: fairies and gods\n\nProsper it with thee! Go thou further off;\n\nBid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.\n\nEdgar Now fare ye well, good sir.\n\nGloucester With all my heart.\n\nEdgar [ aside ] Why I do trifle thus with his despair\n\nIs done to cure it.\n\nGloucester [ kneeling ] O you mighty gods!\n\nThis world I do renounce, and in your sights\n\nShake patiently my great affliction off;\n\nIf I could bear it longer, and not fall\n\nTo quarrel with your great opposeless wills,\n\nMy snuff and loathed part of nature should\n\nBurn itself out. If Edgar live, O bless him!\n\nNow, fellow, fare thee well.\n\n[ He falls forward ]\n\nEdgar Gone, sir: farewell.\n\nAnd yet I know how conceit may rob\n\nThe treasury of life when life itself\n\nYields to the theft; had he been where he thought\n\nBy this had thought been past. Alive or dead?\n\nHo, you sir! Friend! Hear you, sir! Speak!\n\nThus might he pass indeed; yet he revives.\n\nWhat are you, sir?\n\nGloucester Away, and let me die.\n\nEdgar Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,\n\nSo many fathom down precipitating,\n\nThou’ dst shivered like an egg; but thou dost breathe,\n\nHast heavy substance, bleed’ st not, speak’ st, art sound.\n\nTen masts at each make not the altitude\n\nWhich thou hast perpendicularly fell:\n\nThy life’s a miracle. Speak yet again.\n\nGloucester But have I fallen or no?\n\nEdgar From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.\n\nLook up a-height: the shrill-gorged lark so far\n\nCannot be seen or heard: do but look up.\n\nGloucester Alack! I have no eyes.\n\nIs wretchedness deprived that benefit\n\nTo end itself by death? ’Twas yet some comfort,\n\nWhen misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage,\n\nAnd frustrate his proud will.\n\nEdgar Give me your arm:\n\nUp: so; how is’t? Feel you your legs? You stand.\n\nGloucester Too well, too well.\n\nEdgar This is above all strangeness.\n\nUpon the crown o’ th’ cliff what thing was that\n\nWhich parted from you?\n\nGloucester A poor unfortunate beggar.\n\nEdgar As I stood here below, methought his eyes\n\nWere two full moons; he had a thousand noses,\n\nHorns whelked and waved like the enridged sea:\n\nIt was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,\n\nThink that the clearest gods, who make them honours\n\nOf men’s impossibilities, have preserved thee.\n\nGloucester I do remember now; henceforth I’ll bear\n\nAffliction till it do cry out itself\n\n‘Enough, enough,’ and die. That thing you speak of\n\nI took it for a man; often ’twould say\n\n‘The fiend, the fiend’: he led me to that place.\n\nEdgar Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?\n\n[ Enter  Lear,  fantastically dressed with wild flowers ]\n\nThe safer sense will ne’ er accommodate\n\nHis master thus.\n\nLear No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the King\n\nhimself.\n\nEdgar O, thou side-piercing sight!\n\nLear Nature’s above art in that respect. There’s your press-\n\nmoney. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper: draw\n\nme a clothier’s yard. Look, look! a mouse. Peace, peace! This\n\npiece of toasted cheese will do’t. There’s my gauntlet; I’ll\n\nprove it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. Oh, well flown\n\nbird; i’ th’ clouts i’ th’ clout: hewgh! Give the word.\n\nEdgar Sweet marjoram.\n\nLear Pass.\n\nGloucester I know that voice.\n\nLear Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered me\n\nlike a dog, and told me I had the white hairs in my beard ere\n\nthe black ones were there. To say ‘ay’ and ‘no’ to every thing\n\nthat I said! ‘Ay’ and ‘no’ too was no good divinity. When the\n\nrain came to wet me once and the wind to make me chatter,\n\nwhen the thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I\n\nfound ’em, there I smelt ’em out. Go to, they are not men\n\no’ their words: they told me I was every thing; ’tis a lie, I am\n\nnot ague-proof.\n\nGloucester The trick of that voice I do well remember:\n\nIs’t not the King?\n\nLear Ay, every inch a king:\n\nWhen I do stare, see how the subject quakes.\n\nI pardon that man’s life. What was thy cause?\n\nAdultery?\n\nThou shalt not die; die for adultery! No:\n\nThe wren goes to’t, and the small gilded fly\n\nDoes lecher in my sight.\n\nLet copulation thrive; for Gloucester’s bastard son\n\nWas kinder to his father than my daughters\n\nGot ’tween the lawful sheets.\n\nTo’t, luxury, pell-mell! For I lack soldiers.\n\nBehold yond simp’ring dame,\n\nWhose face between her forks presages snow;\n\nThat minces virtue, and does shake the head\n\nTo hear of pleasure’s name;\n\nThe fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to’t\n\nWith a more riotous appetite.\n\nDown from the waist they are Centaurs,\n\nThough women all above:\n\nBut to the girdle do the gods inherit,\n\nBeneath is all the fiends’: there’s hell, there’s darkness,\n\nThere is the sulphurous pit, burning, scalding,\n\nStench, consumption; fie, fie, fie! pah, pah!\n\nGive me an ounce of civet, good apothecary,\n\nTo sweeten my imagination.\n\nThere’s money for thee.\n\nGloucester O, let me kiss that hand.\n\nLear Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.\n\nGloucester O ruined piece of nature! This great world\n\nShall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?\n\nLear I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny\n\nat me?\n\nNo, do thy worst, blind Cupid; I’ll not love.\n\nRead thou this challenge; mark but the penning of it.\n\nGloucester Were all thy letters suns, I could not see.\n\nEdgar [ aside ] I would not take this from report; it is,\n\nAnd my heart breaks at it.\n\nLear Read.\n\nGloucester What, with the case of eyes?\n\nLear O, ho! are you there with me? No eyes in your head,\n\nnor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case,\n\nyour purse in a light: yet you see how this world goes.\n\nGloucester I see it feelingly.\n\nLear What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes\n\nwith no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond justice rails\n\nupon simple thief. Hark, in thine ear: change places,\n\nand, handy-dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief?\n\nThou hast seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar?\n\nGloucester Ay, sir.\n\nLear And the creature run from the cur? There thou\n\nmight’st behold\n\nThe great image of Authority:\n\nA dog’s obeyed in office.\n\nThou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!\n\nWhy dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;\n\nThou hotly lusts to use her in that kind\n\nFor which thou whip’st her. The usurer hangs the\n\ncozener.\n\nThrough tattered clothes small vices do appear;\n\nRobes and furred gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,\n\nAnd the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:\n\nArm it in rags, a pigmy’s straw does pierce it.\n\nNone does offend, none, I say, none; I’ll able ’em:\n\nTake that of me, my friend, who have the power\n\nTo seal the accuser’s lips. Get thee glass eyes;\n\nAnd, like a scurvy politician, seem\n\nTo see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now;\n\nPull off my boots; harder, harder; so.\n\nEdgar [ aside ] O, matter and impertinency mixed;\n\nReason in madness.\n\nLear If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes;\n\nI know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester;\n\nThou must be patient; we came crying hither:\n\nThou know’st the first time that we smell the air\n\nWe wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.\n\nGloucester Alack, alack the day!\n\nLear When we are born, we cry that we are come\n\nTo this great stage of fools. This’ s a good block!\n\nIt were a delicate stratagem to shoe\n\nA troop of horse with felt; I’ll put’ t in proof,\n\nAnd when I have stolen upon these sons-in-law,\n\nThen, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!\n\n[ Enter a  Gentleman,  with Attendants ]\n\nGentleman O, here he is; lay hand upon him.

Let me have surgeons;\n\nI am cut to the brains.\n\nGentleman You shall have any thing.\n\nLear No seconds? All myself?\n\nWhy this would make a man a man of salt,\n\nTo use his eyes for garden water-pots,\n\nAy, and laying autumn’s dust. I will die bravely,\n\nLike a smug bridegroom. What! I will be jovial:\n\nCome, come; I am a king, masters, know you that?\n\nGentleman You are a royal one, and we obey you.\n\nLear Then there’s life in’t.

All’s cheerless, dark, and deadly:\n\nYour eldest daughters have fordone themselves,\n\nAnd desperately are dead.\n\nLear Ay, so I think.\n\nAlbany He knows not what he says, and vain is it\n\nThat we present us to him.\n\nEdgar Very bootless.\n\n[ Enter an  Officer ]\n\nOfficer Edmund is dead, my lord.\n\nAlbany That’s but a trifle here.\n\nYou lords and noble friends, know our intent;\n\nWhat comfort to this great decay may come\n\nShall be applied: for us, we will resign,\n\nDuring the life of this old majesty,\n\nTo him our absolute power: [ To  Edgar  and  Kent ]\n\nYou, to your rights,\n\nWith boot and such addition as your honours\n\nHave more than merited. All friends shall taste\n\nThe wages of their virtue, and all foes\n\nThe cup of their deservings. O, see, see!\n\nLear And my poor fool is hanged! No, no, no life!\n\nWhy should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,\n\nAnd thou no breath at all? Thou’lt come no more,\n\nNever, never, never, never, never!\n\nPray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.\n\nDo you see this?

My lord, my lord!\n\nKent Break, heart; I prithee, break!\n\nEdgar Look up, my lord.\n\nKent Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass; he hates him\n\nThat would upon the rack of this tough world\n\nStretch him out longer.\n\nEdgar He is gone, indeed.\n\nKent The wonder is he hath endured so long;\n\nHe but usurped his life.\n\nAlbany Bear them from hence. Our present business\n\nIs general woe. [ To  Kent  and  Edgar ] Friends of my soul,\n\nyou twain\n\nRule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.\n\nKent I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;\n\nMy master calls me, I must not say no.\n\nEdgar The weight of this sad time we must obey;\n\nSpeak what we feel, not what we ought to say.\n\nThe oldest hath borne most: we that are young\n\nShall never see so much, nor live so long.\n\n[ Exeunt, with a dead march ]\n\nModern Version\n\nAct one\n\nScene 1\n\nKing Lear’s palace. Enter the  Earl of Kent, followed by the Earl of Gloucester  and his illegitimate son  Edmund.  They are discussing court matters.\n\nKent I thought the King favored the Duke of Albany more\n\nthan the Duke of Cornwall.\n\nGloucester It always seemed so to us. But now that he has\n\ndivided up his kingdom, it isn’t clear which of the Dukes he\n\nvalues more. Their shares are so equal that neither is to be\n\npreferred to the other.\n\nKent [ indicating  Edmund ] Isn’t this your son, my lord?\n\nGloucester I fathered him, sir. I’ve so often been\n\nembarrassed to admit he’s mine that now I’m hardened\n\nto it.\n\nKent I cannot conceive why.\n\nGloucester Sir, this young fellow’s mother could! So she got\n\npregnant, and had a son for her cradle before she had a\n\nhusband for her bed. Do you detect a fault?\n\nKent I can’t wish the fault undone, the result of it being so\n\nhandsome!\n\nGloucester But I have a legitimate son, sir, about a year older\n\nthan this one, though I don’t make any distinction in his\n\nfavor. [ nodding toward  Edmund ] Though this fellow was\n\ncheeky enough to be born before he was sent for, there’s no\n\ndenying his mother was beautiful. We had a good time\n\nbegetting him, so the rascal can’t be disowned. Do you\n\nknow this noble gentleman, Edmund?\n\nEdmund No, my lord.\n\nGloucester [ introducing him formally ] The Lord of Kent.\n\nRegard him always as my honorable friend.\n\nEdmund [ bowing ] At your service, my lord.\n\nKent My love to you: I’d like to know you better.\n\nEdmund Sir, I’ll try to be worthy of your interest.\n\nGloucester He’s been soldiering abroad these last nine years,\n\nand he’ll be off again soon. [ The sound of trumpets is heard ]\n\nThe King is coming.\n\n[ A servant enters carrying a coronet, followed by  King Lear;\n\nthe Dukes of  Albany  and  Cornwall;  their wives  Goneril  and\n\nRegan,  two daughters of the King;  Cordelia,  Lear’s youngest\n\ndaughter; and members of the court. ]\n\nLear Bring in the Lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.\n\nGloucester I shall, my liege. [ He goes, followed by  Edmund ]\n\nLear Meanwhile we’ll reveal our plan. Give me that map,\n\nthere. [ Servants  hand him a large map of Britain. He\n\naddresses the court ] Be it known that we have divided our\n\nkingdom into three parts; and it is our firm intention to\n\nshake off all cares and responsibilities in our old age, and to\n\nconfer them on younger shoulders while we, freed of our\n\nburdens, crawl toward death. Our son-in-law Cornwall, and\n\nyou, our no less loving son-in-law Albany: we have resolved\n\nat this juncture to make public the various doweries of our\n\ndaughters, so that future strife can be prevented now. The\n\nKing of France and the Duke of Burgundy – keen rivals for\n\nthe hand of our youngest daughter – have for a long time\n\nresided at our court as suitors, and they are to have their\n\nanswer here. [ To  Goneril, Regan  and  Cordelia ] Tell me, my\n\ndaughters – since we shall now divest us of our throne, our\n\nterritorial possessions and our administrative\n\nresponsibilities – which of you shall we say is the one who\n\nloves us most? Then we can bestow our greatest generosity\n\nwhere natural affection most merits it. Goneril, our eldest\n\nchild, speak first.\n\nGoneril Sir, I love you more than words can express: dearer\n\nthan eyesight, freedom or independence; more than what is\n\nutterly priceless or rare; no less than life itself when it has\n\ndignity, health, beauty and honor; as much as a child ever\n\nloved or a father ever enjoyed affection; a love that makes\n\nwords weak and speech inadequate. Beyond all such\n\ncomparisons I love you.\n\nCordelia [ aside ] What shall Cordelia say? Just love, and be\n\nsilent …\n\nLear [ indicating the boundaries of  Goneril’s  legacy on the\n\nmap ] All this region – from this line here to this – rich with\n\nshady forests, fertile plains, teeming rivers and broad\n\nmeadows, we give you to rule. This is for you and your\n\nhusband Albany’s descendants forever. [ He turns to  Regan ]\n\nWhat has our second daughter to say, our dearest Regan,\n\nwife of the Duke of Cornwall? Speak.\n\nRegan I am made of the same metal as my sister, so value\n\nme as you have done her. From the bottom of my heart, I\n\nfind she describes my own love precisely, except that she\n\nunderstates it. No other pleasure appeals to me: my\n\nhappiness is solely in the enjoyment of your love.\n\nCordelia [ to herself ] Poor Cordelia, then! But not really so,\n\nbecause I’m sure my love is greater than my tongue can\n\nexpress.\n\nLear [ to  Regan ] To you and yours, in perpetuity, is bestowed\n\nthis extensive third of our fine kingdom: no smaller, less\n\nvaluable or pleasurable than that conferred on Goneril.\n\n[ Turning to  Cordelia ] Now our joy; last-born but not least; for\n\nwhose young love the vineyards of France and the pastures\n\nof Burgundy compete: What can you say to attract a third\n\nshare more valuable than that of your sisters? Speak.\n\nCordelia Nothing, my lord.\n\nLear Nothing?\n\nCordelia Nothing.\n\nLear Nothing begets nothing. Speak again.\n\nCordelia Wretched as I am, I can’t express in words what’s in\n\nmy heart. I love your Majesty according to my duty as a\n\ndaughter. No more, no less.\n\nLear [ his anger rising ] What, what Cordelia? Speak more\n\ntactfully, lest you spoil your chances!\n\nCordelia My good lord, you have fathered me, brought me up\n\nand loved me. I return those duties accordingly: I obey you,\n\nlove you, and honor you most. Why have my sisters got\n\nhusbands, if they say they love you absolutely? Be assured\n\nthat when I wed, the man who has my hand in marriage will\n\nhave half my love, half my care and duty. Certainly I’ll never\n\nmarry like my sisters, loving my father so totally.\n\nLear Is this spoken from the heart?\n\nCordelia Yes, my good lord.\n\nLear So young, yet so hard-hearted?\n\nCordelia So young, my lord, and truthful.\n\nLear Right, then: truth shall be your dowry! By the sun’s\n\nsacred beams, by the witch-queen’s magic rites at night, by\n\nall the stars that govern life and death: I here disclaim my\n\nfatherly affection, my kinship, my blood relationship! For\n\nevermore I shall regard you as a stranger to my heart and\n\nme. Barbarians like the Scythians, or those who eat their\n\nprogeny when they’re hungry, shall be as welcomed, pitied\n\nand given succor as you, my former daughter!\n\nKent Your Majesty –\n\nLear Silence, Kent! Don’t come between the dragon and the\n\nobject of his wrath! I loved her most, and planned to live\n\nwith her in my retirement. Go, get out of my sight! Death is\n\nmy only consolation, since here I give away a father’s love!\n\nCall the King of France. Quick now! Call Burgundy! Cornwall\n\nand Albany, to my two daughters’ dowries add this third\n\n[ pointing to  Cordelia’s  territory on the map ]. Let\n\npride – which she calls frankness – get her a husband. I\n\ninvest you jointly with my power, my absolute authority, and\n\nall the ceremony that goes with kingship. We shall live with\n\nyou alternately on a monthly basis, retaining the right to\n\nhave a hundred knights maintained at your expense. We’ll\n\nsimply retain the title and all the honors and prerogatives\n\ndue to a king. Policy, taxation, and all administrative\n\nmatters, beloved sons, will be yours. In confirmation, this\n\ncoronet is divided between you. [ The  Servant  presents it to\n\nthe  Dukes ]\n\nKent Royal Lear, whom I’ve always honored as my King,\n\nloved as if he were my father, followed as he is my master,\n\nmentioned in my prayers as my great patron –\n\nLear The bow is bent and drawn: keep clear of the arrow!\n\nKent Better to let it go, even though it pierces my heart! Kent\n\nmust be discourteous when Lear is mad. What are you\n\ndoing, old man? Do you think loyal men will fear to speak\n\nwhen those in power fall for flattery? Honor demands plain\n\nspeaking when kings descend to folly. Keep your kingdom,\n\nand think again; let this appalling rashness go no further. I’ll\n\nstake my life on it: your youngest daughter does not love\n\nyou least, nor are they heartless whose low-key speeches\n\ncontain no flattery.\n\nLear Kent, on your life, no more!\n\nKent I never considered my life as more than a mere pawn, to\n\nbe used against your enemies, nor do I fear losing it when\n\nyour safety is the issue.\n\nLear Out of my sight!\n\nKent See better, Lear, and let me – as ever – be clear-sighted\n\non your behalf!\n\nLear Now, by Apollo – !\n\nKent Now, by Apollo, King, you invoke your gods in vain!\n\nLear Oh, you ruffian! Infidel! [ He puts his hand to his sword ]\n\nAlb., Corn. Good sir, be patient!\n\nKent Kill your doctor and give the fee to the foul\n\ndisease! Withdraw your gift, or while I’ve still got breath to\n\nprotest, I’ll tell you that you’re doing wrong!\n\nLear Listen, traitor! On your oath of allegiance, hear me!\n\nSince you have tried to make us break our vow, which we\n\nhave never done before, and because, with excessive pride,\n\nyou’ve attempted to come between our sentence and our\n\nauthority – which, neither our character nor our rank can\n\ntolerate – to confirm our power, take your reward! We give\n\nyou five days to prepare yourself for the rigors of the world.\n\nOn the sixth, turn your hated back upon our kingdom. If on\n\nthe tenth day after that your banished body is to be found\n\nin our realm, that moment is your death. Away! By Jupiter,\n\nthis will not be revoked!\n\nKent Farewell, King. Since that’s how you want it, freedom\n\nlives abroad, and banishment is here. [ To  Cordelia ] The gods\n\nprotect you, maid. Your reasoning’s right and you’ve said\n\nwhat’s true. [ To  Goneril  and  Regan ] As for your grandiose\n\nspeeches, may your deeds live up to them! Then some good\n\nmight come from loving words. [ To the assembled nobles ]\n\nThus, Princes, Kent bids you all farewell. He’ll continue to\n\nbe his old self in a new country.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\n[ A flourish of trumpets heralds the entry of  Gloucester,  the\n\nKing of France,  the  Duke of Burgundy,  and their Attendants ]\n\nGloucester Here are France and Burgundy, my lord.\n\nLear My Lord of Burgundy: we address you first. You have\n\ncompeted with this king for our daughter’s hand. What is\n\nthe minimum dowry you will require with her, without which\n\nyou’d cease to be a suitor?\n\nBurgundy Most royal Majesty: I beg no more than your\n\nHighness has offered. Surely you would not suggest less?\n\nLear Right noble Burgundy, when we loved her, we valued\n\nher accordingly. Now her price has fallen. Sir, there she\n\nstands. If anything in particular about that outspoken object,\n\nor all of it – complete with our displeasure, and nothing\n\nmore – happens to suit your Grace, she’s there, and she is\n\nyours.\n\nBurgundy I don’t know what to say.\n\nLear Will you – with all her imperfections: friendless; our\n\nhatred freshly upon her; her dowry our curse; disowned by\n\nour vow – take her or leave her?\n\nBurgundy With respect, royal sir, decisions are not made on\n\nterms like those.\n\nLear Then leave her, sir, because by the gods that made me,\n\nI’m telling you that’s all she’s worth. [ To  France ] As for you,\n\ngreat King, I would not distance myself from your love by\n\nmarrying you to one I hate. Therefore I entreat you to turn\n\nyour affections in a worthier direction than on a wretch who\n\nbehaves so unnaturally.\n\nFrance It’s very strange that she – who just now was your\n\nmost precious possession, the subject of your praise, the\n\ncomfort of your old age, the best, the dearest – should\n\nsuddenly commit something so monstrous as to destroy\n\nsuch deep affection. Either her offense must be atrociously\n\nunnatural, or else your former vows of love are suspect.\n\nShort of a miraculous revelation, my reason would never\n\nallow me to believe that of her.\n\nCordelia I appeal to your Majesty – in spite of lacking the glib\n\nand oily art of making empty promises, preferring action\n\nrather than words – to state publicly that it is no vicious\n\nmisbehavior, murder or wickedness, no wantonness or\n\ndishonorable action, that has deprived me of your grace\n\nand favor. Rather it is for lacking what I’m better off\n\nwithout: an eye for seeking favors, and the kind of tongue\n\nI’m glad I haven’t got, though not having it has ruined me in\n\nyour affection.\n\nLear Better you had never been born than not to have pleased\n\nme better.\n\nFrance Is this all? A natural reticence that often\n\nunintentionally leaves inner thoughts unspoken? My Lord of\n\nBurgundy, what do you say to the lady? Love is not true love\n\nwhen it is subject to irrelevant conditions. Will you have\n\nher? She’s a dowry in herself.\n\nBurgundy [ to  Lear ] Royal King, just give the dowry which you\n\nyourself proposed, and I’ll take Cordelia by the hand –\n\nDuchess of Burgundy.\n\nLear Nothing. I have made a vow. I am resolute.\n\nBurgundy [ to  Cordelia ] Then I am sorry: losing a father has\n\nlost you a husband.\n\nCordelia [ wryly ] God bless Burgundy! Since he’s in love with\n\nrespectability and wealth, I shall not be his wife!\n\nFrance Fairest Cordelia, who is precious, being poor;\n\nmost exquisite, being forsaken; and most loved, being\n\ndespised! You and your virtues I here claim. If it is lawful, I\n\nwill take up what has been cast away. The gods, the gods!\n\nIt’s strange that their cold indifference should ignite my love!\n\nYour dowerless daughter, King, by good fortune mine, is\n\nqueen to me, of all I possess, and of fair France. Not all the\n\ndukes of wishy-washy Burgundy could buy this underrated\n\nbut priceless maid from me. Bid them farewell, Cordelia,\n\nunkind though they are. You lose here to gain more\n\nelsewhere.\n\nLear You’ve got her, France. She’s yours. We have no such\n\ndaughter, nor shall we ever see that face of hers again.\n\nTherefore be gone: without our good wishes, our love, or\n\nour blessing. Come, noble Burgundy!\n\n[ Lear  departs, followed by  Burgundy, Cornwall, Albany,\n\nGloucester  and the Attendants ]\n\nFrance [ to  Cordelia ] Say goodbye to your sisters.\n\nCordelia My father’s precious ones, Cordelia leaves in tears. I\n\nknow you for what you are, but as your sister I am reluctant\n\nto expose you. Love our father well. I entrust him to your\n\nso-called care. However, if I were still in favor, I’d find him\n\nsomewhere better to stay. So farewell to you both.\n\nRegan Don’t tell us what to do!\n\nGoneril Concentrate on pleasing your husband, who took you\n\nas a handout from fortune. You have been less than\n\nobedient, and you well deserve what’s happened to you.\n\nCordelia Time will reveal what deceit conceals.\n\nTricksters get exposed in the end. Good luck to you.\n\nFrance Come, my fair Cordelia.\n\n[ France  and  Cordelia  leave ]\n\nGoneril Sister, I have a lot to say of mutual interest. I think\n\nour father will leave tonight.\n\nRegan That’s for certain – and with you. Next month he’ll\n\nstay with us.\n\nGoneril You see how fickle he can be in his old age. We’ve\n\nseen plenty of examples. He always loved our sister most.\n\nHis poor judgment is very obvious from the way he now\n\ncasts her off.\n\nRegan His age is the trouble. But then he has always lacked\n\nself-control.\n\nGoneril Even in his prime he was hot-headed. So now we\n\nmust expect not only his deep-rooted faults, but also the\n\nwillfulness that comes with feeble and crochety old age.\n\nRegan We’re likely to get more sudden whims like Kent’s\n\nbanishment.\n\nGoneril And there’s the way he rudely took leave of France.\n\nWell then, let’s work together. If our father continues to\n\nexercise power in his condition, his abdication will be a\n\nproblem to us.\n\nRegan We’ll give it some more thought.\n\nGoneril We must strike while the iron is hot.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 2\n\nThe Earl of Gloucester’s castle.  Edmund  enters, carrying a letter.\n\nEdmund Nature, you are my goddess! I obey your laws. Why\n\nshould I be plagued by convention and let the narrow-\n\nmindedness of society keep me from my rights, just because\n\nI’m some twelve or fourteen months younger than my\n\nbrother? Why am I “bastard”? Why inferior? I’m as\n\nwell-proportioned, my mind is as vigorous, my build as\n\nsimilar, as the married lady’s offspring. Why do they brand\n\nus as inferior? With inferiority? Illegitimacy? Inferior,\n\ninferior? What, we – who get sounder constitutions and\n\nmore guts from hot-blooded fornication than goes into the\n\nmaking of a whole tribe of idiots conceived between\n\nbedtime and morning in a dull and tedious marriage bed?\n\nWell, then, legitimate Edgar, I must have your inheritance!\n\nOur father loves the bastard Edmund as much as the\n\nlegitimate Edgar. Fine word, “legitimate”! Well, my\n\nlegitimate, if this letter [ he flourishes it ] works properly, and\n\nmy plan prospers, Edmund the bastard will beat the\n\nlegitimate. I progress; I prosper. Now, gods – stand up for\n\nbastards!\n\n[ His father, the  Earl of Gloucester,  enters, thinking aloud ]\n\nGloucester Kent banished like that! And France has left in\n\nanger! And the King departed tonight, his power limited,\n\nrestricted to a token force! All this done on the spur of the\n\nmoment! [ He notices his son ] Greetings, Edmund. What\n\nnews?\n\nEdmund [ hiding his letter very obviously ] May it please your\n\nlordship, none.\n\nGloucester Why are you trying so hard to hide that letter?\n\nEdmund I’ve no news, my lord.\n\nGloucester What was the document you were reading?\n\nEdmund Nothing, my lord.\n\nGloucester No? Then why the indecent haste to put it into\n\nyour pocket? What’s “nothing” has no such need to hide\n\nitself. Let’s see; come on; if it’s nothing, I won’t need\n\nspectacles.\n\nEdmund I beg you, sir, excuse me: it’s a letter from my\n\nbrother that I haven’t finished reading, and from what I’ve\n\nscanned, I believe it’s not for your eyes.\n\nGloucester Give me the letter, sir!\n\nEdmund I’ll give offense whether I keep it or give it. The\n\ncontents, as far as I can follow them, are objectionable.\n\nGloucester Let’s see, let’s see!\n\nEdmund I hope – to make excuses for my brother – that he\n\nwrote this as a test or trial of my honesty.\n\nGloucester [ reading aloud ] This practice of revering old\n\npeople makes the best years of our lives a misery. It keeps\n\nour legacies from us till we’re too old to enjoy them. I’m\n\nbeginning to feel that oppression by an aged tyrant is stupid\n\nand foolish slavery. It operates not through strength, but\n\nthrough the victim’s willingness to suffer. Come and see\n\nme, so I can explain further. If our father would only sleep\n\ntill I awakened him, you’d enjoy half his income\n\nforever – and be beloved of your brother, Edgar.\n\nHmm! Conspiracy! “Sleep till I awakened him, you’d enjoy\n\nhalf his income …” My son Edgar! Could he have written\n\nthis? Had he a heart and a brain to think it up? When did this\n\ncome to you? Who brought it?\n\nEdmund It wasn’t brought to me, my lord. There’s the\n\ncunning of it. I found it thrown through the window of my\n\nbedroom.\n\nGloucester You recognize the handwriting as your brother’s?\n\nEdmund If the contents were acceptable, my lord, I’d swear it\n\nwas his. But in connection with that [ he indicates the letter ]\n\nI’d prefer to think it wasn’t.\n\nGloucester It is his!\n\nEdmund It’s his writing, my lord, but I hope his heart isn’t in\n\nthe contents.\n\nGloucester Has he ever sounded you out on this business\n\nbefore?\n\nEdmund Never, my lord. But I’ve often heard him maintain it\n\nto be only right that, once sons reach maturity and fathers\n\nare past their prime, the father should be in the custody of\n\nthe son, and the son should manage his affairs.\n\nGloucester Oh, the villain, the villain! That’s exactly what he\n\nsays in the letter! The hated villain! The unnatural,\n\ndetestable, brutish villain! Worse than brutish! Go, sir, find\n\nhim. I’ll arrest him. The detestable villain! Where is he?\n\nEdmund I don’t really know, my lord. If you could contain\n\nyour anger against my brother till you can extract from him a\n\nclearer indication of his intentions, you’d be better advised.\n\nOn the other hand, if you react violently against him,\n\nmistaking his purpose, your own honor will be greatly\n\ndamaged, and his loyalty shaken to the core. I’d stake my\n\nlife on him: he’s written this to test my love for your honor,\n\nand not with dangerous intent.\n\nGloucester Do you think so?\n\nEdmund If your honor thinks it’s a good idea, I’ll place you\n\nwhere you can hear us discuss this, and by hearing for\n\nyourself you can settle your doubts this very evening at the\n\nlatest.\n\nGloucester He can’t be such a monster –\n\nEdmund Nor is he, surely.\n\nGloucester – to his own father, who loves him so tenderly\n\nand entirely! Heaven and earth! Edmund, find him. Get his\n\nconfidence, do. Use your discretion. I’d give my all to be\n\nassured of his innocence.\n\nEdmund I’ll look for him, sir, immediately: work things as best\n\nI can, and report back.\n\nGloucester These recent eclipses of the sun and moon are\n\nbad omens for us. Though human reason can explain such\n\nthings away, nonetheless mankind has to suffer the natural\n\nconsequences. Love cools off. Friendship declines. Brothers\n\nare divided. In cities there are riots; in countries, civil war; in\n\npalaces, treason; and the bond between son and father is\n\nbroken. This villain of mine fits the pattern: there’s son\n\nagainst father. The King goes against his natural instincts:\n\nthere’s father against child. We’ve had the best years:\n\nintrigue, insincerity, treachery and chaos follow us\n\ndistressingly to our graves. Sound out this villain, Edmund;\n\nyou’ll lose nothing by it. Do it discreetly. And the noble and\n\nloyal Kent is banished: his offense, honesty! It’s strange.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nEdmund How typically stupid: when things go wrong, often\n\nthrough our own fault, we blame our troubles on the sun,\n\nmoon and stars! As though we are villains through no choice\n\nof our own; fools by order of heaven; knaves, thieves and\n\ntraitors through the dominance of a planet at our births;\n\ndrunkards, liars and adulterers by compulsion from the stars;\n\nand that all our evil acts come from divine provocation! An\n\nadmirable alibi for lecherous man, to blame his lustful\n\ndisposition on a star! My father tumbled my mother under a\n\nwaning moon and I was born under the Great Bear: so it\n\nfollows that I’m rough and lecherous? Pah! I’d be what I am\n\nhad the most chaste star in the firmament twinkled over my\n\nillegitimacy! Edgar –\n\n[ Edgar  enters ]\n\n– and here he comes, as predictably as the ending of an\n\nold-fashioned play. My role requires deep melancholy – with\n\na sigh like that of a lunatic beggar. [ He assumes a suitably\n\nsolemn face and manner of speech ] Oh, these eclipses are\n\npremonitions of disorder … [ He hums to himself as if deep\n\nin philosophic thought ]\n\nEdgar Greetings, brother Edmund! What’s the big problem on\n\nyour mind?\n\nEdmund I’m thinking, brother, of a prediction I read the other\n\nday about what will follow from these eclipses.\n\nEdgar Do you worry about things like that?\n\nEdmund I assure you that the consequences written about\n\nturn out to be disagreeable: such as unnaturalness between\n\nchild and parent; death, famine and the ending of\n\nlongstanding friendships; disunity in countries; threats and\n\ncurses against King and nobles; unfounded suspicions; the\n\nbanishment of friends; desertion of troops; matrimonial\n\nstrife; and I don’t know what.\n\nEdgar How long have you been a student of astrology?\n\nEdmund When did you last see my father?\n\nEdgar Last night.\n\nEdmund Did you speak to him?\n\nEdgar Yes. Fully two hours.\n\nEdmund Did you part on friendly terms? Did he seem\n\ndispleased by the way he spoke or looked?\n\nEdgar Not at all.\n\nEdmund Try to think how you may have offended him. Do me\n\nthe favor of avoiding him till his temper has cooled. At the\n\nmoment he’s so furious that injury to your person would\n\nhardly cool his anger.\n\nEdgar Some villain has wronged me!\n\nEdmund That’s what I fear. I advise you to keep at a discreet\n\ndistance till he calms down: and as I say, come back with\n\nme to my place, where at an opportune time I’ll let you\n\noverhear what my lord says. Please – go! There’s my key. If\n\nyou do go out, go armed.\n\nEdgar Armed, brother?\n\nEdmund Brother, I advise you for the best. I’d be a liar if I said\n\nthere’s any good will toward you. I’ve told you what I’ve\n\nseen and heard, but toned it down – nothing like the\n\nhorrible reality. Please, go!\n\nEdgar Shall I hear from you soon?\n\nEdmund Leave everything to me. [ Edgar  goes.  Edmund  laughs\n\nout loud ] A credulous father and a noble brother! He’s so\n\nincapable of mischief himself that he suspects none. His\n\nfoolish honesty is no match for my wiles. It’s very simple: if I\n\ncan’t get property through inheritance, I’ll get it by using my\n\nwits. Anything goes that suits my purposes.\n\nScene 3\n\nThe Duke of Albany’s palace. Enter  Goneril  and her steward  Oswald.\n\nGoneril Did my father strike my officer for rebuking his Fool?\n\nOswald Yes, madam.\n\nGoneril He does me wrong by day and night. Not an hour\n\npasses but he commits one flagrant offense or another\n\nthat has us all at loggerheads. I won’t put up with it. His\n\nknights are getting riotous, and he himself scolds us about\n\nevery little thing. When he returns from hunting, I won’t\n\nspeak to him. Say I’m sick. If you’re less dutiful than\n\nformerly, that will be quite all right. I’ll take the\n\nresponsibility.\n\n[ Hunting horns can be heard ]\n\nOswald He’s coming, madam. I can hear him.\n\nGoneril Be as offhand as you like, you and your colleagues. I\n\nwant to make an issue of it. If he doesn’t like it, let him go\n\nto my sister. She and I are of one mind, not to give in to\n\nhim. Silly old man, who wants to be in charge of what he’s\n\ngiven away! Upon my soul, old fools are babies again, and\n\nmust be restrained when they are deluded. Remember what\n\nI’ve said.\n\nOswald I will indeed, madam.\n\nGoneril Be cooler to his knights. Ignore the consequences.\n\nSpread the word among your colleagues. I’ll make capital\n\nout of such incidents; I will, so I can speak out. I’ll write to\n\nmy sister at once to do the same. Prepare for dinner.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 4\n\nAnother room in the palace. Enter  Kent,  in disguise\n\nKent If I can also alter my voice, I may be able to carry out the\n\nworthy purpose which prompted my disguise. Well now,\n\nbanished Kent, if you can serve where you stand\n\ncondemned, it may well be that your master, whom you\n\nlove, will discover you are a dedicated servant.\n\n[ Hunting horns herald the entrance of the  King  and his\n\nKnights ]\n\nLear [ to his  Servant ] Don’t keep me waiting for dinner! Go\n\nand get it ready. [ The  Servant  goes ] Well now, who are you?\n\nKent A man, sir.\n\nLear What’s your profession? What’s your business with us?\n\nKent I profess to be no less than I appear to be; to serve any\n\nman loyally who’ll trust me; to love the man who is honest;\n\nto consort with the man who is wise but says little; to fear\n\nbeing judged; to fight when I have no alternative; and to eat\n\nno fish.\n\nLear What are you?\n\nKent A very genuine fellow, and as poor as the King.\n\nLear If you are as poor a subject as he is a King, that’s pretty\n\npoor! What are you seeking?\n\nKent Employment.\n\nLear With whom?\n\nKent You.\n\nLear Do you know me, man?\n\nKent No, sir, but there’s something in your bearing that I\n\nrespect.\n\nLear What’s that?\n\nKent Authority.\n\nLear What services can you perform?\n\nKent I can keep a secret; ride; run; spoil a good story in the\n\ntelling of it; and deliver a simple message bluntly. What\n\nordinary men are fit for, I’m good at. My best quality is\n\ndetermination.\n\nLear How old are you?\n\nKent Not so young, sir, that I’d love a woman for singing, nor\n\nso old as to dote on her for anything. I’m forty-eight.\n\nLear Follow me. You can be my servant. If I like you no less\n\nafter dinner, I’ll take you on permanently. Dinner! hey there!\n\nDinner! Where’s my knave? My Fool? [ To an Attendant ] Go\n\nand fetch my Fool.\n\n[ The Attendant leaves.  Oswald  enters ]\n\nYou. You, fellow. Where’s my daughter?\n\nOswald [ brushing past him ] Excuse me – [ he goes ]\n\nLear What did the fellow say? Call the blockhead back! [ A\n\nKnight  goes in pursuit ] Where’s my Fool, eh? I think the\n\nworld’s asleep. [ The  Knight  returns alone ] Well, where’s\n\nthat mongrel?\n\nKnight He says, my lord, that your daughter isn’t well.\n\nLear Why didn’t the slave come back to me when I called\n\nhim?\n\nKnight Sir, he answered in the rudest manner that he would\n\nnot.\n\nLear He would not?\n\nKnight My lord, I don’t know why, but in my opinion your\n\nHighness is not being treated with the same respectful\n\nceremony as you are used to. There’s a distinct unfriend-\n\nliness among the staff, as well as in the Duke himself and\n\nyour daughter.\n\nLear Hm? Do you think so?\n\nKnight Please forgive me, my lord, if I’m mistaken. My\n\nduty won’t allow me to be silent when I think your Highness\n\nis being wronged.\n\nLear You are only reminding me of what I’ve noticed myself. I\n\nhave observed a hint of neglect lately. I’d put it down to my\n\nown jealous sensitivity rather than a deliberate intention to\n\nbe uncivil. I’ll look further into it. But where’s my Fool? I\n\nhaven’t seen him these last two days.\n\nKnight Since my young lady went to France, sir, the Fool has\n\npined away considerably.\n\nLear Enough of that. I’ve taken good note of it. [ To an\n\nAttendant ] Go and tell my daughter I want to speak to her.\n\n[ The Attendant leaves ] You [ to another ], go and bring my\n\nFool here. [ The Attendant goes ]\n\n[ Oswald  enters ]\n\nOh, you, sir. You. Come here, sir. Who am I, sir?\n\nOswald My lady’s father.\n\nLear “My lady’s father”! My lord’s lackey, you lousy dog!\n\nYou wretch! You cur!\n\nOswald I am none of these, my lord; I beg your pardon.\n\nLear Do you exchange looks with me, you rascal? [ He strikes\n\nOswald  angrily ]\n\nOswald I won’t be struck, my lord.\n\nKent Or tripped, either, you contemptible lout? [ Oswald  falls\n\nto the ground ]\n\nLear Thank you, fellow. You’re my servant, and I’ll take care\n\nof you.\n\nKent [ to  Oswald ] Come on, sir, get up and go! I’ll teach you\n\nyour place! Be off with you: go! If you want to be stretched\n\nout full length again, stay. But away with you! Use your\n\ncommon sense. [ Oswald  runs off ] That’s right.\n\nLear Now, my friendly fellow, thank you: there’s something\n\non account. [ He gives  Kent  some money ]\n\n[ The  Fool  enters ]\n\nFool Let me hire him too: here’s my coxcomb. [ He offers  Kent\n\nhis jester’s cap, which resembles a cock’s comb in shape\n\nand color ]\n\nLear Hello, there, my pretty fellow! How have you been?\n\nFool Sir, you had better have my coxcomb.\n\nKent Why, Fool?\n\nFool Why? For siding with someone who’s out of favor. No,\n\nif you can’t side with the winners, you’ll be in trouble\n\nshortly. So there: take my coxcomb. Why, this fellow\n\n[ indicating  Lear ] has alienated two of his daughters and\n\ndone the third one a blessing without intending to. If you\n\njoin his service, you’ll have to wear my coxcomb. [ To  Lear ]\n\nGreetings, uncle. I wish I had two coxcombs and two\n\ndaughters.\n\nLear Why, my boy?\n\nFool If I gave them all my possessions, I’d keep my coxcombs\n\nfor myself. [ He offers his cap to  Lear ] There’s mine. Beg the\n\nsecond off your daughters.\n\nLear Watch it, now: you’ll be whipped!\n\nFool Truth is a dog that’s sent to his kennel. He gets whipped,\n\nwhereas flattery, the hound bitch, is allowed to stand in\n\nfront of the fire, and stink.\n\nLear [ brooding ] It’s quite insufferable!\n\nFool Sir, I’ll tell you something.\n\nLear Do.\n\nFool Listen carefully, uncle:\n\nOwn more than you show,\n\nDon’t tell all you know,\n\nLend less than you’ve got,\n\nRide more than you trot,\n\nDon’t believe all you’re told,\n\nDon’t risk all your gold;\n\nGive up drink and your whores,\n\nDon’t stray out of doors,\n\nAnd you will have more\n\nThan two tens to the score.\n\nKent This is a lot of nothing, Fool.\n\nFool Then it’s like the advice of a lawyer working without\n\na fee: you get it for nothing. Can’t you make use of nothing,\n\nuncle?\n\nLear Why no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing.\n\nFool [ to  Kent ] Do me a favor. Tell him that’s what his\n\nincome amounts to. He won’t believe a Fool.\n\nLear A bitter Fool!\n\nFool [ to  Lear ] Do you know the difference, my boy, between a\n\nbitter Fool and a sweet one?\n\nLear No, lad, tell me.\n\nFool Whoever counselled you\n\nTo give away your land,\n\nCome place him here by me,\n\nWhile you for him there stand:\n\nThe sweet and bitter fool\n\nWill instantly appear;\n\nThe one in motley here –\n\nThe other standing there!\n\n[ He points to  Lear  as the bitter one ]\n\nLear Are you calling me a fool, boy?\n\nFool All your other titles you have given away. That one you\n\nwere born with.\n\nKent He’s not all fool, my lord.\n\nFool No, indeed. Lords and great men won’t let me be. If I\n\nhad the monopoly, they’d want their share of the profits.\n\nAnd ladies, too: they wouldn’t let me monopolize fooling;\n\nthey’d be snatching. Uncle, give me an egg, and I’ll give you\n\ntwo crowns.\n\nLear What two crowns would they be?\n\nFool Why, after I’d cut the egg down the middle, and eaten\n\nthe yolk, the two halves of the eggshell! When you chopped\n\nyour crown in two and gave both parts away, you were like\n\nthe man in the fable who carried his ass on his back over the\n\nmire. You had little common sense in that bald crown of\n\nyours when you gave your golden one away. If I’m speaking\n\nlike a fool, whip the man who’s responsible. [ He sings ]\n\nFools have never fared so ill\n\n’Cos wise men have turned dopey,\n\nFools don’t know how to sell their skill,\n\nWhen it’s not hard to copy.\n\nLear Since when have you been so full of songs, eh?\n\nFool I’ve been in the mood, uncle, ever since you made your\n\ndaughters your mothers. When you gave them a cane and\n\ndropped your trousers [ he sings ]\n\nThey suddenly both wept for joy,\n\nAnd I in sorrow sang,\n\nThat such a King should play the dunce,\n\nAnd join the foolish gang.\n\nPlease, uncle, employ a schoolmaster to teach your Fool\n\nhow to lie. I’d like to learn how to lie.\n\nLear If you lie, laddie, we’ll have you whipped.\n\nFool I can’t make out the relationship between you and your\n\ndaughters. They’ll have me whipped for speaking the truth;\n\nyou’ll have me whipped for lying. Sometimes I’m whipped\n\nfor saying nothing at all. I’d rather be anything at all than a\n\nFool. But I wouldn’t be you, uncle. You have sliced your\n\nbrains in two and left nothing in the middle. Here comes one\n\nof the halves.\n\n[ Goneril  enters ]\n\nLear Well, now, daughter. Why the face? You frown too\n\nmuch lately.\n\nFool You were a lucky fellow when you didn’t need to care\n\nabout her frowning. Now you are a nonentity. I’m better\n\nthan you are now. I’m a Fool. You are nothing. [ To  Goneril ]\n\nYes indeed. I’ll hold my tongue. That’s what your face is\n\nsaying, though you haven’t spoken.\n\nHush, hush:\n\nThe man who gives away his all,\n\nMay find his kindness turns to gall.\n\n[ Pointing to  Lear ] He’s an empty pea-pod.\n\nGoneril Not merely, sir, your free-speaking Fool, but others\n\namong your insolent followers are bickering and\n\nquarreling hour by hour, erupting into gross and intolerable\n\nrioting. Sir, I thought that by bringing this to your notice I’d\n\nget things put right. Now I’m beginning to fear, from what\n\nyou yourself all too recently have said and done, that you\n\nare covering up this behavior, and encouraging it by your\n\ntolerance. If this is the case, the offense would not go\n\nuncriticized. Nor would disciplinary measures for the good of\n\nsociety be slow in coming: much as they’ll offend you, and\n\nmight in other circumstances seem humiliating, if it were\n\nnot that necessity justified them.\n\nFool ‘Cos you know, uncle:\n\nThe hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo for so long\n\nThat it had its head bitten off by its young.\n\nSo out went the light and we were in darkness!\n\nLear [ to  Goneril ] Are you really our daughter?\n\nGoneril I wish you would use your common sense, which I\n\nknow you possess, and that you’d cast off these\n\ntemperamental moods which recently have changed your\n\npersonality.\n\nFool Can’t a fool tell when the cart draws the horse? Gee-up,\n\nJoan! I love you!\n\nLear Does anyone here recognize me? This can’t be Lear.\n\nDoes Lear walk like this? Speak like this? Where are his\n\neyes? Either his brain is getting weak or his senses are\n\nsluggish. What, awake? It can’t be so. Is there anyone\n\nhere who can tell me who I am?\n\nFool [ aside ] Lear’s shadow …\n\nLear [ not heeding the comment ] I’d really like to know,\n\nbecause from the evidence of sanity, knowledge and reason\n\nI’d be misled into believing I had daughters.\n\nFool Who will make you into an obedient father.\n\nLear [ to  Goneril  with heavy sarcasm ] Your name, fair lady?\n\nGoneril This play-acting, sir, is much in line with these other\n\nnew pranks of yours. I want you to understand me clearly.\n\nAs you are old and respected, you should be wise. Here you\n\nkeep a hundred knights and squires, men so disorderly, so\n\ndebauched and insolent, that our court – influenced by their\n\nconduct – resembles a rowdy inn. Luxurious living and\n\npleasure-seeking make it more like a tavern or a brothel than\n\na respectable palace. It’s so shameful as to demand instant\n\nredress. Therefore, be requested by one who’ll otherwise\n\ntake what she’s politely asking for: reduce the size of your\n\nretinue somewhat, and keep as your remaining attendants\n\nmen appropriate to your age, who can control themselves\n\nand you.\n\nLear Hell and damnation! Saddle my horses! Call my troop\n\ntogether! [ To  Goneril ] You misbegotten bastard! I won’t\n\ntrouble you. I still have one daughter left!\n\nGoneril You strike my servants, and your rowdy rabble order\n\ntheir betters around.\n\n[ Albany  enters ]\n\nLear Woe to him who repents too late! [ To  Albany ] Oh, sir, so\n\nyou’re here. Is this your doing? Answer me, sir! [ To his\n\nServants ] Get my horses ready. Oh, ingratitude! You’re a\n\nfiend with a heart of stone, more hideous than any monster\n\nof the sea when you reveal yourself in a child.\n\nAlbany Really, sir, compose yourself!\n\nLear [ to  Goneril ] Vulture! You tell lies. My troops are men of\n\nrare distinction, who know their duties, and are meticulous\n\nin living up to their honorable reputations. Oh, how a\n\nrelatively small defect seemed repugnant in Cordelia! It\n\nwrenched me apart as if I were on the rack, drew all my love\n\nfrom my heart, and generated bitterness. Oh, Lear, Lear,\n\nLear! [ He slaps his forehead in despair ] Knock at this door\n\nthat let your folly in, and your discretion out! [ Gesturing to\n\nhis followers ] Go, go, my people. [ Kent  and the Knights\n\nleave ]\n\nAlbany My lord, I am as guiltless as I am ignorant of what has\n\nupset you.\n\nLear Possibly so, my lord. [ He turns again to  Goneril ] Hear,\n\nNature, hear! Dear goddess, hear! If you intended her to be\n\nfertile, change your mind! Make her sterile! Dry up her\n\nwomb, and may her despicable body never honor her with\n\na baby! If she must breed, make her child all malice, so it will\n\nlive to be a peevish, cold-hearted torment to her! May it put\n\nwrinkles in her young brow; may tears cut channels in her\n\ncheeks; all her maternal care turn into mockery and\n\ncontempt, so that she realizes how sharper than a serpent’s\n\ntooth it is to have a thankless child! Let’s away, away …\n\n[ He rushes off, overcome with emotion ]\n\nAlbany Now by all the gods, what started that?\n\nGoneril Don’t bother yourself to find out. Let his old age have\n\nits fling.\n\n[ Lear  returns ]\n\nLear What, fifty of my followers at a stroke? Within a\n\nfortnight?\n\nAlbany What do you mean, sir?\n\nLear I’ll tell you. [ To  Goneril ] Life and death! I am ashamed\n\nthat you can shake my manly dignity like this, as though you\n\nare worthy of these hot tears that burst from me. Storms\n\nand fogs upon you! May the deep wounds of a father’s\n\ncurse pierce all your senses! Foolish old eyes, if you persist\n\nin weeping, I’ll pluck you out, and trample you and your\n\ntears into the ground. Has it really come to this? Right. So\n\nbe it. I have another daughter who I’m sure is kind and\n\ncomforting. When she hears about you, she’ll scratch your\n\nwolvish face with her nails. You’ll discover that I’ll resume\n\nthe role that you think I’ve cast off forever.\n\n[ He staggers off, overwhelmed ]\n\nGoneril Did you note that?\n\nAlbany For all the great love I have for you, Goneril, I can’t be\n\nso biased as –\n\nGoneril [ stopping him ] That’s enough. [ Calling ] Oswald there!\n\n[ To the  Fool ] You, sir – more rascal than fool – be off after\n\nyour master.\n\nFool Uncle Lear, Uncle Lear! Hold on, take the Fool with you!\n\nA fox, when one has caught her,\n\nAnd such a daughter,\n\nShould surely go for slaughter,\n\nIf my cap would buy a halter.\n\nSo the Fool chases after …\n\n[ He runs off in pursuit of  Lear ]\n\nGoneril This man [ she means her father ] has been well\n\nadvised. A hundred knights! [ Sarcastically ] It’s sensible and\n\nsafe to let him keep a hundred fully armed knights! Yes – so\n\nthat after every wild dream, each rumor, each fantasy,\n\neach complaint or dislike, he can back up his senile ways\n\nwith their power, and put our lives in jeopardy. Oswald,\n\nI say!\n\nAlbany Well, you may be worrying too much.\n\nGoneril That’s safer than trusting too much. I’d rather\n\neliminate the dangers that worry me than live continually in\n\nfear. I know his character. I’ve written to my sister reporting\n\nwhat he has said. If she accommodates him and his hundred\n\nknights after I’ve explained the undesirability –\n\n[ Oswald  returns ]\n\nWell, Oswald: have you written that letter to my sister?\n\nOswald Yes, madam.\n\nGoneril Take some companions with you and ride off. Inform\n\nher fully of my personal fear. Add such reasons of your own\n\nas may make it more convincing. Be off with you and return\n\nquickly.\n\n[ Oswald  goes ]\n\nThis very tolerant attitude of yours, my lord, though I don’t\n\ncondemn it, yet – if I may say so – you are much more\n\ncriticized for your naivety than praised for your dangerous\n\nleniency.\n\nAlbany How far you are right I don’t know. Sometimes things\n\nare best left alone.\n\nGoneril So –\n\nAlbany Well, well. Let’s see how things develop.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 5\n\nA room in the Duke of Albany’s palace. Enter  Lear, Kent,  and the  Fool.\n\nLear [ to  Kent ] Go ahead to Gloucester with this letter. Tell my\n\ndaughter only what’s needed to answer questions arising\n\nfrom the letter. If you’re not quick, I’ll be there before you.\n\nKent I will not sleep, my lord, till I’ve delivered your letter.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nFool If a man’s brains were in his heels, wouldn’t they be in\n\ndanger of chilblains?\n\nLear Yes, boy.\n\nFool Then cheer up. You’ll never need to wear soft slippers\n\nwith your intelligence.\n\nLear Ha, ha, ha!\n\nFool You’ll see your other daughter will treat you just as\n\nkindly. Because though she’s as like this one [ jerking his\n\nthumb in the direction of  Goneril ] as a crab-apple is to an\n\napple, yet I can tell what I can tell.\n\nLear What can you tell, boy?\n\nFool The taste will be the same. You know why one’s nose is\n\nin the middle of one’s face?\n\nLear No.\n\nFool Why, to keep one’s eyes on either side of one’s nose.\n\nThen what a man can’t smell out, he can look into.\n\nLear I wronged her … [ thinking of  Cordelia ]\n\nFool Do you know how an oyster makes its shell?\n\nLear No.\n\nFool I don’t either. But I can say why a snail has a house.\n\nLear Why?\n\nFool To put his head in, of course, not to give it away to his\n\ndaughters, and leave himself exposed.\n\nLear I’ll forget what’s in my nature. Me, so kind a father! Are\n\nmy horses ready?\n\nFool Your asses are preparing them. The reason why the\n\nPleiades are only seven stars is a good one …\n\nLear Because they aren’t eight?\n\nFool Yes, indeed. You’d make a good Fool!\n\nLear To take it all back again! [ He’s thinking of regaining the\n\nthrone ] Monstrous ingratitude!\n\nFool If you were my Fool, uncle, I’d have you beaten for being\n\nold too soon.\n\nLear How do you mean?\n\nFool You shouldn’t have got old till you’d acquired some\n\nsense.\n\nLear Oh, don’t let me go mad; not mad, sweet heaven! Keep\n\nme sane. I don’t want to be mad!\n\n[ A  Gentleman  enters ]\n\nWell, are the horses ready?\n\nGentleman Ready, my lord.\n\nLear [ to the  Fool ] Come on, boy …\n\nFool [ to the audience ]\n\nThe virgin of today, who laughs at my departure,\n\nWon’t be one much longer, unless something’s cut\n\nshorter.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nAct two\n\nScene 1\n\nInside the castle of the  Earl of Gloucester. Edmund  enters and meets  Curan,  a courtier.\n\nEdmund God be with you, Curan.\n\nCuran And you, sir. I’ve been with your father, and informed\n\nhim that the Duke of Cornwall, and his Duchess Regan, will\n\nbe here with him tonight.\n\nEdmund How has that come about?\n\nCuran I don’t know. You’ve heard the latest? I mean the\n\nrumors, since at the moment they’re only idle gossip.\n\nEdmund No, I haven’t. What are they?\n\nCuran Haven’t you heard of the impending wars between the\n\nDukes of Cornwall and Albany?\n\nEdmund Not a word.\n\nCuran You probably will soon. Fare you well, sir.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nEdmund The Duke coming here tonight! So much the better!\n\nMarvelous! This fits in with my scheme. My father has\n\nhidden himself to overhear my brother and I’ve got some\n\ndelicate business to do. Speed and good fortune, come\n\nto my aid! [ He calls up the adjacent stairs ] Brother, a word\n\nwith you! Come down! Brother, I say!\n\n[ Edgar  descends ]\n\n[ To the audience ] My father is watching. [ Whispering to\n\nEdgar,  and assuming an agitated manner ] Sir, run away!\n\nYour hiding place has been discovered. You have the\n\nadvantage of night cover. Have you not been speaking out\n\nagainst the Duke of Cornwall? He’s coming here now,\n\novernight, in great haste, and Regan is with him. Have you\n\nsaid anything supportive of his case against the Duke of\n\nAlbany? Think hard.\n\nEdgar I’m sure of it. Not a word.\n\nEdmund I can hear my father coming. Excuse me: I must\n\npretend to draw my sword upon you. [ He does so ] Draw\n\nyours. Make as if to defend yourself. [ Edgar,  bewildered,\n\ndoes as he is told ] Do your best. [ Speaking out loud for\n\nGloucester  to hear ] Surrender! Come to my father! Light\n\nthere! [ Whispering ] Run, brother. [ Aloud ] Torches, torches!\n\n[ Pushing  Edgar  out ] So, farewell. [ Edgar  runs off ] Some\n\nblood on me would be convincing evidence of my tough\n\nstruggle. [ He cuts his arm ] I’ve seen drunkards do more than\n\nthis in fun. [ Calling pathetically ] Father, father! [ After  Edgar ]\n\nStop, stop! Will no one help?\n\n[ Gloucester  enters with Servants and torches ]\n\nGloucester Now, Edmund, where’s the villain?\n\nEdmund He was standing here in the dark, his sharp sword\n\ndrawn, mumbling wicked spells, and making incantations to\n\nthe moon to seek her favor.\n\nGloucester But where is he?\n\nEdmund [ playing for time ] Look, sir, I’m bleeding.\n\nGloucester Where is the villain, Edmund?\n\nEdmund [ pointing ] He fled this way, sir, when he was quite\n\nunable –\n\nGloucester Follow him, quick! Go after him! [ Servants rush\n\noff in pursuit ] “Quite unable” to do what?\n\nEdmund Persuade me to murder your lordship. And I told him\n\nthe vengeful gods deal ruthlessly with parricides. I spoke\n\nabout how the bond between father and son was complex\n\nand strong. Sir, in short, seeing how bitterly opposed I was\n\nto his unnatural plan, with a deadly thrust he lunged at my\n\ndefenseless body with his naked sword and wounded my\n\narm. But when he saw my energetic response to the\n\nchallenge, inspired by the justice of the cause – or perhaps\n\naghast at the noise I made – he suddenly ran off.\n\nGloucester No matter how far he goes, there’s nowhere in\n\nthis land where he can stay free. Once found, kill him. The\n\nnoble Duke, my master and chief patron, comes here\n\ntonight. With his authority I’ll announce that whoever finds\n\nhim will be rewarded for bringing the murderous coward to\n\nhis execution. For anyone who hides him, death!\n\nEdmund When I tried to dissuade him from his plan, and\n\nfound he was determined to proceed, with angry words I\n\nthreatened to expose him. He replied, “You poverty-stricken\n\nbastard! Do you think anyone would believe a word you said\n\nif I spoke to the contrary? No. I’d deny it all – indeed I\n\nwould, even if you produced my own handwriting – and say\n\nit was your scheme, plot and treacherous proposal. People\n\nwould have to be very stupid not to see that the profits from\n\nmy death give you an obvious and powerful motive for\n\nseeking it.”\n\nGloucester Oh, that unnatural and confirmed villain! He’d\n\ndeny his letter, did he say? He’s no child of mine.\n\n[ The  Duke of Cornwall’s  trumpet-call is heard ]\n\nListen! The Duke’s trumpets. I don’t know why he’s come.\n\nI’ll block all seaports. The villain won’t escape. The Duke\n\nmust grant me that. Also, I’ll send a picture of him far and\n\nwide so that all the kingdom will take note of him. And I’ll\n\ndevise a way of your inheriting my lands, you loyal and true\n\nson.\n\n[ Cornwall, Regan  and their Attendants enter ]\n\nCornwall Greetings, my noble friend! Since I arrived just\n\nnow, I’ve heard strange news.\n\nRegan If it’s true, no vengeance is adequate in pursuit of the\n\noffender. How are you, my lord?\n\nGloucester Oh, madam, my old heart is broken. It’s broken!\n\nRegan What, did my father’s godson seek your life? The one\n\nmy father named: your Edgar?\n\nGloucester Oh, lady, lady. Shame would have it hidden.\n\nRegan Wasn’t he a companion of the riotous knights who\n\nserved my father?\n\nGloucester I don’t know, madam. It’s too awful. Too awful.\n\nEdmund [ taking his cue from Regan ] Yes, madam, he was one\n\nof that lot.\n\nRegan No wonder, then, that he was so disloyal. They’ve\n\nincited him to plan the old man’s death, so that he can\n\nsquander his wealth. Just this very evening I’ve been told\n\nabout them by my sister, with such warnings that if they\n\ncome to stay at my house, I won’t be there.\n\nCornwall Nor I, Regan, that’s for sure. Edmund, I hear you\n\nhave behaved like a good son to your father.\n\nEdmund It was my duty, sir.\n\nGloucester He revealed Edgar’s plot, and received the wound\n\nyou see while trying to arrest him.\n\nCornwall Is he being pursued?\n\nGloucester Yes, my good lord.\n\nCornwall If he’s captured, never fear his doing harm again.\n\nMake your own plans, using my resources as you please. As\n\nfor you, Edmund, whose virtuous loyalty is so commendable\n\nat this present time, you shall be one of us. Trustworthy\n\nnatures such as yours we have great need of. We seize upon\n\nyour services.\n\nEdmund [ bowing ] I shall serve you truly, sir, whatever else.\n\nGloucester On his behalf I thank your Grace.\n\nCornwall You don’t know why we came to visit you –\n\nRegan – so unexpectedly, traveling through the darkness of\n\nthe night. Business of some importance, Gloucester,\n\nrequiring your advice. Our father has written to us – and so\n\nhas our sister – about certain quarrels. I thought it best to\n\nanswer him away from home. The messengers are waiting\n\nto be dispatched. Our good old friend, be of good cheer, and\n\ngive us your much-needed advice about these matters,\n\nwhich require instant action.\n\nGloucester Your servant, madam. Your Graces are most\n\nwelcome.\n\n[ Trumpets sound as they leave ]\n\nScene 2\n\nOutside Gloucester’s castle.  Kent  and  Oswald  meet. Dawn has not yet broken.\n\nOswald Good morning to you, friend. Are you a servant here?\n\nKent Yes.\n\nOswald Where may we put our horses?\n\nKent In the mud.\n\nOswald Please, if you love me, tell me.\n\nKent I don’t love you.\n\nOswald Well, then, I don’t much care for you.\n\nKent Any more of your lip, and I’ll make you care.\n\nOswald Why the abuse? I don’t know you.\n\nKent I know you, man.\n\nOswald What do you know of me?\n\nKent You’re a rogue, a rascal, a scrap-food guzzler. A low,\n\nproud, shallow, beggarly, scruffy, upstart of a dirty, shabby,\n\ncowardly, officious, mincing rogue. A down-and-out slave.\n\nA man who’d be a pimp to get a good job, and who’s\n\nnothing but a mixture of knave, beggar, coward, procurer,\n\nand the son and heir of a mongrel bitch. A fellow I’ll beat till\n\nhe shrieks if he denies one syllable of what I’ve said!\n\nOswald Why, what a terrible fellow you are, to curse\n\nsomeone who is neither known to you, nor knows you!\n\nKent What a hard-faced rascal you are, to deny you know me!\n\nIs it two days since I tripped you up in front of the King?\n\nDraw your sword, you rogue, ’cos though it may be night,\n\nthe moon’s shining. I’ll pierce you so the moonlight shines\n\nthrough you! [ He draws ] You lousy, rascally phony! Draw!\n\nOswald Go away! I’ll have nothing to do with you!\n\nKent Draw, you rascal! You’re here with letters critical of the\n\nKing, and you side with Lady Stuck-Up against her royal\n\nfather. Draw, you rogue, or I’ll give you a real roasting!\n\nDraw, you rascal! Come on!\n\nOswald Help! Murder! Help!\n\nKent Fight, you coward! Stand your ground, you rogue! You\n\nfoppish coward, fight! [ He beats  Oswald  with the flat of his\n\nsword ]\n\nOswald Help! Murder! Murder!\n\n[ Edmund  enters with his rapier drawn ]\n\nEdmund Hey, what’s all this about? Break!\n\nKent I’ll deal with you, young shaver, if you like! Come on, I’ll\n\nteach you a few things! Come on, laddie! [ He challenges\n\nEdmund  too ]\n\n[ Cornwall  enters, with  Regan, Gloucester  and Servants ]\n\nGloucester Weapons! Fighting! What’s all this?\n\nCornwall No more, upon your lives: the next to strike dies!\n\nWhat’s the matter?\n\nRegan They are the messengers from our sister and the King.\n\nCornwall What’s the quarrel? Speak.\n\nOswald I’m out of breath, my lord.\n\nKent No wonder; your courage was so aroused. You cowardly\n\nrascal, you’re not natural. Some tailor stitched you together.\n\nCornwall You’re an odd fellow. A tailor make a man?\n\nKent Yes, a tailor, sir. A stone-cutter or a painter couldn’t\n\nhave done such a botched job, even if he’d only been\n\nworking for a couple of years.\n\nCornwall So tell me, how did your quarrel start?\n\nOswald This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared on\n\naccount of his grey beard –\n\nKent You useless wretch! You good-for-nothing! My lord,\n\nwith your permission I’ll grind this coarse villain into mortar,\n\nand plaster the wall of a privy with him. Spare my grey\n\nbeard, you dodo bird?\n\nCornwall Quiet, man! You uncouth hooligan: have you no\n\nrespect?\n\nKent Yes, sir. But anger takes precedent.\n\nCornwall Why are you so angry?\n\nKent Because such a wretch as this should display a sword\n\nbut not show any honesty. Smiling rogues such as these\n\noften gnaw like rats through bonds of love that are too tight\n\nto be undone by other means. They satisfy the lusts of their\n\ndebauched masters. They add fuel to anger; they bring chill\n\nto moods of dejection; they deny, affirm, and turn with\n\nthe wind according to their masters’ moods – knowing\n\nnothing but how to follow, like dogs. Damn your twitching\n\nface! Are you laughing at me, as if I were a fool? You goose,\n\nif you were on Salisbury Plain I’d make you cackle your way\n\nback home to Winchester.\n\nCornwall What, are you mad, old fellow?\n\nGloucester How did you come to quarrel? Explain that.\n\nKent No two men hate each other more than I and that rogue.\n\nCornwall Why do you call him a rogue? What has he done\n\nwrong?\n\nKent I don’t like his face.\n\nCornwall Or mine, or his, or hers, probably.\n\nKent Sir, I’m a plain man. I have seen better faces in my time\n\nthan any I see before me now.\n\nCornwall This is a fellow who, having been praised for\n\nbluntness, has assumed a cheeky impertinence; but he\n\nmisuses it. [ Sarcastically ] Oh no, he can’t flatter. Not he!\n\nHe has a plain, honest mind. He has to speak the truth. If\n\npeople will take it, fine. If not, it’s just his way. I know\n\nthese rogues. Behind this bluntness they conceal more\n\ncraftiness, and have corrupter purposes, than twenty\n\ngroveling bootlickers who never put a foot wrong.\n\nKent [ mockingly overpolite ] Sir, in all good faith, in sincere\n\ntruthfulness, with the gracious approval of your mightiness,\n\nwhose power – like the great ball of fire round the sun –\n\nCornwall [ interrupting ] What’s your game?\n\nKent [ reverting to normality ] To change my manner of\n\nspeech, which you disapprove of so much: I know, sir, that\n\nI’m no flatterer. The man who tricked you with plain-\n\nspeaking was a plain rogue. That I’ll never be, even if you\n\nbegged me and I risked your displeasure by turning you\n\ndown.\n\nCornwall [ to  Oswald ] What offense did you give him?\n\nOswald I didn’t give him any. Recently, through a\n\nmisunderstanding, his master the King chose to strike me.\n\nThen, backing his Majesty up and pandering to his anger, he\n\ntripped me from behind. While I was down, he insulted me,\n\nabused me, and made himself out to be such a hero that he\n\ngot credit from it, and was praised by the King for tackling a\n\nman who was offering no aggression. And, inspired by this\n\namazing achievement, he drew on me here again.\n\nKent All rogues and cowards think the noble Ajax is a coward\n\ncompared with them.\n\nCornwall Bring the stocks here! You fierce old rogue, you\n\nelderly braggart! We’ll teach you!\n\nKent Sir, I’m too old to learn. Don’t call your stocks for me. I\n\nserve the King, on whose business I was sent to you. In\n\nstocking his messenger, you would be showing scant\n\nrespect, insulting the King personally, and his office.\n\nCornwall Bring the stocks! Upon my life and honor, he’ll sit\n\nthere till noon.\n\nRegan Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too.\n\nKent Why, madam, if I were your father’s dog you wouldn’t\n\ntreat me like that.\n\nRegan Sir, you being his stooge, I will.\n\nCornwall This is a fellow of the very sort our sister wrote\n\nabout. Come, bring along the stocks.\n\n[ They are carried in ]\n\nGloucester Let me plead with your Grace not to do this. He’s\n\ngreatly at fault, and the good King, his master, will rebuke\n\nhim for it. The undignified punishment you propose is the\n\nsort that the most disreputable and discredited wretches are\n\npunished with, for petty pilfering and minor misdemeanors.\n\nThe King won’t take kindly to having his messenger\n\nshackled like this.\n\nCornwall I’ll answer for that.\n\nRegan My sister might be far more offended, having her\n\nservant abused and assaulted for carrying out her business.\n\nPut his legs in.\n\n[ Kent  is put in the stocks ]\n\nCornwall Let’s go, my lord.\n\n[ All but  Gloucester  and  Kent  leave ]\n\nGloucester I’m sorry for you, friend. It’s the Duke’s whim. As\n\nall the world well knows, his temperament will brook no\n\nrestraint or obstacle. I’ll plead for you.\n\nKent Please don’t, sir. I’ve gone without sleep and traveled a\n\nrough road. I’ll sleep away some of the time; the rest I’ll\n\nwhistle. Even a good man’s fortunes can get down at the\n\nheels. Good day to you!\n\nGloucester The Duke’s at fault in this. It will be taken badly.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nKent Good King, who should have heeded the old proverb:\n\nyou’ve gone from the frying pan into the fire! Come, moon,\n\nso that I can read this letter by your comforting beams!\n\nMiracles are mostly related to misery; I know this is from\n\nCordelia, who fortunately has been informed of my disguise.\n\nShe will find an opportune time to put things right in this\n\nmonstrous state. Take this opportunity, heavy eyes – all\n\nweary and fatigued – not to look upon these shameful\n\nstocks. Good night, Fortune! Smile once more: then turn\n\nyour wheel!\n\n[ He sleeps ]\n\nScene 3\n\nA wood.  Edgar  enters.\n\nEdgar I heard myself proclaimed an outlaw. By hiding in the\n\nconvenient hollow of a tree, I escaped the hunt. No seaport\n\nis free. There’s nowhere that isn’t tightly guarded in order to\n\ncapture me. While I can still escape, I’ll protect myself. I\n\nintend to assume the role of the lowest and poorest man\n\nthat poverty at its most degrading ever dragged down to the\n\nlevel of a beast. I’ll begrime my face with filth, wear a\n\nloin-cloth, matt all my hair in knots, and brave the winds and\n\nsufferings of the elements in the full exposure of my\n\nnakedness. There are many examples around the\n\ncountryside of lunatic beggars who, with roaring voices,\n\nstick pins, wooden skewers, nails and sprigs of rosemary in\n\ntheir cold and numbed bare arms. Using this horrible\n\nspectacle, they extort charity from humble farms, poor\n\npoverty-stricken villages, sheepfarms and mills, sometimes\n\nwith lunatic curses, sometimes with prayers. [ He speaks like\n\na Bedlam beggar ] Poor Turlygod! Poor Tom! [ In his normal\n\nvoice ] There’s that much left for me; as Edgar I’m nothing.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nScene 4\n\nOutside  Gloucester’s  castle.  Kent  is in the stocks.  Lear,  the  Fool  and a  Gentleman  enter.\n\nLear It’s strange that they should leave home like that, and\n\nnot send back my messenger.\n\nGentleman I heard that the night before they had no intention\n\nof going.\n\nKent Greetings, noble master!\n\nLear What, is this sort of disgrace a hobby with you?\n\nKent No, my lord.\n\nFool Ha, ha, he’s wearing cruel [ a pun on “crewel,” that is,\n\n“worsted” ] garters! Horses are tied by the heads, dogs and\n\nbears by the neck, monkeys by the waist, and men by the\n\nlegs. When a man gets too frisky, then he has to wear\n\nwooden stockings.\n\nLear Who has so mistaken your status that he has placed you\n\nhere?\n\nKent lt’s both “he” and “she”: your son-in-law and daughter.\n\nLear No.\n\nKent Yes.\n\nLear No, I say!\n\nKent I say yes.\n\nLear No, no. They would not!\n\nKent Yes, yes. They have.\n\nLear By Jupiter, I swear no!\n\nKent By Juno, I swear yes.\n\nLear They wouldn’t dare do it. They could not – would\n\nnot – do it! It’s worse than murder to do such a violent\n\noutrage against the King’s officer. Tell me, with reasonable\n\nhaste, how you could have deserved – or they imposed –\n\nthis treatment, coming as you did from me.\n\nKent My lord, when I delivered your Highness’s letters to\n\nthem at their home, I’d no sooner risen from my bow than a\n\nsweating courier, anxious in his haste, half breathless, came\n\npanting greetings from his mistress Goneril. He delivered\n\nletters, ignoring the fact that he was interrupting me, which\n\nthey read at once. On noting the contents, they summoned\n\ntheir servants and immediately took to their horses. They\n\nordered me to follow and await an answer at their leisure.\n\nThey gave me cold looks. So when I met the other\n\nmessenger here – whose welcome, I realized, had poisoned\n\nmine – and observed that he was the very same fellow who\n\nhad recently behaved so insolently before your Highness,\n\nhaving more courage than sense, I drew my sword. He\n\nawakened the servants with his loud and cowardly cries.\n\nYour son-in-law and daughter found this offense worthy of\n\nthe shame I’m now suffering.\n\nFool Winter isn’t over while there are wild geese about like\n\nthat!\n\nFathers who’ve no money\n\nHave children who ignore ‘em.\n\nBut fathers who are rich\n\nHave children who adore ‘em.\n\nLuck, that shameless whore,\n\nNever helps the poor.\n\nSo, you’ll have more income [ a pun : dolours ( sorrows )\n\nversus dollars ( money )] from your daughters than you can\n\ncope with in one year.\n\nLear Oh, how this smothering feeling spreads up towards my\n\nheart! [ He opens his collar ] The choking disease! Stay down,\n\nyou spreading sorrow, keep your lowly place! Where is this\n\ndaughter?\n\nKent With the Earl, sir, indoors.\n\nLear Don’t follow me. Stay here.\n\n[ He rushes off ]\n\nGentleman Did you really give no more offense than that?\n\nKent None. How come the King has so few with him?\n\nFool If you’d been put in the stocks for that question, you\n\nwould have well deserved it.\n\nKent Why, Fool?\n\nFool You must learn from the ant: there’s nothing to be\n\ngained from toiling on behalf of a lost cause. All who follow\n\ntheir noses are guided by their eyes, except blind men, and\n\nmost of them can smell a man who stinks. When a huge\n\nwheel runs down a hill, don’t hold onto it lest you break your\n\nneck trying to keep up with it. When it’s going upwards,\n\nthough, let it pull you with it. When a wise man gives you\n\nbetter advice, return mine. It’s really only for knaves, since\n\nit’s given by a Fool.\n\nThe man who works in hope of gain,\n\nAnd has no sense of loyalty,\n\nWill quit when fortune’s on the wane,\n\nAnd leave you in calamity.\n\nBut I won’t leave. The Fool will stay,\n\nAnd let the wise man go;\n\nThe knave turns Fool who runs away;\n\nThis Fool’s no knave, you know.\n\nKent Where did you learn this, Fool?\n\nFool Not in the stocks, fool.\n\n[ Lear  returns with  Gloucester ]\n\nLear Refused to speak to me! They are sick? They are tired?\n\nThey’ve traveled all night? Mere excuses: yes, the\n\nsymbols of revolt and desertion. Bring me a better answer.\n\nGloucester My dear lord, you know the fiery temperament of\n\nthe Duke; how obstinate and determined he is in having his\n\nown way.\n\nLear Vengeance! Plague! Death! Confusion! “Fiery”! What\n\n“temperament”? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester, I want to\n\nspeak to the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.\n\nGloucester Well, my good lord, I have informed them so.\n\nLear “Informed” them! Do you understand me, man?\n\nGloucester Yes, my good lord.\n\nLear The King wishes to speak to Cornwall. … The dear\n\nfather wants to speak to his daughter, commands her\n\nobedience! Are they informed of this? My breath and blood!\n\n“Fiery”? The “fiery Duke”? Tell the hot-tempered Duke\n\nthat – [ he stops short ] No, but not yet. Perhaps he isn’t\n\nwell. Illness does cause neglect of the duties we perform\n\nwhen we are fit. We are not ourselves when illness causes\n\nthe mind to suffer as well as the body. I’ll restrain myself\n\nand check my impetuous inclination to think what’s done in\n\nsickness represents the healthy man. [ He looks at  Kent  in\n\nthe stocks and flares up again ] Death to my royal power!\n\nWhy should he be sitting here? This deed convinces me that\n\nthis aloofness of the Duke and her is pure deceit. I want my\n\nservant out of the stocks! Go and tell the Duke and his wife\n\nthat I want to speak to them. Now. At once! Tell them to\n\ncome out and hear me, or I’ll beat a drum at their bedroom\n\ndoor till they think they’ll never sleep again!\n\nGloucester I’d like all to be well between you.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nLear [ holding his chest ] Oh, me! My heart is rising. But, down!\n\nFool Give it its orders, uncle, as the cockney woman did the\n\neels, when she put them in the fish paste alive! She rapped\n\nthem over the head with a stick, and cried, “Down, you\n\nplayful creatures, down!” It was her brother who, out of\n\npure kindness to his horse, put butter on his hay.\n\n[ Gloucester  returns, with  Cornwall, Regan  and Servants ]\n\nLear Good morning to you both.\n\nCornwall Hail to your Grace!\n\n[ Kent  is set free ]\n\nRegan I am glad to see your Highness.\n\nLear Regan, I believe you are. I well know the reason for\n\nthinking so. If you were not glad, I would denounce the\n\ngrave of your mother, because it would be the tomb of an\n\nadulteress. [ To  Kent ] Oh, are you free? We’ll discuss that\n\nsome other time. [ Kent  leaves ] Beloved Regan, your sister is\n\nwicked. Oh, Regan, her sharp-toothed unkindness has\n\nstabbed at my heart like a vulture that’s been tied there. I\n\ncan hardly speak to you. You won’t believe the depraved\n\nmanner with which – [ he chokes ] Oh, Regan!\n\nRegan Really, sir, have patience. I hope that you are\n\nundervaluing her, not she falling short of her duty.\n\nLear What did you say? How do you mean?\n\nRegan I can’t believe my sister would fail in her obligation to\n\nyou in the least. If, sir, she has indeed checked the rioting of\n\nyour followers, it would be on such grounds, and to such a\n\ndesirable end, as to clear her from all blame.\n\nLear My curses on her!\n\nRegan Oh, sir, you are old. You are at the end of your life. You\n\nshould be governed and led by some wiser person who\n\nknows you better than you do yourself. Therefore I beg\n\nyou return to our sister. Tell her you have wronged her.\n\nLear Ask her forgiveness? How becoming this would be to\n\nroyalty! “Dear daughter, I admit that I am old. Old people are\n\na nuisance. On my knees I beg you to grant me clothes, bed\n\nand food.” [ He kneels to drive his point home ]\n\nRegan Good sir, no more of this. These are unseemly tricks.\n\nReturn to my sister.\n\nLear [ rising ] Never, Regan. She has deprived me of half my\n\nretinue, given me black looks, and lashed me with her\n\ntongue most viciously upon the heart itself. May the entire\n\nstock of heaven’s vengeances drop on her ungrateful head!\n\nStrike her unborn children with lameness, you infectious\n\nwinds!\n\nCornwall Come, sir, come!\n\nLear Swift-moving lightning, aim your blinding flames into her\n\neyes! Infect her beauty, you fogs sucked up from the fens\n\nby the heat of the powerful sun, to strike and make her ugly!\n\nRegan Oh, the blessed gods! That’s what you’ll wish on me\n\nwhen you’re in one of your rash moods!\n\nLear No, Regan, I will never curse you. Your tender-hearted\n\nnature couldn’t turn to harshness. Her eyes are fierce, but\n\nyours are comforting, and do not smolder. It’s not in your\n\nnature to begrudge me my pleasures, to reduce my retinue,\n\nto exchange hasty words, to cut down my allowances, and\n\nfinally to lock me out. You know your natural duties; the\n\nobligations of child to parent; the ways of good manners;\n\nthe responsibilities of gratitude. You haven’t forgotten the\n\nhalf of the kingdom that I gave to you.\n\nRegan Good sir, get to the point.\n\nLear Who put my man in the stocks? [ A trumpet sounds ]\n\nCornwall Whose trumpet is that?\n\nRegan I recognize it: my sister’s. This confirms her letter, that\n\nshe’d be here soon.\n\n[ Oswald  enters ]\n\nHas your lady arrived?\n\nLear [ glowering at  Oswald ] This is the wretch whose\n\nimpudence depends on the fickle patronage of his mistress.\n\nGet out of my sight, rascal!\n\nCornwall What does your Grace mean?\n\nLear Who put my servant in the stocks? Regan, I trust you\n\ndidn’t know about it. [ Goneril  approaches ] Who comes\n\nhere? Oh, gods: if you love old men; if your gracious\n\npower approves of obedience; if you yourselves are old;\n\nmake this an issue. Intercede, and take up my cause! [ To\n\nGoneril ] Are you not ashamed to look upon this beard? [ The\n\nsisters embrace ] Oh, Regan, will you hold her hand?\n\nGoneril Why not my hand, sir? What have I done wrong? All is\n\nnot “offense” simply because it’s so-called by the\n\nirresponsible and those in their dotage.\n\nLear [ holding his heart ] Is there no release? [ To  Cornwall ]\n\nHow did my man come to be in the stocks?\n\nCornwall I put him there, sir. His misconduct merited worse.\n\nLear You! Did you?\n\nRegan Really, father, being weak, act accordingly. If you will\n\nreturn with my sister and stay with her till the end of your\n\nmonth – dismissing half your retinue – you can then come\n\nto me. I am away from home now, and unable to provide\n\nproperly for your maintenance.\n\nLear Return to her? With fifty men dismissed? No! Instead, I\n\nreject all shelter, and choose to fight the elements, befriend\n\nthe wolf and owl, suffer hardship! Return with her? Why, I\n\ncould as well be made to kneel before the throne of\n\npassionate France, who took our youngest-born without a\n\ndowry, and beg a pension from him, like some petty squire,\n\nto make ends meet. Return with her? I’d rather you\n\npersuaded me to be slave and drudge to this detested\n\nservant! [ He points at  Oswald ]\n\nGoneril Please yourself, sir.\n\nLear I beg you, daughter, do not make me mad. I won’t\n\ntrouble you, my child. Farewell. We’ll meet no more. We’ll\n\nsee each other no more. [ His anger returns ] But still you are\n\nmy flesh and blood, my daughter; or rather, a disease that’s\n\nin my flesh, which is mine whether I like it or not. You’re a\n\nboil, a plague-sore, a swollen tumor in my infected blood!\n\n[ Calm again ] But I won’t curse you. Let shame choose its\n\nown time – I won’t summon it. I do not call on Jupiter for\n\nvengeance, or tell tales about you to Jove, whose\n\njudgment is supreme. Reform when you can. Be better at\n\nyour leisure. I can be patient. I can stay with Regan, I and\n\nmy hundred knights.\n\nRegan Not quite. I wasn’t expecting you yet, nor am I\n\nprepared for a fitting welcome. Listen to my sister.\n\nAnyone considering your words dispassionately would\n\nconclude you are old, and therefore – but she knows what\n\nshe is doing.\n\nLear Is this well said?\n\nRegan It certainly is, sir. What, fifty followers? Isn’t that\n\nplenty? Why should you need more? Yes, or so many, since\n\nthe expense and the danger both argue against so great a\n\nnumber? How, in one house, could so many people under\n\ntwo commands live in harmony? It’s difficult – almost\n\nimpossible.\n\nGoneril Why couldn’t you, my lord, be attended by her\n\nservants, or by mine?\n\nRegan Why not, my lord? If they happened to become\n\nneglectful, we could correct them. If you want to come to\n\nme, because now I perceive a danger, I would ask you to\n\nbring only twenty-five. I’ll accommodate and recognize no\n\nmore.\n\nLear I gave you everything …\n\nRegan And you took your time about it!\n\nLear … made you my stewardesses and trustees, but with a\n\nproviso that I should have a retinue of such a number.\n\nWhat? Must I come to you with twenty-five? Regan, is that\n\nwhat you said?\n\nRegan And say it again, my lord. No more with me.\n\nLear Some wicked creatures seem attractive when compared\n\nwith others more wicked still. Not being the worst is some\n\nmeasure of praise. [ To  Goneril ] I’ll go with you. Your fifty is\n\ntwice twenty-five, and your love is double hers.\n\nGoneril Listen to me, my lord. Why do you need twenty-\n\nfive – ten – or five – to attend you, in a house where twice\n\nas many are at your service?\n\nRegan What need have you of one?\n\nLear Oh, don’t argue about “need”! Our lowliest beggars\n\nhave something they could do without. If you argue for the\n\nbare necessities, then man’s life would be no better than a\n\nbeast’s. You are a lady: if being warm were the purpose of\n\nbeing well-dressed, well then, there’d be no physical reason\n\nfor the fashionable clothes you are wearing, which hardly\n\nkeep you warm. Whereas true need – [ he breaks off ]\n\nHeavens, give me patience, the patience I require! You see\n\nme here, you gods, a poor old man, as full of grief as I am of\n\nage; wretched in both respects! If you are responsible for\n\nturning these daughters’ hearts against their father, don’t\n\nmake me such a fool as to bear it tamely! Inspire me with\n\nnoble anger, and don’t let women’s weapons – tears –\n\nstain my man’s cheeks! No, you unnatural hags, I’ll do such\n\nthings in revenge – I can’t say what at present, but they will\n\nbe earth-shattering! You think I’ll cry? No, I won’t cry. I’ve\n\ngot every reason to cry [ thunder claps are heard in the\n\ndistance ], but this heart of mine will break into a hundred\n\nthousand pieces before I’ll cry. Oh, Fool! I shall go mad! [ He\n\nstaggers out, followed by  Gloucester,  the  Gentleman  and\n\nthe  Fool ]\n\nCornwall Let us go in. There’s going to be a storm.\n\nRegan This is a small house. The old man and his retinue\n\ncan’t be adequately lodged.\n\nGoneril It’s his own fault. He’s upset himself, and he must\n\nsuffer for his folly.\n\nRegan For himself, I’ll take him gladly. But not one follower.\n\nGoneril That’s my attitude exactly. Where is my Lord of\n\nGloucester?\n\nCornwall He followed the old man out. He’s back.\n\n[ Gloucester  enters ]\n\nGloucester The King is in a terrible rage.\n\nCornwall Where is he going?\n\nGloucester He’s summoned the horses. Where he’s going, I\n\ndon’t know.\n\nCornwall Best give him his own way. He’s his own master.\n\nGoneril My lord, by no means plead with him to stay.\n\nGloucester Alas! It’s almost night, and the bleak winds are\n\nblustering fiercely. There’s hardly a bush for miles around.\n\nRegan Oh, sir, willful men can only learn by suffering from\n\ntheir own actions. Shut your doors. His attendants are a\n\ndesperate lot, and it’s only sensible to fear what they might\n\nprovoke him into doing. He’s apt to be misled.\n\nCornwall Shut your doors, my lord. It’s a wild night. My\n\nRegan’s advice is sound. Come out of the storm.\n\n[ They leave ]\n\nAct three\n\nScene 1\n\nA heath during a violent storm.  Kent  and a  Gentleman  meet.\n\nKent Who’s there, besides foul weather?\n\nGentleman Someone as disturbed as the weather is.\n\nKent I know you. Where’s the King?\n\nGentleman He’s battling with the angry elements. He tells the\n\nwind to blow the earth into the sea, or raise the waves\n\nabove the mainland, to bring chaos or destruction. He tears\n\nhis white hair, which violent blasts, blind with rage, seize in\n\ntheir fury and treat with scant respect. He strives with his\n\npuny human frame to out-storm the wind and rain as it\n\nswirls to and fro in conflict. Tonight, when even the\n\nhungry mother-bear takes cover, and the lion and the\n\nstarving wolf keep their fur dry, he runs bareheaded, and\n\ncries out in reckless desperation.\n\nKent But who is with him?\n\nGentleman Only the Fool, who tries to joke away his master’s\n\nheartfelt injuries.\n\nKent Sir, I know you, and on that account I’ll risk entrusting\n\nsomething important to you. Although it’s concealed by\n\ntheir craftiness, there is a rift between Albany and Cornwall.\n\nThey have servants – which great ones have not? – who\n\nseem genuine, but who are spies supplying information\n\nabout our kingdom to the King of France: either concerning\n\nthe quarrels and intrigues of the Dukes; or the tough way\n\nboth have handled the kind old King; or something more\n\nprofound, of which these are perhaps the outward\n\nmanifestations. But the fact is that an army has arrived,\n\nfrom France, in this divided kingdom. Taking advantage of\n\nour negligence, they have already established a secret\n\nfoothold in some of our best ports, and are on the point of\n\nrevealing themselves. Now, as for you, if you’ll trust me to\n\nthe extent of hastening to Dover, you’ll find men there\n\nwho’ll thank you for delivering a true account of the\n\nunnatural and maddening sorrow which the King is suffering\n\nfrom. I am a gentleman of noble blood and good breeding,\n\nand I offer this commission to you on reliable information.\n\nGentleman I’d like to discuss this further.\n\nKent No, don’t. For confirmation that I am more than my\n\noutward appearance suggests, open this purse and take\n\nwhat it contains. [ The  Gentleman  finds a ring inside ] If you\n\nshould see Cordelia – and no doubt you will – show her this\n\nring, and she will tell you who the fellow is who’s now\n\nunknown to you. Damn this storm! I’ll look for the King.\n\nGentleman Give me your hand. Have you nothing to add?\n\nKent Few words, but of prime importance. When we find the\n\nKing – you go that way, and I’ll go this – whoever sees him\n\nfirst, shout to the other.\n\n[ They leave separately ]\n\nScene 2\n\nAnother part of the heath. The storm still rages.  Lear  and the  Fool  enter.\n\nLear Blow, winds, and burst your cheeks! Rage! Blow! You\n\nfloodgates and waterspouts: gush till you’ve drenched our\n\nchurch steeples and drowned the weathercocks! You\n\nsearing and mind-dazzling flashes – forerunners of\n\noak-splitting thunderbolts – singe my white head! And you,\n\nall-shaking thunder: flatten the globe! Crack the molds\n\nwhich Nature uses for replenishment! Destroy in an instant\n\nthe seeds from which ungrateful man is born!\n\nFool Oh, uncle, flattery in a house that’s dry is better than\n\na drenching out in the open. Good uncle, go in and ask a\n\nblessing from your daughters. This is a night fit for neither\n\nwise men nor fools.\n\nLear Rumble your bellyful! Spit, fire! Spout, rain! Rain, wind,\n\nthunder, fire – they’re not my daughters! I don’t accuse you,\n\nyou natural elements, of unkindness! I never gave you a\n\nkingdom, or called you children. You owe me no deference.\n\nSo enjoy yourselves: Here I stand, your victim – a poor,\n\ninfirm, weak and despised old man! You’re no better than\n\nservile lackeys if you’ll conspire with two pernicious\n\ndaughters to use your heavenly battalions against a head so\n\nold and white as mine! Oh, it’s despicable!\n\nFool The man who has a house to put his head in has got a\n\nhat with brains under it.\n\nThe horny man who fornicates\n\nBefore he saves a penny,\n\nHis life to lice he dedicates\n\nSo beggars marry many.\n\nThe foolish man who cherishes\n\nHis toe more than his heart,\n\nWill think from corns he perishes\n\nAnd wake up with a start.\n\nThere never yet was a beautiful woman who didn’t preen\n\nherself in front of a mirror.\n\n[ Kent  enters ]\n\nLear [ to himself ] No, I will be a model of patience. I’ll say\n\nnothing.\n\nKent Who’s there?\n\nFool Indeed, here’s graciousness and vulgarity – that is, a\n\nwise man and a Fool.\n\nKent Alas, sir, are you here? Even nocturnal things dislike\n\nsuch nights as these. The angry skies terrify even the wild\n\nanimals and make them keep to their caves. Since I was\n\ngrown, I don’t remember ever having seen such sheets of\n\nfire, or heard such peals of thunder, such groans of roaring\n\nwind and rain. Man is not made to endure such suffering\n\nand fear.\n\nLear Let the almighty gods, who are making this dreadful\n\nhubbub over our heads, identify their enemies now!\n\nTremble, you wretch, with your undiscovered crimes as yet\n\nunpunished! Hide yourself, you murderer; you perjurer; you\n\nincestuous humbug! Rogue, shiver yourself to pieces: under\n\ncover of convenient hypocrisy you’ve tricked your way\n\nthrough life! Well-hidden crimes, burst out from your\n\nconcealment, and plead for mercy from those dreadful\n\nministers of vengeance! [ Removing his hat to show he has\n\nnothing to fear himself ] I am a man who’s been more sinned\n\nagainst than ever he has sinned.\n\nKent Alas, bare-headed! My gracious lord, there is a shed\n\nclose by here. It will afford you some friendly protection\n\nagainst the tempest. Rest there, while I return to this cruel\n\nhouse – whose occupants, harder-hearted than the stone of\n\nwhich it is made, recently refused me admittance when I\n\ninquired after you – to wrest from them the courtesy they\n\nhave failed to show.\n\nLear My mind is going. [ To the  Fool ] Come on, my boy. [ He\n\nputs his arm around him ] How are you, my boy? Are you\n\ncold? I’m cold myself. [ To  Kent ] Where is this straw, my\n\nfellow? Need transforms things strangely. It can make what’s\n\npaltry, precious. Come then, to your shed. Poor Fool and\n\nknave, there’s one part of my heart that’s sorry still for you.\n\nFool [ he sings ] He whose brain is somewhat dim,\n\nWith hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n\nMust take what Fortune gives to him\n\nThough the rain keeps raining every day.\n\nLear True, boy. [ To  Kent ] Come, take us to this shed. [ Lear\n\nand  Kent  go ]\n\nFool This is a fine night for cooling down a lustful wench. I’ll\n\nspeak a prophecy before I go:\n\nWhen priests are theorists, not doers;\n\nWhen beer is watered by the brewers;\n\nWhen nobles teach their tailors stitches;\n\nAnd lusty lads all suffer itches;\n\nWhen every case is right in law;\n\nNo gentry-folk say they are poor;\n\nWhen tongues aren’t used for slanderous tales;\n\nAnd thieves aren’t caught and sent to jails;\n\nWhen moneylenders show their hoards;\n\nAnd churches are endowed by bawds;\n\nThen shall all the British nation\n\nCome to its humiliation.\n\nThat’s when, if you are still around,\n\nFeet will be used to walk on ground.\n\nMerlin the magician will make this prophecy one day. I was\n\nborn before his time.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nScene 3\n\nA room in Gloucester’s castle after dark.  Gloucester  and  Edmund  enter , carrying torches.\n\nGloucester Alas, alas! Edmund, I don’t like this unnatural\n\nbehavior. When I asked their permission to take pity on\n\nhim, they commandeered my house, and ordered me – on\n\npain of their permanent displeasure – neither to speak of\n\nhim, plead for him, or in any way sustain him.\n\nEdmund How savage and unnatural!\n\nGloucester Sh! Say nothing. The Dukes have quarreled, and\n\nsomething worse: I’ve had a letter about it tonight. It’s too\n\ndangerous to talk about; I’ve locked it in my bedroom. These\n\nwrongs the King is suffering will be revenged to the full.\n\nPart of an army has already landed; we must take the King’s\n\nside. I’ll look for him and aid him secretly. Go and keep the\n\nDuke talking, so that he won’t observe my charity. If he asks\n\nfor me, say I’m ill and gone to bed. Even if I die for it – as\n\nthey’ve threatened me – the King, my old master, must be\n\ngiven help. Strange things are about to happen, Edmund. Do\n\nbe careful.\n\n[ He goes in search of  Lear ]\n\nEdmund I’ll tell the Duke at once about this kindness, which\n\nyou have been forbidden to do. And the letter, too. This\n\nshould be worth something to me, and must gain me what\n\nmy father will lose: nothing less than everything! The young\n\nrise when the old fall.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nScene 4\n\nThe heath, in front of the shed.  Lear  enters, with  Kent  and the  Fool.\n\nKent Here’s the place, my lord. Good my lord, go in. The\n\nsuffering of a night out in the open is too much for flesh and\n\nblood to endure.\n\n[ The storm rages on unabated ]\n\nLear Leave me alone.\n\nKent Good my lord, go in.\n\nLear Will you break my heart?\n\nKent I’d rather break my own. Good my lord, enter.\n\nLear You think it’s remarkable that this raging storm soaks us\n\nto the skin. So it is, to you. But where there’s a greater\n\nsuffering, the lesser is hardly felt. You’d avoid a bear; but if\n\nyour escape lay toward the roaring sea, you’d tackle the\n\nbear face to face. When there’s nothing on your mind, you\n\nare conscious of your ailments; this tempest going on in my\n\nmind obliterates all feeling other than what’s tormenting\n\nme – the ingratitude of my daughters! Isn’t it equivalent to\n\nmy mouth biting my hand for lifting food to it? I’ll punish\n\nruthlessly! No, I’ll weep no more. To shut me out on a night\n\nlike this! [ To the rain ] Pour on – I can take it! [ To  Kent ] On\n\nsuch a night as this! Oh, Regan, Goneril! Your kind old father,\n\nwhose open-heartedness gave you all! Oh, that way leads to\n\nmadness! Let me avoid that! I mustn’t think of that!\n\nKent Good my lord, go in here.\n\nLear Please go in yourself: seek some comfort. This tempest\n\nprevents me from thinking about things that would hurt me\n\nmore. But I’ll go in. [ To the  Fool ] In, boy. Go first. [ He\n\nreturns to his thoughts ] You who are poor and\n\nhomeless – [ noting the  Fool  is hesitant ] No – go in. I’ll pray\n\nand then I’ll sleep. [ The  Fool  obeys ] Poor naked wretches,\n\nwherever you are, that endure the pelting of this pitiless\n\nstorm: how shall your bare heads and bony bodies, your\n\ntattered-and-torn raggedness, protect you from storms such\n\nas these? Oh, I’ve cared too little about this! Take a dose of\n\nthis medicine, great ones! Expose yourself to feel what\n\nwretches feel, so that you can share their extra wealth, and\n\nshow that the gods are just!\n\nEdgar [ from inside, as if he’s taking soundings from a sinking\n\nship ] Fathom and a half! Fathom and a half! Poor Tom!\n\n[ The  Fool  rushes out, terrified ]\n\nFool Don’t come in here, uncle. There’s a ghost. Help me,\n\nhelp me!\n\nKent Give me your hand. [ Calling inside ] Who’s there?\n\nFool A spirit, a spirit! He says his name’s Poor Tom.\n\nKent Who are you, grumbling there in the straw? Come out.\n\n[ Edgar  appears, disguised as a madman ]\n\nEdgar [ talking dementedly ] Go away! The foul fiend follows\n\nme! The cold winds blow through the prickly hawthorn\n\nbushes. Hmm. [ To  Lear ] Go to your bed and get warm.\n\nLear Did you give everything to your daughters? And have you\n\ncome down to this?\n\nEdgar Who gives anything to Poor Tom? The foul fiend has\n\nled him through fire and through flame, through ford and\n\nwhirlpool, over bog and quagmire. He’s put knives under his\n\npillow, and hung nooses from his balconies. He’s put\n\npoison by his soup; made him overproud, riding a brown\n\ntrotting-horse over narrow bridges, chasing his own shadow\n\nas if it were a traitor. Bless your five wits! Tom’s cold. [ He\n\nshivers and stamps his feet, making noises to warm himself ]\n\nOh, do-de, do-de, do-de! Bless you against whirlwinds,\n\nshooting stars and evil influences! Do Poor Tom a favor,\n\nwho’s tormented by the foul fiend. [ He swipes at an\n\nimaginary attacker ] I could catch him now – and there – and\n\nthere again – and there!\n\n[ The storm rages on ]\n\nLear What, have his daughters brought him to this? Could you\n\nsave nothing? Did you give them everything?\n\nFool No, he kept a blanket, or he would all have been shamed.\n\nLear May all the plagues that hover menacingly in the air over\n\nmen’s faults now descend upon your daughters!\n\nKent He has no daughters, sir.\n\nLear Death to you, traitor! Nothing could have brought him\n\ndown to this but his unkind daughters! Is it the fashion now\n\nfor discarded fathers to endure such sufferings of the flesh?\n\nHow just the punishment! It was this very flesh that\n\nconceived those father-killing daughters!\n\nEdgar [ reciting an old rhyme ] “Pillycock sat on Pillycock Hill.”\n\n[ The second line is “If he’s not gone, he sits there still,” but\n\nEdgar  replaces it with howling noises ] Alow, alow! Loo!\n\nLoo!\n\nFool This cold night will turn us all into fools or madmen.\n\nEdgar Beware of the foul fiend. Obey your parents. Tell no\n\nlies. Don’t swear. Commit no adultery. Do not yearn for\n\nsplendid clothes. [ He shudders ] Tom feels cold.\n\nLear What were you?\n\nEdgar A lover, proud in heart and mind. I curled my hair, wore\n\nlove-tokens in my hat, fulfilled the heart’s desire of my loved\n\none and slept with her. I made vows with every word I\n\nspoke, and broke them openly. My dreams were fantasies\n\nof lust; I awoke to practice them. Wine I loved deeply;\n\ngambling, dearly; as for women, I had more mistresses than\n\nthe Sultan of Turkey. I was deceitful; interested in scandal;\n\nquick to draw blood; as lazy as a hog, stealthy as a fox,\n\ngreedy as a wolf, mad as a dog, ruthless as a lion. Don’t be\n\nturned on by the creaking of shoes or the sound of rustling\n\nsilks. Keep your feet out of brothels, your hand away from\n\npetticoats, your signature from moneylenders’ ledgers, and\n\ndefy the foul fiend. The cold wind blows through the\n\nhawthorn bushes: it says [ imitating the sound ] “suum,\n\nmum, hey-no-nonny.” [ He seems to recognize a presence ]\n\nThe devil, my boy, boy! [ He puts his finger to his lips ] Sh!\n\nLet him pass by.\n\n[ The storm rages on ]\n\nLear You’d be better off in your grave than trying to endure\n\nthis extreme weather in your nakedness. Is man no more\n\nthan this? [ To the  Fool ] Note him well. [ To  Edgar ] You’re not\n\nindebted to the silkworm for its silk; or the ox for its hide;\n\nthe sheep for its wool; or the civet cat for its perfume.\n\n[ Pointing to himself,  Edgar  and the  Fool ] We three are\n\ntainted, but you are the genuine article! Basic man is only a\n\npoor, bare, two-legged animal such as you are. [ He begins\n\nto take off his clothes ] Off, off, you borrowings! Come,\n\nunbutton here!\n\nFool Please, uncle, don’t do that! It’s a wicked night to go\n\nswimming in. [ He sees  Gloucester  approaching carrying a\n\ntorch ] Now a little fire in a big field is like the heart of an old\n\nlecher: a small spark of life with all the rest of his body cold.\n\nLook, here comes a walking fire!\n\n[ Gloucester  enters with a torch ]\n\nEdgar This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet; he begins at\n\ncurfew-time, and walks about till midnight. He gives\n\ncataracts, squints eyes, and makes harelips. He mildews\n\nthe ripening wheat, and hurts the poor creatures of the\n\nearth.\n\nSaint Withold three times walked his land;\n\nHe met a demon and her ninefold band;\n\nHer progress he stayed,\n\nHer power he allayed,\n\nAnd “Be off with you, witch! Be off!”\n\nKent How is your Grace?\n\nLear [ peering in the dark ] Who’s he?\n\nKent [ to  Gloucester ] Who’s there? What are you looking for?\n\nGloucester Who are you, there? Your names?\n\nEdmund Poor Tom, who eats the swimming frog, the toad,\n\nthe tadpole, the wall-newt and the water-newt. When the\n\nfoul fiend rages, he eats cowdung instead of salads;\n\nswallows dead rats and dead dogs; drinks the scum from\n\nstanding ponds; is whipped from settlement to settlement,\n\nput in the stocks, imprisoned. He once had three suits and\n\nsix shirts, a horse to ride and weapons to wear,\n\nBut mice and rats and such small game\n\nHave been Tom’s food for seven long year.\n\nBeware of my devil. [ He talks to an invisible companion ] Be\n\nquiet, Smulkin! Be quiet, you fiend!\n\nGloucester What, has your Grace no better company?\n\nEdgar The King of the Devils is a gentleman. He’s called\n\n“Modo”, and “Mahu”.\n\nGloucester Humanity is so degraded, my lord, it hates its\n\nparents.\n\nEdgar Poor Tom is cold.\n\nGloucester [ to  Lear ] Come in with me. My sense of duty does\n\nnot stretch so far as to obey all your daughters’ harsh\n\ncommands. Though their orders are to bar my doors and let\n\nthis pitiless night have its way with you, I’ve nevertheless\n\nventured to find you and bring you where warmth and food\n\nare ready.\n\nLear First let me talk with this philosopher. [ To  Edgar ] What is\n\nthe cause of thunder?\n\nKent Good my lord, take his offer. Go into the house.\n\nLear I’ll have a word with this learned professor. What is your\n\nsubject?\n\nEdgar How to avoid the fiend, and to kill vermin.\n\nLear Let me ask you one word in private.\n\nKent Plead with him once more to go in, my lord. His mind is\n\nfailing.\n\nGloucester Can you blame him? [ Claps of thunder are heard\n\noverhead ] His daughters want him dead. Ah, that good\n\nKent : he said it would be like this, the poor, banished man!\n\nYou say the King is going insane. I’ll tell you this, my friend:\n\nI’m almost mad myself. I had a son, now disowned. He\n\nsought my life, only recently, recently. I loved him, friend.\n\nNo father loved his son more. To tell you the truth, the grief\n\nhas touched my mind. What a night this is! [ To  Lear ] I beg\n\nyour Grace –\n\nLear Oh, I beg your pardon, sir. [ To  Edgar ] Noble philosopher,\n\ndo join us.\n\nEdgar Tom’s cold.\n\nGloucester In, fellow, there – into the shed. Keep yourself\n\nwarm.\n\nLear Come, let’s all go in.\n\nKent This way, my lord.\n\nLear [ his arm around  Edgar ] With him: I want to be with my\n\nphilosopher.\n\nKent [ to  Gloucester ] Good my lord, humor him. Let him take\n\nthe fellow with him.\n\nGloucester You take charge of him.\n\nKent [ to  Edgar ] Come on, go with us.\n\nLear Come, good Athenian.\n\nGloucester [ to  Edgar ] Don’t say anything; don’t say anything.\n\nSh!\n\nEdgar Squire Roland to the dark tower came,\n\nHis motto was: Fie, foh, and fum:\n\nI smell the blood of an Englishman.\n\n[ They enter the shed ]\n\nScene 5\n\nA room in Gloucester’s castle.  Cornwall  and  Edmund  enter.  Cornwall  is waving a letter.\n\nCornwall I’ll have my revenge before I leave this house.\n\nEdmund What people will say about me, in putting loyalty\n\nbefore my feelings as a son, I fear to think.\n\nCornwall I see now that it wasn’t just your brother’s evil\n\ndisposition that made him seek his father’s death. He was\n\nprovoked into it, helped by his wicked nature.\n\nEdmund How wickedly unfortunate that loyalty to my country\n\nshould give me a feeling of guilt! This is the letter my father\n\nspoke of, which proves he is a spy acting on behalf of\n\nFrance. Oh, heavens! Would that this treason had never\n\nhappened, and that I wasn’t the one to discover it!\n\nCornwall Come with me to the Duchess.\n\nEdmund If the contents of this letter are true, you have\n\nimportant work to do.\n\nCornwall True or false, it has made you the Earl of\n\nGloucester. Find your father, so we can arrest him.\n\nEdmund [ aside ] If I find him giving aid and comfort to the\n\nKing, it will make the Duke even more suspicious. [ Aloud ] I\n\nshall continue in my loyal course, in spite of the painful\n\nconflict between duty and my feelings as a son.\n\nCornwall I have every confidence in you: and you’ll find I’ll\n\nmake you a more loving father.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 6\n\nA room in a farmhouse near the castle.  Gloucester  and  Kent  enter.\n\nGloucester This is better than the open air. Be thankful for it.\n\nI’ll try to make it more comfortable with what extras I can\n\nfind. I won’t be away long.\n\nKent His mind has completely gone under the stress. The\n\ngods reward your kindness!\n\n[ Gloucester  goes ]\n\n[ Lear  enters, with  Edgar  and the  Fool ]\n\nEdgar Frateretto calls me, and tells me that Nero fishes in the\n\nlake of hell. [ To the  Fool ] Pray, innocent one, and beware\n\nof the foul fiend!\n\nFool Now, uncle, can you tell me whether a madman is a\n\ngentleman, or just someone who is rich?\n\nLear A king, a king!\n\nFool No. The rich man’s son becomes a gentleman. Only a\n\nmadman would have his son a gentleman before he’s one\n\nhimself!\n\nLear [ brooding to himself about his ungrateful daughters ] To\n\nhave a thousand devils armed with red-hot pokers come\n\nchasing after them …\n\nEdgar [ jerking about ] The foul fiend is biting my back!\n\nFool Anyone’s mad who trusts in the tameness of a wolf, or\n\nthe health of a horse that’s for sale, or a boy’s love, or a\n\nwhore’s promise.\n\nLear [ still in a world of his own ] It shall be done. I’ll prosecute\n\nthem immediately. [ To  Edgar ] Come, sit you here, most\n\nlearned judge. [ To the  Fool ] You, wise sir, sit here. [ Rubbing\n\nhis hands ] Now, you she foxes!\n\nEdgar [ pointing to  Lear ] Look how he stands and glares! [ To\n\nthe imaginary plaintiff ] Are you showing off in the\n\nwitness-box, madam? [ He breaks out into a romantic\n\nlove-song ]\n\nCome over the stream, Bessy, to me –\n\nFool [ joining in, picking up his words ]\n\nHer boat’s got a leak,\n\nAnd she must not speak\n\nWhy she dares not come over to you!\n\nEdgar [ commenting on the quality of the  Fool’s  singing voice ]\n\nThe foul fiend haunts Poor Tom, disguised as a nightingale.\n\n[ He rubs his stomach ] Hoppedance is crying out in Tom’s\n\nbelly for two pickled herrings. Stop your rumbling, black\n\nangel: I’ve no food for you.\n\nKent [ to  Lear ] How are you, sir? Don’t be dismayed. Will you\n\nlie down and rest on these cushions?\n\nLear I’ll see their trial first. Bring in the witnesses. [ To  Edgar,\n\nwho is scantily attired ] Take your place, you man of justice,\n\nin your robes. [ To the  Fool ] And you, his learned colleague,\n\ntake your seat on the bench, at his side. [ To  Kent ] You are\n\none of the magistrates. You must sit too.\n\nEdgar Let us handle the case justly. [ He sings ]\n\nAre you sleeping or awake, jolly shepherd?\n\nYour sheep are in the corn.\n\nIf you’d only give one little blast on your whistle,\n\nYour sheep would come to no harm.\n\n[ He makes a noise with his mouth ] Purr! [ Explaining ] The cat\n\nis gray.\n\nLear [ pointing to an unoccupied seat ] Prosecute her first: it’s\n\nGoneril. I here take my oath before this honorable\n\nassembly, that she kicked the poor King, her father.\n\nFool Come here, mistress. Is your name Goneril?\n\nLear She can’t deny it.\n\nFool I beg your pardon. I mistook you for a stool!\n\nLear And here’s another one whose ugly looks reveal what\n\nher heart is made of. [ He jumps up excitedly ] Stop her there!\n\nArms, arms, sword, fire! There’s corruption here! [ To  Edgar ]\n\nFalse judge – why have you let her escape?\n\nEdgar Bless your five wits!\n\nKent Oh, for pity! Sir, where now is the self-control you have\n\nso often boasted of?\n\nEdgar [ aside, as himself ] My tears of sympathy for him are\n\nbeginning to ruin my disguise.\n\nLear Even the little dogs – Tray, Blanch and Sweetheart –\n\nsee, they are barking at me!\n\nEdgar Tom will throw his head at them. Get away, you curs!\n\nWhether your mouth is black or white,\n\nWith teeth that poison if they bite,\n\nMastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,\n\nHound or spaniel, her or him,\n\nOr bobtail tike, or droopy-tail –\n\nTom will make him weep and wail:\n\n’Cos, with throwing thus my head,\n\nDogs hurry out, and all are fled.\n\nDo de, de, de. Be quiet! Come, let’s march to wakes and\n\nfairs and market towns! Poor Tom, you need a drink.\n\nLear Let them dissect Regan, to see what’s festering\n\naround her heart. Is there any natural cause for these hard\n\nhearts? [ To  Edgar ] You, sir, I’ll engage you as one of my\n\nhundred knights, though I don’t like the cut of your clothes.\n\nYou’ll say they are Persian-style, but change them.\n\nKent Now, good my lord, lie here and rest for a while.\n\nLear [ as if at home in bed ] Make no noise, make no noise.\n\nDraw the curtains. So, so. We’ll have our supper in the\n\nmorning.\n\nFool And I’ll go to bed at noon.\n\n[ Gloucester  returns ]\n\nGloucester [ to  Kent ] Come here, friend. Where is my master\n\nthe King?\n\nKent Here, sir. But don’t bother him. His mind has gone.\n\nGloucester Good friend, I beg of you: take him in your arms.\n\nI’ve overheard a plot to kill him. There’s a stretcher ready:\n\nlay him on it, and drive toward Dover, friend, where you’ll\n\nmeet both welcome and protection. Lift your master up. If\n\nyou dally half an hour, his life, and yours, and all who\n\nsupport him, are certain to be lost. Take him up, take him\n\nup, and follow me. I’ll give you guidance and provisions.\n\nKent Distress has induced sleep. This rest might have\n\nsoothed your tortured nerves. If circumstances won’t allow\n\nthat, a cure will not be easy. [ To the  Fool ] Come, help to\n\ncarry your master. You must not stay behind.\n\nGloucester Come: come away.\n\n[ Kent, Gloucester  and the  Fool  leave, carrying  Lear ]\n\nEdgar When we see our betters suffering from wretchedness,\n\nour own miseries seem more bearable. Lonely suffering is\n\nmostly in the mind, which it ceases to be carefree and\n\nhappy. However, the mind is relieved of much suffering\n\nwhen grief and adversity are shared. How tolerable my pain\n\nseems now, when I see the King break beneath a burden\n\nthat only puts a strain on me. He suffers from his children,\n\nas I do from my father! Tom, away! Note the rumors of great\n\nevents. Throw off your disguise when you are cleared of the\n\nfalse charges that shame you, and you are reconciled to your\n\nfather. Whatever else happens tonight, may the King make a\n\nsafe escape! Meanwhile, stay in hiding!\n\nScene 7\n\nA room in Gloucester’s castle.  Cornwall, Regan, Goneril, Edmund  and Servants enter.\n\nCornwall [ to  Goneril ] Send a messenger quickly to my lord,\n\nyour husband. Show him this letter. [ It is the one  Gloucester\n\nmentioned in Act 3 Scene 3 ] The French army has landed.\n\nGo and find the traitor Gloucester!\n\n[ Several Servants leave ]\n\nRegan Hang him instantly!\n\nGoneril Blind him!\n\nCornwall Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, stay with our\n\nsister Goneril. The revenge we are proposing to take on your\n\ntraitorous father is not fit for you to see. Tell the Duke,\n\nwhen you see him, to prepare for war. We’ll do the same.\n\nOur messengers will keep us fully and swiftly informed. [ To\n\nGoneril ] Farewell, dear sister. [ To  Edmund ] Farewell, my\n\nLord of Gloucester.\n\n[ Oswald  enters ]\n\nWell, where’s the King?\n\nOswald My Lord of Gloucester has taken him away. Some\n\nthree dozen or so of his knights, eagerly searching for him,\n\nmet him at the castle gate. With some more of Lord\n\nGloucester’s men, they have gone toward Dover, where\n\nthey claim they have well-armed friends.\n\nCornwall Get horses for your mistress.\n\nGoneril Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.\n\nCornwall Edmund, farewell.\n\n[ Goneril, Edmund  and  Oswald  leave ]\n\nGo and find the traitor Gloucester! Tie him up like a thief,\n\nand bring him to us.\n\n[ Several Servants respond ]\n\nThough we can’t condemn him to death without a trial, we\n\ncan indulge our anger. Men may deplore it, but not stop it.\n\nWho’s there? The traitor?\n\n[ Servants enter with  Gloucester  their prisoner ]\n\nRegan The ungrateful fox! It’s him!\n\nCornwall Tie his withered arms tight!\n\nGloucester What do your Graces mean? My dear friends,\n\nremember you are my guests. Do me no injury, friends.\n\nCornwall Tie him, I say!\n\n[ The Servants tie him up ]\n\nRegan Tight! Tight! Oh, you filthy traitor!\n\nGloucester Merciless lady that you are, I’m not!\n\nCornwall Bind him to this chair. Villain, you’ll find –\n\n[ Regan  pulls  Gloucester’s  beard ]\n\nGloucester By the kind gods, it’s extremely rude to pull me\n\nby the beard!\n\nRegan [ holding up some hair ] So white, and such a traitor!\n\nGloucester Wicked lady, those hairs you’ve snatched from my\n\nchin will come to life and accuse you. I am your host, and as\n\nsuch you shouldn’t abuse my hospitality like robbers. What\n\nare you going to do?\n\nCornwall Come, sir. What letters have you had recently from\n\nFrance?\n\nRegan A straight answer: we know the truth.\n\nCornwall How have you conspired with the traitors who’ve\n\nlanded recently in the kingdom?\n\nRegan To whom have you sent the lunatic King? Speak!\n\nGloucester I’ve had a vague sort of letter from a neutral\n\nsource, not from an enemy.\n\nCornwall Cunning!\n\nRegan And untrue!\n\nCornwall Where have you sent the King?\n\nGloucester To Dover.\n\nRegan Why to Dover? Weren’t you told under threat of\n\ndeath –\n\nCornwall Why to Dover? Let him answer that.\n\nGloucester I’m tied to a stake like a bear. I must stand being\n\nbaited.\n\nRegan Why to Dover?\n\nGloucester Because I couldn’t see your cruel nails pluck out\n\nhis poor old eyes, nor your fierce sister’s boarish fangs slash\n\nhis anointed flesh. Faced with a storm like the one his bare\n\nhead endured, during a night as black as hell, the sea itself\n\nwould have risen up and quenched the stars. Yet, poor\n\nold heart, he helped the heavens to rage. If wolves had\n\nhowled at your gate at that ghastly time, you would have\n\nsaid, “Good porter, let them in.” All other cruel creatures\n\nyield to compassion. I’ll see that divine vengeance overtakes\n\nsuch children as you!\n\nCornwall See it you never shall. [ To the Servants ] You\n\nfellows, hold the chair. I’ll stamp my foot upon those eyes of\n\nyours!\n\nGloucester [ struggling ] Anyone who hopes to reach old age:\n\nhelp me! [ Cornwall  blinds  Gloucester  in one eye with his\n\nboot ] Oh, cruel! Oh, gods!\n\nRegan One side will mock the other. The other, too!\n\nCornwall [ raising his foot ] If you see vengeance –\n\n1st Servant Hold it, my lord. I’ve served you ever since I was\n\na child; but I’ve never served you better than I do now in\n\ntelling you to stop!\n\nRegan What, you dog!\n\n1st Servant If you were a man, I’d fight you over this!\n\nRegan What do you mean?\n\nCornwall Villain! [ They fight ]\n\n1st Servant Right, then: come on. Take your chance against\n\nan angry man! [ Cornwall is wounded ]\n\nRegan [ to another Servant ] Give me your sword. A peasant to\n\npresume like this? [ She runs him through from behind ]\n\n1st Servant Oh, you’ve killed me! My lord, you’ve one eye left\n\nto see him come to a bad end. Oh! [ He dies ]\n\nCornwall In case it should see more, we’ll prevent it. [ He\n\ngouges out  Gloucester’s remaining eye] Out, you vile piece\n\nof jelly! Where’s your twinkle now?\n\nGloucester [ groaning ] All’s dark and comfortless. Where is\n\nmy son, Edmund? Edmund, summon all the energy of nature\n\nto revenge this horrid act!\n\nRegan Pah! You treacherous villain! You are appealing to\n\nsomeone who hates you. It was Edmund who disclosed your\n\ntreasons to us. He’s too good to pity you.\n\nGloucester Oh, my follies! Then Edgar was wronged. Kind\n\ngods, forgive me and make him prosper!\n\nRegan [ to a Servant ] Go and throw him out. Let him smell his\n\nway to Dover.\n\n[ Gloucester  is pushed out ]\n\nHow are you, my lord? Are you all right?\n\nCornwall I’ve been hurt. Follow me, lady. Turn that eyeless\n\nvillain out. Throw this wretch [ the dead servant ] on the\n\ndunghill. Regan, I’m bleeding badly. This wound has come\n\nat the wrong time. Give me your arm.\n\n[ Cornwall  leaves, supported by  Regan ]\n\n2nd Servant I don’t care what wickedness I do, if this man\n\nprospers!\n\n3rd Servant If she has a long life, and dies a natural death, all\n\nwomen will turn into monsters!\n\n2nd Servant Let’s follow the old Earl, and get the madman to\n\nguide him wherever he wants to go. Nobody will criticize\n\nwhat a madman does.\n\n3rd Servant You go. I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs to\n\nmake a plaster for his bleeding face. Now, heaven help him!\n\n[ They go separately ]\n\nAct four\n\nScene 1\n\nThe heath.  Edgar  enters.\n\nEdgar It’s better to be like this – openly despised – than what\n\nis worse: scorned but deceived by flattery. The most\n\nwretched and dejected victim of ill fortune always has some\n\nhope, and is proof against fear. What’s more distressing is\n\nto cease to enjoy life at its best; when things are at their\n\nworst, they can only improve. Welcome, then, to the natural\n\nelements that surround me. This man you’ve made so\n\nwretched with your fierce winds owes you no thanks. But\n\nwho comes here?\n\n[ Gloucester  enters, led by an  Old Man ]\n\nMy father, guided by a commoner? World, world, oh, world!\n\nIt’s hatred of your ups and downs that makes us reconciled\n\nto death.\n\nOld Man [ to  Gloucester ] Oh, my good lord! I’ve been your\n\ntenant, and your father’s tenant, these eighty years.\n\nGloucester Away, go away. Good friend, be gone. Your help\n\ncan do me no good at all. It may do you some harm.\n\nOld Man You can’t see your way.\n\nGloucester I have no way, and therefore need no eyes. I\n\nstumbled when I could see. Very often prosperity makes us\n\ncomplacent, and adversity proves to be an asset. Oh, dear\n\nson Edgar, the object of your deluded father’s anger, if I\n\ncould only live to see you by touching you, I’d say I had my\n\neyes again.\n\nOld Man [ noticing  Edgar ] Hello, who’s there?\n\nEdgar [ aside ] Oh, gods! Who can ever say, “I’ve hit the\n\nbottom?” I’m worse than I was before.\n\nOld Man [ to  Gloucester ] It’s poor mad Tom.\n\nEdgar [ aside ] And worse may still be to come. The worst has\n\nnot happened as long as we can say, “This is the worst.”\n\nOld Man Fellow, where are you going?\n\nGloucester Is it a beggar man?\n\nOld Man Lunatic and beggar, too.\n\nGloucester He must have some intelligence, or he couldn’t\n\nbeg. In last night’s storm I saw such a fellow, which made\n\nme think mankind’s no better than a worm. My son then\n\ncame into my mind, though I was angry with him in my\n\nthoughts. The gods treat us like naughty boys treat flies;\n\nthey kill us for the fun of it.\n\nEdgar [ aside, commenting on his father’s blindness ] What has\n\nhappened? It’s a bad business having to joke with a man in\n\ndistress. Both parties resent it. [ Aloud ] Bless you, master.\n\nGloucester Is that the naked fellow?\n\nOld Man Yes, my lord.\n\nGloucester Then, please: go now. If, for my sake, you will\n\ncatch up with us a mile or two away from here – on the way\n\nto Dover – do it for old time’s sake. And bring some clothes\n\nfor this naked soul, whom I shall ask to escort me.\n\nOld Man Alas, sir, he is mad.\n\nGloucester It’s a sign of the sick times, when the mad lead\n\nthe blind. Do as I say, or rather as you feel inclined. Above\n\nall, go!\n\nOld Man I’ll bring him the best clothes I’ve got, and take the\n\nconsequences.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nGloucester You there: the naked fellow!\n\nEdgar Poor Tom is cold. [ Aside ] I can’t keep this up –\n\nGloucester Come here, fellow.\n\nEdgar – but I must. [ Resuming his disguise ] Bless your sweet\n\neyes. They are bleeding.\n\nGloucester Do you know the way to Dover?\n\nEdgar Cross-country, bridle-path and footpath. Poor Tom has\n\nbeen scared out of his good wits. Bless you, laddie, from the\n\nfoul fiend! Five devils have been in Poor Tom together:\n\nBidicut, the lusty one; Hoberdidance, the prince of\n\ndumbness; Mahu, of stealing; Modo, of murder;\n\nFlibbertigibbet, of making strange faces. They’ve since\n\npossessed chambermaids and serving-women. So, bless\n\nyou, master!\n\nGloucester Here, take this purse, you who’ve become\n\nreconciled to fortune’s worst afflictions. My wretchedness\n\nmakes you the better off. Heavens, stick to your policy! May\n\nthe man who’s well-heeled and overindulgent – who\n\nabuses your kind favors – who refuses to see things\n\nbecause he does not feel them personally – quickly\n\nexperience your power! Spreading the wealth out would\n\nremedy excess. Every man would have enough. Do you\n\nknow Dover?\n\nEdgar Yes, master.\n\nGloucester There is a cliff whose great and brooding height\n\npeers fearfully into the pounding sea below. Just take me to\n\nthe very edge of it, and I’ll help to remedy your misery with\n\nsomething valuable I’m carrying. From there I’ll need no\n\nguide.\n\nEdgar Give me your arm. Poor Tom will lead you.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 2\n\nNear the Duke of Albany’s palace. Enter  Goneril  and  Edmund,  who have traveled from Gloucester’s castle together.\n\nGoneril Welcome, my lord. I’m amazed that my meek and mild\n\nhusband didn’t meet us on the way.\n\n[ Oswald  enters ]\n\nWhere’s your master?\n\nOswald Madam, he’s indoors. But never was a man so\n\nchanged. I told him about the army that has landed; he\n\nsmiled at it. I told him you were coming; his answer was,\n\n“So much the worse.” When I informed him of Gloucester’s\n\ntreachery, and of the loyal services of his son, he called me\n\nan idiot and told me I’d got it wrong way round. What he\n\nought to dislike seems pleasant to him; what he should like,\n\noffensive.\n\nGoneril [ to  Edmund ] Then you must go no further. He’s too\n\ncowardly to take any action; he’ll avoid provocation. The\n\nhopes we expressed on the way here may be fulfilled. Go\n\nback, Edmund, to my brother-in-law. Speed up recruitment\n\nand lead his army. I must change roles at home, and give my\n\nhusband the embroidery to do. [ Pointing to  Oswald ] This\n\ntrusty servant will be our go-between. Soon you may well\n\nhear – if you’re not afraid to do yourself some good – a\n\ncertain command from your mistress … [ Edmund’s  hand\n\ngoes to his dagger; he realizes  Goneril  is hinting at the\n\nmurder of  Albany ] Wear this; there’s no need to say\n\nanything. [ She puts a chain around his neck ] Lower your\n\nhead. [ She kisses him ] This kiss, if it dared to speak, would\n\nrouse you … Keep me in your thoughts, and goodbye.\n\nEdmund Yours ever, until death!\n\nGoneril My dearest Gloucester!\n\n[ Edmund  leaves ]\n\nOh, the difference between one man and another! You\n\ndeserve what a woman has to give. I have a fool for my\n\nbedfellow.\n\nOswald Madam, here comes my lord.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\n[ Albany  enters ]\n\nGoneril You would once have thought I was worth the trouble\n\nof coming to meet me.\n\nAlbany Oh, Goneril! You are not worth the dust that the harsh\n\nwind blows in your face! I distrust your character. A nature\n\nthat can deny a parent cannot hold itself in check. As one\n\nwho has cut herself off from the main branch, you must of\n\nnecessity wither and die.\n\nGoneril Say no more. Your sermon is a silly one.\n\nAlbany Wisdom and goodness always seem vile to the vile.\n\nTo the filthy everything seems filthy. What have you done?\n\nTigers rather than daughters, what have you been up to? A\n\nfather, and a gracious elderly man – that even a captive\n\nbear would lick with reverence – you have barbarously and\n\ndegenerately made insane. How could my brother-in-law\n\nallow you to do it? A man – a prince – who owed so much\n\nto him! If the gods don’t quickly intervene by sending down\n\ntheir agents to punish these vile offenses, then surely men\n\nwill start eating each other, like the monsters of the sea!\n\nGoneril You coward, you’ll let anyone push you around! You\n\ncan’t distinguish between the tolerable and the insufferable.\n\nYou don’t realize that only fools pity villains who are\n\npunished before they do their mischief. Where’s your call to\n\narms? The King of France raises his flags in our docile\n\nland; the threat of war hangs over your country while you, a\n\nmoralizing fool, sit there and cry, “Alas, why is he doing\n\nthis?”\n\nAlbany See yourself for what you are, devil! Depravity, bad\n\nenough when seen in the fiend, is even more horrid in a\n\nwoman!\n\nGoneril You worthless idiot!\n\nAlbany You transformed and self-deceiving thing, for shame!\n\nStop acting like a monster! If I were inclined to let my\n\nemotions govern my behavior, these hands would tear your\n\nflesh and bones apart! Fiend though you are, your female\n\nform protects you.\n\nGoneril [ contemptuously ] You and your manhood! Pah!\n\n[ A  Messenger  enters ]\n\nAlbany What’s your news?\n\nMessenger Oh, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall is dead:\n\nkilled by his servant as he was putting out Gloucester’s\n\nother eye.\n\nAlbany Gloucester’s eyes!\n\nMessenger One of his servants, moved by compassion, made\n\nobjection, raising his sword against his great master.\n\nFurious at this, he [ the Duke ] attacked him, and the man\n\nwas struck dead; but not before the Duke sustained a mortal\n\nwound that later took his life.\n\nAlbany [ addressing the heavens ] This proves you are there\n\nabove, you judges, in that our worldly crimes are so\n\nspeedily revenged! But oh, poor Gloucester! Did he lose\n\nhis other eye?\n\nMessenger Both, my lord, both. [ To  Goneril ] This letter,\n\nmadam, requires a speedy answer. It’s from your sister.\n\nGoneril [ aside ] In one sense, I like this. However, she being a\n\nwidow and my Gloucester with her, all my dreams for the\n\nfuture could collapse in ruins. Looking at it another way, the\n\nnews is not so grievous. [ Aloud ] I’ll read it and answer it.\n\n[ She goes ]\n\nAlbany Where was his son when they blinded him?\n\nMessenger On his way here with my lady.\n\nAlbany He isn’t here.\n\nMessenger No, my good lord. I met him on his way back.\n\nAlbany Does he know about the wickedness?\n\nMessenger Yes, my good lord. It was he who informed\n\nagainst him [ his father ]. He left the house on purpose so\n\nthat they would have a free hand with their punishment.\n\nAlbany Gloucester, I live to thank you for the love that you\n\nhave shown the King, and to revenge your eyes! [ To the\n\nMessenger ] Come here, friend. Tell me what more you\n\nknow.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 3\n\nThe French camp near Dover. Enter  Kent  and a  Gentleman.\n\nKent Have you no idea why the King of France has returned\n\nso suddenly?\n\nGentleman He remembered something he’d forgotten to do in\n\nhis own kingdom which had such risky complications that\n\nhis return was vital and necessary.\n\nKent Which general has he left in charge?\n\nGentleman The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.\n\nKent Did your letters move Cordelia to any show of grief?\n\nGentleman Yes, sir. She took them, and read them in my\n\npresence. Every now and then a large tear trickled down her\n\nsoft cheek. She governed her emotions like a queen; they,\n\nlike rebels, tried to play the superior role of king.\n\nKent Oh, then she was moved by it?\n\nGentleman Not to distraction. Self-control vied with sorrow\n\nas to which should show more attractively in her face. You\n\nhave seen sunshine and rain happen together. Her smiles\n\nand tears were similar, but more attractive. The happy little\n\nsmiles that played on her ruby lips seemed unaware of the\n\ntears that lodged in her eyes. They fell like pearls dropping\n\nfrom diamonds. In short, sorrow would be a precious rarity if\n\nit were always as becoming as it was in her case.\n\nKent Did she ask no questions?\n\nGentleman Indeed, once or twice she gasped the name\n\n“Father” as if it pressed upon her heart. She cried, “Sisters!\n\nSisters! Disgrace to womanhood! Sisters! Kent! Father!\n\nSisters! What – in the storm? At night? For pity’s sake, it’s\n\nunbelievable!” At that point she let her holy tears fall from\n\nher heavenly eyes. Then away she went, calmed by her\n\noutburst, to cope with her grief in private.\n\nKent It’s the stars, the stars above us, who decide our\n\ncharacters! Otherwise parents couldn’t beget such different\n\nchildren. You’ve not spoken to her since?\n\nGentleman No.\n\nKent Was this before the King returned to France?\n\nGentleman No, after.\n\nKent Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear has reached Dover.\n\nSometimes in his more lucid moments he remembers why\n\nwe are here, and won’t in any circumstances consent to see\n\nhis daughter.\n\nGentleman Why, sir?\n\nKent An overpowering shame pushes him away. His\n\nown unkindness – which lost her his blessing, turned her\n\nout to live abroad as best she could, and gave her dowry to\n\nhis pitiless daughters – these things sting his mind so\n\npoisonously that he’s held back from Cordelia by a burning\n\nsense of shame.\n\nGentleman Alas, poor gentleman!\n\nKent You haven’t heard anything of the armies of Albany and\n\nCornwall?\n\nGentleman Yes. They are on the march.\n\nKent Well, sir, I’ll bring you to our master, Lear, and leave you\n\nto look after him. Important business will keep me privately\n\noccupied for some time. When I resume my real name, you\n\nwon’t be sorry you associated with me like this. Please,\n\ncome with me.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 4\n\nThe French camp near Dover.  Cordelia  enters with a  Doctor  and Soldiers.\n\nCordelia Alas, it’s he. He was found just now, as mad as the\n\nraging sea, singing aloud, with a crown of luxuriant fumitory\n\n[ an herb ] and common weeds – burdocks, hemlock, nettles,\n\ncuckoo-flowers, coarse grasses, and all the worthless\n\nweeds that grow among our health-giving corn. Send out\n\na troop of soldiers; search every acre in the fields of crops,\n\nand bring him to our sight.\n\n[ An Officer leaves ]\n\nWhat can man’s learning do to restore his lost reason? I’d\n\ngive all I possess to the man who can cure him.\n\nDoctor There is a way, madam. Sleep is nature’s\n\nnourishment, which he lacks. To induce it, there are many\n\neffective medicinal herbs, with the power to put pain to\n\nsleep.\n\nCordelia May all the blessed secrets and little-known\n\nremedies of the earth germinate with my tears! Be helpful\n\nand curative in the good man’s distress! Look, look for him,\n\nin case in his frenzy he ends a life that lacks the means to\n\nsurvive.\n\n[ Messenger  enters ]\n\nMessenger News, madam. The British army is marching\n\ntoward you.\n\nCordelia We know that. We are ready for them. Oh, dear\n\nfather! It is your interests I’m pursuing. That’s why my royal\n\nhusband has pitied my sorrowful and pleading tears. We\n\naren’t roused to war by puffed-up ambition, but by love,\n\ndear love, and our old father’s rights. May I soon hear and\n\nsee him!\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 5\n\nA room in Gloucester’s castle.  Regan  enters, followed by  Oswald,  who is carrying a letter.\n\nRegan Have my brother-in-law’s troops set out?\n\nOswald Yes, madam.\n\nRegan Himself there in person?\n\nOswald Madam, after a lot of fuss. Your sister is the better\n\nsoldier.\n\nRegan Lord Edmund didn’t speak to your lord at his home?\n\nOswald No, madam.\n\nRegan What was behind my sister’s letter to him?\n\nOswald I don’t know, lady.\n\nRegan Indeed, he has gone off on important business. It was\n\nstupid to let Gloucester live after he was blinded. Wherever\n\nhe goes he turns all hearts against us. Edmund, I think, has\n\ngone to end his father’s darkened life out of pity for his\n\nmisery, as well as to determine the strength of the enemy.\n\nOswald I must go after him, madam, with my letter.\n\nRegan Our troops set out tomorrow. Stay with us. It’s\n\ndangerous outside.\n\nOswald I must not, madam. My lady put me on special trust\n\nwith this business.\n\nRegan Why should she write to Edmund? Couldn’t you\n\nconvey her message by word of mouth? Probably some\n\nthings – [ she breaks off, not wishing to express her\n\nsuspicion that  Goneril  and  Edmund  are lovers ] I don’t know\n\nwhat … I’d very much appreciate it … Let me open the\n\nletter.\n\nOswald Madam, I’d rather –\n\nRegan I know your lady doesn’t love her husband. I’m sure of\n\nthat. When she was here recently, she gave knowing\n\nglances and meaningful looks to noble Edmund. I know you\n\nhave her confidence.\n\nOswald I, madam?\n\nRegan I know what I’m talking about. You have, I know it.\n\nTherefore I advise you: take note of this. My lord is dead.\n\nEdmund and I have come to an understanding, and he’s\n\nmore available to me than he is to your lady. You know what\n\nI’m getting at. If you find him, give him this. [ She hands\n\nOswald  a ring ] And when your mistress hears what I’ve told\n\nyou, I suggest you advise her to act sensibly. So, goodbye.\n\nIf you happen to hear of that blind traitor, there’s promotion\n\nfor the one who ends his life.\n\nOswald If only I could meet him, madam. I’d show where my\n\nloyalty lies.\n\nRegan Fare you well.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 6\n\nThe countryside near Dover.  Gloucester  enters, led by  Edgar,  who is now dressed like a peasant.\n\nGloucester When shall I reach the top of the hill?\n\nEdgar You’re climbing up it now. Notice how hard it’s getting.\n\nGloucester I think the ground is level.\n\nEdgar It’s horribly steep. Listen! Do you hear the sea?\n\nGloucester Frankly, no.\n\nEdgar Well then, your other senses are growing imperfect\n\nthrough the pain in your eyes.\n\nGloucester It may be so, indeed. I think your voice is altered,\n\nand that you speak more coherently than you used to.\n\nEdgar You’ve got it wrong. I’m the same as before except for\n\nmy clothing.\n\nGloucester I think you are better spoken.\n\nEdgar Come on, sir. Here’s the place. Stand still. [ He has\n\nstopped in the middle of a field, though he pretends he is at\n\nthe edge of a cliff ] How frightening and dizzy-making it is to\n\nlook so far down! The crows and jackdaws that fly a\n\nmiddling height look hardly as big as beetles. Halfway down\n\nthere’s a man gathering samphire [ a European plant ]. What\n\na dreadful job! He looks to me no bigger than his head. The\n\nfishermen walking on the beach look like mice, and that tall\n\nship at anchor over there is reduced to the size of her tender,\n\nand her tender a buoy almost too small to be seen. The\n\nmurmuring waves that agitate the countless, useless\n\npebbles cannot be heard from this height. I’ll look no more,\n\nin case it turns my head, and blurred sight makes me topple\n\nheadlong down.\n\nGloucester Put me where you are.\n\nEdgar Give me your hand. You are now within a foot of the\n\nextreme edge. For all the world, I wouldn’t jump up and\n\ndown.\n\nGloucester Let go my hand. Here, friend, is another purse. In\n\nit there’s a jewel worth a lot to a poor man. May good\n\nfortune see you enjoy it! Go further away. Say goodbye, and\n\nlet me hear you go.\n\nEdgar [ pretending to go ] Goodbye, good sir.\n\nGloucester With all my heart.\n\nEdgar [ aside ] The reason I’m trifling with his misery like this is\n\nto cure it.\n\nGloucester [ kneeling ] Oh, you mighty gods! I renounce the\n\nworld, and in your sight uncomplainingly rid myself of my\n\ngreat suffering. Even if I could bear it longer, and not fall\n\ninto quarreling with your great and absolute decrees, the\n\nsmoldering wick and hatred end of my life would fizzle out.\n\nIf Edgar is alive, oh, bless him! [ To  Edgar ] Now, fellow:\n\nfare you well.\n\n[ He throws himself forward, as if over a cliff ]\n\nEdgar [ pretending to be at a distance ] Gone, sir. Farewell!\n\n[ To himself ] Possibly one can be deluded into death when\n\nthere’s no will to live. If he had been where he thought he\n\nwas, thought would by now be a thing of the past. Is he\n\nalive, or dead? [ To  Gloucester ] Hello, sir! Friend! Do you\n\nhear me, sir? Speak! [ To himself ] He might indeed have\n\ndied. [ Gloucester  stirs ] But he’s recovering! [ Now\n\npretending he is a fisherman at the foot of the cliff ] Who are\n\nyou, sir?\n\nGloucester Go away, and leave me to die.\n\nEdgar If you’d been anything other than gossamer, feathers,\n\nor air, you’d be shattered like an egg after falling from such\n\na height! But you are breathing; you are solid; you aren’t\n\nbleeding; you can speak; you are in one piece. You have\n\nfallen more than the height of ten ships’ masts. It’s a\n\nmiracle you are alive. Say something more.\n\nGloucester Have I fallen, or not?\n\nEdgar From the very top of this chalky cliff. Look right up\n\nthere: you can’t see or hear the shrill-voiced lark at that\n\ndistance. Just look up!\n\nGloucester Alas, I have no eyes. Is wretchedness deprived of\n\nthe benefit of ending itself by death? It was some small\n\ncomfort when misery could thwart the anger of a tyrant, and\n\nfrustrate his lofty plans.\n\nEdgar Give me your arm. [ He helps  Gloucester  to stand ] Up,\n\nso; how goes it? Can you feel your legs? You are standing\n\nup!\n\nGloucester Only too well, too well.\n\nEdgar This is quite remarkable. On the edge of the cliff, what\n\nwas that object who left you?\n\nGloucester A poor unfortunate beggar.\n\nEdgar As I stood here below, I thought his eyes were two full\n\nmoons. He had a thousand noses. He had horns that were\n\nbent and twisted like the wavy sea. It was some devil.\n\nTherefore, you lucky old man, assume that the righteous\n\ngods, who are revered for doing the impossible, have\n\npreserved you.\n\nGloucester I remember now. In future, I’ll bear suffering till it\n\ndecides I’ve endured enough, and lets me die. That thing\n\nyou spoke of I thought was a man. It often said, “The fiend,\n\nthe fiend.” He led me to that place.\n\nEdgar Put your mind at rest. But who comes here?\n\n[ Lear  enters, ornately dressed with wild flowers. He has lost\n\nhis reason ]\n\nNo man in his right mind would ever get himself up like this.\n\nLear No, they can’t accuse me of counterfeiting. I am the\n\nKing himself!\n\nEdgar What a heartbreaking sight!\n\nLear In matters of that sort, art takes second place to the real\n\nthing! [ As if to a recruit ] There’s your King’s shilling!\n\n[ Jumping from one delusion to another ] That man there\n\nhandles his bow like a scarecrow. Draw that bowstring out\n\na full arm’s length! [ He spots something at his feet ] Look,\n\nlook, a mouse! Sh! Sh! This piece of toasted cheese will\n\ncatch it. [ He tears off an imaginary chunk, then suddenly\n\nthrows it to the ground ] There’s my gauntlet; I’d challenge a\n\ngiant even. [ He’s a general now ] Bring up the pikemen! [ He\n\nfollows an imaginary arrow in its flight ] Oh, well-flown, bird!\n\nA bull’s eye, a bull’s eye! Swish! [ Noticing  Edgar ] Give the\n\npassword.\n\nEdgar Sweet marjoram.\n\nLear Pass.\n\nGloucester I know that voice.\n\nLear [ peering at him ] Aha, Goneril with a white beard! They\n\nflattered me like fawning dogs, and told me I was a shrewd\n\none even before I grew my first beard. To think they said\n\n“Yes” and “No” to everything I said! “Yes” and “No” isn’t\n\nsound theology. When the rain came to drench me once,\n\nand the wind made me shiver, when the thunder wouldn’t\n\nstop when I told it to, then I rumbled them; that’s when I\n\nsmelt them out! Pah, they’re not men of their words. They\n\ntold me I was all-powerful. It was a lie. I’m not immune from\n\nsickness.\n\nGloucester The tone of that voice I well remember. Are you\n\nnot the King?\n\nLear Yes, every inch a king! When I look hard at a man, see\n\nhow he trembles! I pardon that man’s life. What was your\n\ncrime? Adultery? You shall not die. Die for adultery? No,\n\neven the wren goes to it, and the little gold-colored fly does\n\nit in front of my eyes. Let copulation prosper; Gloucester’s\n\nbastard son was kinder to his father than my legitimate\n\ndaughters. Get at it, lust, flat out. I need soldiers! Look at\n\nthat innocent-looking female, whose face suggests she’s\n\nfrigid, who looks so goody-goody, who deplores all sexy\n\ntalk; polecats and stallions aren’t so hungry for it! From the\n\nwaist down they’re animals, albeit they’re women higher up.\n\nThe gods hold sway down to the belt; below is all the\n\ndevil’s. There is hell; there is darkness; there is the\n\nsulphurous pit – burning, scalding; stench, corruption! [ His\n\nmind is tormented with horror and repugnance ] Ugh, ugh,\n\nugh! Pah! Pah! [ To  Gloucester ] Give me an ounce of\n\nperfume, dear chemist, to sweeten my imagination! There’s\n\nsome money for you.\n\nGloucester Oh, let me kiss your hand.\n\nLear Let me wipe it first. It smells of death.\n\nGloucester Oh, what a ruin of a man! So too will the universe\n\ncome to its end. Do you know me?\n\nLear I remember your eyes well enough. Are you squinting at\n\nme? No, do your worst, blind sinfulness; I won’t indulge.\n\n[ Obsessed with  Gloucester’s  affliction ] Read this challenge.\n\nNote how it’s written.\n\nGloucester If all the letters were suns, I could not see them.\n\nEdgar [ aside ] I wouldn’t believe this if I heard about it. But it’s\n\na fact, and my heart breaks at it.\n\nLear Read.\n\nGloucester What, with holes for eyes?\n\nLear Oh, ho! Is that your game? No eyes in your head, and no\n\nmoney in your purse? Sad for your eyes; bad for your purse.\n\nBut that’s the way of the world, you see.\n\nGloucester I see by the feel of things.\n\nLear What, are you mad? A man doesn’t need eyes to see\n\nhow this world goes. Look with your ears. See how that\n\nmagistrate rebukes that humble thief. A word in your ear:\n\nSwitch places, and – take your choice – which is the\n\nmagistrate, which the thief? You’ve seen a farmer’s dog\n\nbark at a beggar?\n\nGloucester Yes, sir.\n\nLear And the man run away from the cur? That symbolizes\n\nAuthority: a dog is obeyed when it’s got an official position.\n\n[ Addressing an imaginary officer of the law ] You rascally\n\nconstable, stay your blood-stained hand! Why are you\n\nlashing that whore? Strip the skin off your own back; you’re\n\nlusting for the very thing you’re whipping her for. The big\n\ncrook hangs the petty one. The petty crimes of the poor are\n\nalways obvious; robes and fur-lined gowns hide everything.\n\nCover sin with gold armor, and the strong lance of justice\n\nshatters on contact. Cover it with rags, and the puny\n\nweapon of a pigmy will pierce through it. Nobody sins:\n\nnobody, I say, nobody; I’ll vouch for them. Take my word for\n\nit, my friend: I who have the power to silence all\n\nprosecutors. Get youself glass eyes. Like a vile opportunist,\n\npretend to see what you actually cannot. [ As if talking to\n\nhis valet ] Now, now, now, now – pull off my boots! Harder,\n\nharder; that’s right.\n\nEdgar [ aside ] Sense and nonsense combined. Sanity in\n\nmadness!\n\nLear If you want to weep for my misfortunes, have my eyes. I\n\nknow you well enough. Your name is Gloucester. You must\n\nbe patient. We came crying into this world; you know, the\n\nfirst time that we smell the air we wail and cry. I’ll preach to\n\nyou – listen.\n\nGloucester Alas, alas the day!\n\nLear When we are born, we cry because we’ve come to this\n\ngreat stage of fools. [ He stands on a tree stump to continue\n\nhis “sermon” ] This is a good mounting-block! It would be\n\nan ingenious idea to shoe a troop of horses with felt. I must\n\ngive it a try. And when I’ve crept up behind these\n\nsons-in-law, then [ he jumps down, shouting ] kill, kill, kill,\n\nkill, kill, kill!\n\n[ A  Gentleman  enters, with Attendants ]\n\nGentleman Oh, here he is. Take hold of him. Sir, your most\n\ndear daughter –\n\nLear [ thinking he has been captured in war ] No rescue? What,\n\na prisoner? I was born unlucky. Treat me well. You shall\n\nhave ransom. Get me doctors. My head’s split.\n\nGentleman You shall have whatever you want.\n\nLear No supporters? Just me alone? Why, this would make a\n\nman cry salt tears, to have his eyes used for garden\n\nwatering-cans, yes, and to lay the dust of autumn. I shall die\n\nsplendidly, like a bridegroom all dressed up. What, I’ll be\n\njovial! Come, come, I am a king, gentlemen. Do you realize\n\nthat?\n\nGentleman You are a royal person, and we obey you.\n\nLear Then there’s still hope. Come, if you want it, you’ll have\n\nto run for it! [ He runs off , making noises like a hunter ] Sa,\n\nsa, sa, sa! [ The Attendants pursue him ]\n\nGentleman A most pitiful sight even if it featured the lowliest\n\nof wretches: it’s beyond words when it involves a king! You\n\nhave one daughter who redeems nature from the universal\n\ncurse her two sisters have brought upon it.\n\nEdgar Greetings, sir!\n\nGentleman Sir, my compliments: what can I do for you?\n\nEdgar Have you heard anything, sir, of an impending battle?\n\nGentleman Certainly; it’s common knowledge. Everyone’s\n\nheard about it who isn’t deaf.\n\nEdgar But, if I may ask: how near is the other army?\n\nGentleman Very near, and advancing swiftly. We expect to\n\nsee the main body any hour now.\n\nEdgar Thank you, sir: that’s all.\n\nGentleman Though the Queen is here for special reasons, her\n\narmy has moved on.\n\nEdgar I thank you, sir.\n\n[ The  Gentleman  leaves ]\n\nGloucester You ever-merciful gods, take my life. Don’t let my\n\nevil side tempt me again to die before it’s your will!\n\nEdgar Well prayed, father.\n\nGloucester Now, good sir, who are you?\n\nEdgar A very poor man, broken by misfortune. Experience of\n\nsorrow has predisposed me toward pity. Give me your\n\nhand. I’ll lead you to some shelter.\n\nGloucester Hearty thanks. May the bounty and blessing of\n\nheaven reward you, in addition to my gratitude.\n\n[ Oswald  enters ]\n\nOswald A man with a price on his head! Most fortunate! That\n\neyeless head of yours was preordained to make my fortune!\n\nYou miserable old traitor, think of your sins. [ He draws his\n\nsword from its scabbard ] The sword is out that must\n\ndestroy you.\n\nGloucester [ ready to die ] Thrust hard with your friendly hand.\n\n[ Edgar  steps forward in his father’s defense ]\n\nOswald You impertinent peasant, how dare you defend an\n\noutlawed traitor? Go, before you suffer the same fate as\n\nhim. Let go his arm.\n\nEdgar [ assuming a regional accent ] I’ll not let go, sir, without\n\na better reason.\n\nOswald Let go, wretch, or you’ll die.\n\nEdgar Good gentleman, be on your way, and let us poor folk\n\nmove on. If I could have been cheated out of my life, I’d\n\nhave lost it weeks ago. No, don’t come near the old man.\n\nKeep off, I tell you, or I’ll test which is harder – your head or\n\nmy stick. That’s the truth.\n\nOswald Get away, you slob!\n\nEdgar I’ll pick your teeth for you, sir. Come on, I’m not scared\n\nof your sword-thrusts. [ They fight;  Edgar  knocks  Oswald\n\ndown ]\n\nOswald Wretch, you’ve killed me. Peasant, take my purse. If\n\nyou ever hope to prosper, bury my body. Give the letters\n\nyou’ll find on me to Edmund, Earl of Gloucester. Find him on\n\nthe English side. Oh, such untimely death! Death … [ He\n\ndies ]\n\nEdgar I know you well. An unscrupulous villain, as dutiful in\n\nserving the vices of your mistress as wickedness could\n\ndesire.\n\nGloucester What, is he dead?\n\nEdgar Sit down, father, and rest. Let’s see what’s in these\n\npockets; the letters he referred to might do me some good.\n\n[ As he searches, he answers  Gloucester’s  question ] He’s\n\ndead. I am only sorry he didn’t have some other executioner.\n\n[ He finds the letter ] Let’s see. [ He breaks the seal ] If I may,\n\ndear wax! Don’t say this is bad manners; to know what’s in\n\nour enemies’ minds, we rip their hearts. Ripping open their\n\nletters is more lawful. [ He reads the contents aloud ]\n\nRemember our mutual vows. You’ll have many\n\nchances to do away with him. If you’ve got the\n\ndetermination, there’ll be ample time and opportunity.\n\nIf he comes back the victor, we shall have achieved\n\nnothing. Then I would be his prisoner, and our marital\n\nbed would be my jail. Save me from the intimate\n\nhorror of that, and assure yourself of physical\n\ncontentment.\n\nYour wife, as I would wish, and\n\nDevoted lover,\n\nGoneril.\n\nOh, how infinite is woman’s lust! A plot to kill her virtuous\n\nhusband, and my brother to replace him! [ Addressing\n\nOswald ] Here, in these sands, the unholy burial-place of\n\nmurderous lechers, I’ll cover your body up. When the time is\n\nripe, I’ll show this wicked letter to the Duke, whose life is\n\nthreatened. It’s fortunate for him that I can report both your\n\ndeath and the business you were about.\n\nGloucester The King is mad. How obstinate my mind is, that I\n\nshould stay sane, and be conscious of my great distress! It\n\nwould be better if I were mad; then my thoughts and my\n\ngriefs would be separated, and in my fantasies woes would\n\ncease to have any meaning.\n\n[ The sound of drums is heard ]\n\nEdgar Give me your hand. I think I can hear drum-beats in the\n\ndistance. Come, father: I’ll leave you with a friend.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 7\n\nA tent in the French camp.  Cordelia, Kent, Doctor  and a  Gentleman  enter.\n\nCordelia Oh good Kent! How shall I live and work to equal\n\nyour goodness? My life will be too short, and I’ll fail by every\n\nstandard.\n\nKent To be appreciated, madam, is to be overpaid. All I’ve\n\ndescribed is the honest truth, no more, no less, just as it is.\n\nCordelia Change your clothes. These garments are reminders\n\nof those bad times. Please, take them off.\n\nKent With respect, madam, to be recognized now runs\n\ncounter to my plans. I’d ask the favor of your not knowing\n\nme till I think the time is right.\n\nCordelia So be it, my good lord. [ To the  Doctor ] How is the\n\nKing?\n\nDoctor Madam, he’s still sleeping.\n\nCordelia Oh, you kind gods, cure this great fracture in his\n\ntormented mind! Tune the discordant senses of this childlike\n\nfather!\n\nDoctor Would your Majesty allow us to wake the King? He\n\nhas slept long.\n\nCordelia Act according to your knowledge of these things. Do\n\nas you think best. Is he dressed?\n\n[ Lear  enters in a chair carried by Servants ]\n\nGentleman Yes, madam. While he was fast asleep we put\n\nclean clothes on him.\n\nDoctor Be at his side, good madam, when we waken him. I\n\ndo not doubt that he’ll be normal.\n\nCordelia Very well.\n\n[ Soft music is played ]\n\nDoctor [ to the Servants ] Come nearer. Play louder there!\n\nCordelia Oh, my dear father! May my lips convey healing, and\n\nlet this kiss cure the damage that my two sisters have done\n\nto you. [ She kisses him on the forehead ]\n\nKent Kind and dear Princess!\n\nCordelia [ stroking his hair ] Even if they were not of your own\n\nbegetting, these snowy locks would merit pity. Was this a\n\nface to battle with antagonistic winds? To withstand the\n\nthunderbolts of deep-throated thunder? To be in the midst\n\nof flashes of terrifying lightning? To be up at night – poor\n\nhopeless one! – with this thin head-covering? My enemy’s\n\ndog, even if it had bitten me, would have had a place in\n\nfront of my fire that night. Were you obliged, poor father, to\n\nslum it with swine and homeless vagabonds, in scanty and\n\nmusty-smelling straw? Alas, alas! It’s amazing that your life\n\nand your sanity didn’t succumb together. He is waking.\n\nSpeak to him.\n\nDoctor Madam, do you. It’s best.\n\nCordelia How is my royal lord? How fares your Majesty?\n\nLear It’s wrong of you to take me out of the grave. You are a\n\nsoul in a state of bliss; but I am in hell, tied to a wheel of\n\nfire. My own tears scald like molten lead.\n\nCordelia Sir, do you know me?\n\nLear You are a spirit, I know. Where did you die?\n\nCordelia [ to the  Doctor ] He is still confused.\n\nDoctor He’s hardly awake. Leave him alone a moment.\n\nLear Where have I been? Where am I? Is this real daylight? I\n\nwas mightily deluded. I’d die with pity to see someone else\n\nlike this. I don’t know what to say. I’m not sure these are\n\nmy hands – let’s see. [ He winces as he tests with the point\n\nof a brooch ] I feel this pin-prick. I wish I could sort things\n\nout.\n\nCordelia Oh, look at me, sir, and hold your hand in blessing\n\nover me!\n\n[ Lear  looks at her, then falls at her feet ]\n\nNo, sir: you must not kneel!\n\nLear Please, do not mock me. I am a very foolish old man, in\n\nhis dotage; over 80 years old, not an hour more or less. To\n\ntell you frankly, I’m afraid I’m not in my right mind. I think I\n\nshould know you and this man, but I am uncertain. I’m\n\nentirely ignorant about what this place is, and even if I try\n\nvery hard I can’t remember these clothes; nor do I know\n\nwhere I stayed last night. Do not laugh at me; as I’m a man,\n\nI think this lady is my child Cordelia.\n\nCordelia And so I am, I am!\n\nLear Are your tears wet? [ He tries them ] Yes, indeed. Please\n\ndon’t weep. If you have poison for me, I will drink it. I know\n\nyou do not love me. Your sisters have, now I remember,\n\ndone me wrong. You have some cause. They have not.\n\nCordelia [ shaking her head, weeping ] No cause, no cause.\n\nLear [ to  Kent ] Am I in France?\n\nKent In your own kingdom, sir.\n\nLear Do not mock me.\n\nDoctor Take comfort, madam. The delirium, you see, has\n\nsubsided in him. It’s dangerous to fill in the gaps in his\n\nmemory. Request him to go in. Don’t trouble him any more\n\ntill he’s calmer.\n\nCordelia Would your Highness like to walk? [ She offers her\n\narm ]\n\nLear You must be patient with me. Please now: forget and\n\nforgive. I am old and foolish.\n\n[ Lear, Cordelia, Doctor  and Attendants leave ]\n\nGentleman Is it a fact that the Duke of Cornwall was killed\n\nlike that?\n\nKent Absolutely, sir.\n\nGentleman Who has taken command of his people?\n\nKent The bastard son of Gloucester, so it’s said.\n\nGentleman They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl\n\nof Kent in Germany.\n\nKent Rumors come and go. We must prepare. The armies of\n\nthe kingdom will soon be here.\n\nGentleman The battle is likely to be a bloody one. Farewell, sir.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nKent The full stop at the end of my life will be placed for good\n\nor ill according to the outcome of today’s battle.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nAct five\n\nScene 1\n\nThe British camp at Dover. Enter  Edmund, Regan,  Officers, Soldiers and others .\n\nEdmund [ to an Officer ] Find out from the Duke if he’s sticking\n\nto his last plan, or whether he’s had any reason to alter\n\ncourse. He changes his mind all the time and is full of\n\ninsecurity. Bring his final decision.\n\n[ The Officer salutes and goes ]\n\nRegan Our sister’s steward has come to some harm.\n\nEdmund I’m afraid so, madam.\n\nRegan Now, sweet lord, you know that I intend to do you\n\nsome good. Tell me, honestly, even if it’s unpalatable: don’t\n\nyou love my sister?\n\nEdmund In an honorable way.\n\nRegan [ trying to be delicate about personal matters ] But have\n\nyou never trespassed on my brother-in-law’s territory?\n\nEdmund That thought is worrying you.\n\nRegan I suspect you may have got very close to her … gone\n\nall the way …\n\nEdmund No, on my honor, madam!\n\nRegan I couldn’t tolerate her. Dear my lord, don’t be intimate\n\nwith her.\n\nEdmund Don’t worry about me. [ A drum sounds ] Here she is,\n\nwith the Duke her husband!\n\n[ Albany  and  Goneril  enter, followed by Soldiers ]\n\nGoneril [ aside ] I’d rather lose the battle than have my sister\n\ncome between him and me.\n\nAlbany [ bowing politely to  Regan ] Our very loving sister:\n\ngreetings. [ To  Edmund ] Sir, I hear this: the King has gone to\n\nhis daughter, along with others forced to defect as a result\n\nof our harsh rule. I’ve never had any stomach for shady\n\nmatters. As for this business, it concerns us only because\n\nFrance invades our land: not that we wish to confront the\n\nKing and those others whose genuine grievances, I fear,\n\nmake them opposed to us.\n\nEdmund Sir, you speak nobly.\n\nRegan Why bother to say all this?\n\nGoneril Unite against the enemy; these family and private\n\nquarrels are irrelevant.\n\nAlbany Then let’s consult the experts on our tactics.\n\nEdmund I’ll join you at your tent immediately. [ He makes to\n\nleave ]\n\nRegan Sister, you’ll go with us?\n\nGoneril No.\n\nRegan It’s only right that you should. Go with us.\n\nGoneril [ aside ] Oh, yes. I know your game … [ She suspects\n\nher sister does not trust her alone with  Edmund ] I’ll go.\n\n[ Before anyone can leave , Edgar  enters, disguised ]\n\nEdgar [ to  Albany ] If your Grace would deign to speak to so\n\npoor a man, may I have a word with you?\n\nAlbany [ indicating to the others to carry on ] I’ll catch up with\n\nyou.\n\n[ Edmund, Regan, Goneril,  Officers , Soldiers and Attendants\n\nleave ]\n\nEdgar [ to  Albany ] Before you fight the battle, open this letter.\n\nIf you win, sound the trumpet to summon me. Humble\n\nthough I seem, I can produce a champion who will prove\n\nwhat is said here. If you lose, you won’t be concerned about\n\nworldly things, and there all matters will end. Good luck!\n\nAlbany Stay till I’ve read the letter.\n\nEdgar I was forbidden to. At the appropriate time, just let the\n\nherald’s trumpet sound, and I’ll appear again.\n\nAlbany Well, fare you well. I’ll read your letter.\n\n[ Edgar  goes ]\n\n[ Edmund  returns ]\n\nEdmund The enemy is in sight. Bring up your troops.\n\n[ Handing  Albany  a note ] Here’s the estimate of their\n\nequipment and numbers, determined by our scouts. You\n\nmust be quick now.\n\nAlbany We’ll rise to the challenge.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nEdmund I have sworn my love to both these sisters. Each is\n\nsuspicious of the other, as those who are stung are wary\n\nof the snake. Which of them shall I have? Both? One? Or\n\nneither? Neither can be enjoyed if both remain alive. To take\n\nthe widow would exasperate, infuriate, her sister Goneril.\n\nBut with her husband still alive, I wouldn’t find it easy to\n\nplay a winning game. So for now we’ll use him as a front\n\nman in the battle. When that’s over, it’s up to her who\n\nwants to be rid of him to work out how to see him off. As\n\nfor the mercy he intends to show Lear and Cordelia, once\n\nthe battle’s over and they are at our mercy, they’ll never see\n\nhis pardon. My interests are best served by action rather\n\nthan thought.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nScene 2\n\nA field between the two camps. Noises of war.  Lear  and  Cordelia  cross the stage with some of their army, and leave.  Edgar  enters with  Gloucester .\n\nEdgar Here, father, shelter in the shade of this hospitable\n\ntree. Pray that right triumphs. If ever I return to you again,\n\nI’ll bring you comforting news.\n\nGloucester Grace go with you, sir!\n\n[ Edgar leaves ]\n\n[ The sounds of war grow louder. A retreat is sounded.\n\nEdgar  returns, dismayed ]\n\nEdgar We must go, old man! Give me your hand. [ He tries to\n\npull  Gloucester  to his feet ] Let’s go! King Lear has lost. He\n\nand his daughter have been captured. Give me your hand.\n\nCome on!\n\nGloucester [ resisting ] No further, sir. A man can die well\n\nenough here.\n\nEdgar What, depressed again? Men must endure dying just as\n\nthey do being born. Being prepared for it is what matters.\n\nCome on.\n\nGloucester That’s true, too.\n\n[ He rises to his feet and they leave ]\n\nScene 3\n\nThe British camp near Dover. Drums and flags herald the entrance of  Edmund  in victory, and  Lear  and  Cordelia  in defeat, as prisoners. Soldiers guard them.\n\nEdmund Some officers take them away. Guard them well, till\n\nthe wishes of our leaders, who will decide their fate, are\n\nknown.\n\nCordelia We are not the first to suffer the worst from the best\n\nof intentions. For you – a suffering King – I am defeated: for\n\nmyself I could have faced ill fortune and won. Shall we see\n\nthese “daughters,” these “sisters”?\n\nLear No, no, no, no! Come, let’s be off to prison. We two,\n\nalone, will sing like birds in a cage. When you ask a blessing\n\nof me, I’ll kneel down and ask your forgiveness. That way\n\nwe’ll live, and pray, and sing; and tell each other tales of\n\ndays gone by; and laugh at courtiers in their fancy clothes;\n\nand hear poor wretches discusss the news from court. And\n\nwe’ll talk with them, too: who has failed, and who\n\nsucceeded; who’s in favor, and who’s out; and – as if we\n\nwere God’s spies – solve the mysteries of the universe. In\n\nthe confines of our prison, we’ll outlast many a gang of\n\nhigh and mighty ones, who come and go by the month.\n\nEdmund [ to the Officers ] Take them away.\n\nLear The gods themselves endorse such sacrifices as yours,\n\nCordelia. [ She starts to weep ] Have I made you cry? [ He\n\nputs his arm around her ] To separate us, a man would need\n\na burning torch from heaven – to drive us apart with fire,\n\nlike a fox smoked from its lair. Wipe your eyes. They’ll rot\n\nbefore they’ll make us weep! We’ll see them starved first!\n\nCome!\n\n[ Lear  and  Cordelia  leave under guard ]\n\nEdmund [ to an  Officer ] Come here, Captain. Listen. [ Giving\n\nhim a paper ] Take this note. Follow them to prison. I’ve\n\npromoted you once already. If you follow these instructions,\n\nyou’ll do well for yourself. Know this: men must take\n\nadvantage of their opportunities. To be tender-hearted is not\n\nbecoming in a soldier. This great assignment brooks no\n\nargument: either say you’ll do it, or prosper by some other\n\nmeans.\n\nOfficer I’ll do it, my lord.\n\nEdmund Get on with it then. Consider yourself lucky when\n\nyou’ve done it. Note – I say immediately. Carry it out\n\naccording to my instructions.\n\nOfficer I can’t pull a cart, or live on dried oats like a horse:\n\nso if it’s man’s work, I’ll do it.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\n[ Trumpets sound. Enter  Albany, Goneril, Regan,  Officers\n\nand Soldiers ]\n\nAlbany [ to  Edmund ] Sir, you’ve shown your valiant side\n\ntoday, and fortune has taken care of you. You have the\n\ncaptives who were our enemies in today’s battle: I require\n\nthem from you, to do with them what their deserts, and our\n\nsafety, shall equally determine.\n\nEdmund Sir, I thought it appropriate to send the old and\n\nmiserable King to some confinement, under guard. The\n\nemotional appeal of his age, and even more so his title,\n\ncould win the hearts of the common people, and turn\n\nagainst us the lances of the conscripted soldiers under our\n\ncommand. With him I sent the Queen, for the same reason.\n\nThey are ready tomorrow, or later, to appear wherever you\n\nintend to hold your trial. Right now, we sweat and bleed.\n\nFriend has lost friend. Even the best of causes can be\n\nmisjudged by injured parties acting in the heat of passion.\n\nThe issue of Cordelia and her father requires a more suitable\n\nplace.\n\nAlbany Sir, just a moment. I regard you as a subject in this\n\nwar – not as an equal.\n\nRegan It’s up to us to decide how to rank him. I think our\n\nwishes might have been consulted before you had said so\n\nmuch. He led our armies, and acted with the authority of my\n\nrank and person. Such representation might well stand up\n\nand call itself your equal.\n\nGoneril Not so fast. He ranks higher in his own right than\n\nbecause of any titles you have given him!\n\nRegan In exercising my rights, with my approval, he equates\n\nwith the best.\n\nAlbany That would only be so if he married you.\n\nRegan Many a true word is spoken in jest!\n\nGoneril [ sarcastically ] Well, well, well … That’s seeing\n\nthings straight!\n\nRegan Madam, I am not well: otherwise I’d give you a piece\n\nof my mind. [ To  Edmund ] General, take my soldiers, my\n\nprisoners, my inheritance. Do as you wish with them, and\n\nme. I surrender myself: may the world be witness that I\n\nhereby create you my lord and master.\n\nGoneril Do you intend to marry him?\n\nAlbany [ rebuking his wife sharply ] It’s not for you to say yes\n\nor no!\n\nEdmund Or you, lord –\n\nAlbany Bastard, it is!\n\nRegan [to Edmund ] Let the drum sound and proclaim that\n\nwhat is mine, is yours.\n\nAlbany Hold it: listen to reason! Edmund, I arrest you for\n\ncapital treason; and as your accessory [ he points to\n\nGoneril ], this deceptively beautiful serpent. [ To  Regan ] As\n\nfor your claim, fair sister, I rule it out of order in the interests\n\nof my wife. She’s the one who is under contract to this lord,\n\nand I – her husband – contradict your banns. If you want to\n\nmarry, address your proposals to me. My lady is already\n\nspoken for.\n\nGoneril Such drama!\n\nAlbany You are armed, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound. If\n\nno one appears to prove in combat with you your vile,\n\nundeniable and many treasons, there is my challenge! [ He\n\nthrows down a gauntlet ] I’ll prove it on peril of your life,\n\nbefore ever I break bread again, that you are in every way\n\nwhat I have here described you.\n\nRegan [ holding her forehead ] Sick, oh, I’m sick!\n\nGoneril [ aside ] If not, I’ll never trust poison.\n\nEdmund There’s my response. [ He throws down his own\n\ngauntlet in exchange ] No matter who he is that calls me\n\ntraitor, he lies like a villain! Let the trumpet sound a call.\n\nWhoever dares to come forward, I will defend my truth and\n\nhonor against him, against you, and against anybody.\n\nAlbany [ calling ] A herald, there!\n\nEdmund A herald there, a herald!\n\nAlbany Trust to your personal valor, because your soldiers –\n\nall levied in my name – have accepted their discharge\n\nfrom me.\n\nRegan [ about to fall ] I’m feeling worse.\n\nAlbany She isn’t well. Convey her to my tent. [ Officers\n\nsupport her and lead her out ]\n\n[ A  Herald  enters ]\n\nCome here, herald. Let the trumpet sound, and read this\n\nout. [ He hands over  Edgar’s  challenge ]\n\nOfficer Sound, trumpet! [ A trumpet sounds ]\n\nHerald [ reading ] If any man of rank or distinction, presently\n\nenlisted in the army, will maintain that Edmund, supposed\n\nEarl of Gloucester, is an all-around traitor, let him appear by\n\nthe third sound of the trumpet. He will defend himself\n\nboldly.\n\nSound!\n\n[ The trumpet sounds for the first time ]\n\nAgain!\n\n[ The second trumpet sounds ]\n\nAgain!\n\n[ The third trumpet sounds. There is a pause, and then an\n\nanswering trumpet is heard from nearby.  Edgar  enters,\n\narmed, preceded by a trumpeter ]\n\nAlbany [ to the  Herald ] Ask him what is his purpose in\n\nappearing upon the trumpet call.\n\nHerald Who are you? Your name? Your rank? Why do you\n\nrespond to this summons?\n\nEdgar Know that my name is not on record. Treason has\n\ndestroyed it. Yet I am as noble as the adversary I come to\n\nfight.\n\nAlbany Who is that adversary?\n\nEdgar Who represents Edmund, Earl of Gloucester?\n\nEdmund [ stepping forward ] He himself. What have you to say\n\nto him?\n\nEdgar Draw your sword, so that, if what I have to say offends\n\na noble heart, your valor may bring you justice. Here is\n\nmine. [ He draws his sword from its scabbard ] Behold! To\n\ndraw it is the privilege of my rank, my vows, and my knight-\n\nhood. I declare – notwithstanding your strength, position,\n\nyouth, and eminence, despite your victorious sword, your\n\nbrand-new good fortune, your valor and your\n\ncourage – that you are a traitor! You have betrayed your\n\ngods, your brother and your father. You have conspired\n\nagainst this illustrious high-born prince, and from the top of\n\nyour head to the dust below your feet, you are a most\n\ninfamous traitor! Deny it, and this sword, this arm, and my\n\nbest endeavors are determined to prove to that heart of\n\nyours, to which I speak, that you lie!\n\nEdmund Common sense tells me I should ask your name. But\n\nas your exterior looks so good and valiant, and because your\n\nspeech has a touch of good breeding about it, though I\n\ncould with all propriety postpone this combat – according to\n\nthe rules of knighthood – this I disdainfully refuse to do. I\n\nthrow these accusations of treason back at you, together\n\nwith the hateful-as-hell charge of lying. Though right now\n\nthey pass you by unscathed, my sword will thrust them\n\nhome where they belong, and put them to rest forever.\n\nTrumpets, speak!\n\n[ Edmund  and  Edgar  fight.  Edmund  falls, wounded ]\n\nAlbany Save him! Save him!\n\nGoneril This is trickery, Gloucester. By the code of arms, you\n\nwere not obliged to fight with an unknown enemy. You are\n\nnot defeated, but cheated and deceived!\n\nAlbany Shut your mouth, woman, or I’ll stop it with this\n\nletter. [ It is  Goneril’s  to  Edmund,  the one which  Edgar  found\n\non  Oswald  in Act 4 Scene 6. To  Edgar ] Hold your sword, sir.\n\n[ To  Goneril ] Wicked beyond all words: read your own evil!\n\n[ Goneril  tries to grab the paper ] No snatching, lady! I\n\nsuspect you know what it is.\n\nGoneril What if I do? The law belongs to me, not you. Who\n\ncould prosecute me for it?\n\nAlbany How utterly monstrous! Oh! Do you know this letter?\n\nGoneril [ hysterical now ] Don’t ask me what I know!\n\n[ She leaves, distraught ]\n\nAlbany Follow her. She’s desperate. Take charge of her.\n\n[ An Officer leaves ]\n\nEdmund [ to  Albany ] What you have charged me with, I have\n\ndone: and more, much more. Time will reveal all. It’s over\n\nnow, and so am I. [ To  Edgar ] But who are you, who has the\n\nadvantage over me? If you are noble, I forgive you.\n\nEdgar Let’s exchange courtesies. I am no less noble than you\n\nare, Edmund. If I’m more, you have wronged me all the\n\nmore. My name is Edgar, and I’m your father’s son. The\n\ngods are just. They use the vices we take pleasure in as the\n\nmeans to punish us; conceiving you cost him his eyes.\n\nEdmund You’ve said right. It’s true. The wheel of fortune has\n\nturned a full circle. I am back at the bottom.\n\nAlbany [ to  Edgar ] I thought your very walk suggested a royal\n\nnobleness. My welcome to you. [ They embrace in soldierly\n\nfashion ] May sorrow be my lot if ever I hated you or your\n\nfather.\n\nEdgar Wise prince, I know that.\n\nAlbany Where did you hide yourself? How did you know\n\nabout your father’s sufferings?\n\nEdgar By nursing them, my lord. Listen to a brief story, and\n\nwhen I’ve told it, would that my heart would burst! To\n\nescape the threat of death that was so close upon me – oh,\n\nhow sweet life is, in that we suffer the pain of death by the\n\nhour rather than die suddenly! – I learned to dress in the\n\nrags of a madman, and to assume a character that even\n\ndogs despised. And in this clothing I met my father with his\n\nbleeding sockets, his eyes newly blinded. I became his\n\nguide, led him, begged for him, and saved him from despair.\n\nI never, foolishly, revealed myself to him till some\n\nhalf hour ago, when I was in armor. Not certain of this\n\nfortunate outcome, though hoping for it, I asked his\n\nblessing, and told him of my journeying from first to last. But\n\nhis injured heart, alas, too weak to carry the strain, torn\n\nbetween the two extremes of passion – joy and\n\ngrief – burst with happiness.\n\nEdmund This speech of yours has touched me, and it could\n\nperhaps do some good. Proceed. You look as though you\n\nhave more to say.\n\nAlbany [ to  Edgar ] If there’s more to report that’s more\n\nharrowing, keep it to yourself. I’m almost at the point of\n\ntears, hearing of this.\n\nEdgar Those who cannot cope with sorrow would think of\n\nthis as a breaking-point. To add more woe by giving details\n\nwould generate further suffering, and go beyond all bearing.\n\nWhile I was bawling out my grief, a man arrived who, having\n\nseen me in my wretchedness, would have avoided my\n\nloathsome company. But seeing who it was that suffered\n\nso, he wrapped his strong arms around my neck, and\n\nbellowed out as if he’d burst the heavens. He embraced my\n\nfather, and told the most pitiful tale about Lear and himself\n\nthat ever anyone heard. In the telling of it, his grief\n\noverwhelmed him, and his hold on life began to slip. Then\n\nthe trumpet sounded twice; and there I left him,\n\nunconscious.\n\nAlbany But who was this?\n\nEdgar Kent, sir, the banished Kent, who in disguise followed\n\nthe King from whom he was alienated, serving him beyond\n\nthe duties even of a slave.\n\n[ A  Gentleman  enters, carrying a bloodstained knife ]\n\nGentleman Help, help, oh, help!\n\nEdgar What kind of help?\n\n[ The  Gentleman  is too choked to answer ]\n\nAlbany Speak up, man!\n\nEdgar Why this bloodstained knife?\n\nGentleman It’s warm … it’s steaming … it came from the\n\nheart of … [ He cannot find the words ] Oh, she’s dead!\n\nAlbany Who is dead? Speak, man!\n\nGentleman Your wife, sir, your wife. And she has poisoned\n\nyour sister-in-law. She confessed it.\n\nEdmund I was engaged to them both. All three of us will now\n\nbe married at the same time.\n\nEdgar Here comes Kent.\n\n[ Kent  enters ]\n\nAlbany Bring in the bodies, alive or dead.\n\n[ A  Gentleman  leaves ]\n\nThis judgment of heaven, fearful though it is, does not\n\narouse our pity. [ To  Kent ] Oh, is this the man? This is not\n\nthe right time for the normal courtesies.\n\nKent I have come to bid my King and master an everlasting\n\ngood night. Is he not here?\n\nAlbany A serious oversight! Speak, Edmund! Where is the\n\nKing? And where is Cordelia? [ The bodies of  Goneril  and\n\nRegan  are brought in ] Do you see this, Kent?\n\nKent Alas: what’s caused this?\n\nEdmund So Edmund was indeed loved! One poisoned the\n\nother for my sake, and afterwards killed herself.\n\nAlbany Indeed so. Cover their faces.\n\nEdmund I pant for life. I mean to do some good, in spite of my\n\nnature. Send quickly – hurry now! – to the castle. I’ve given\n\norders for the deaths of Lear and Cordelia. Get there in time.\n\nAlbany Run – run! Oh, run!\n\nEdgar To whom, my lord? Who is in charge? Send your token,\n\nindicating a reprieve.\n\nEdmund A good idea: take my sword. Give it to the captain.\n\nEdgar [ passing the sword to an Officer ] Hurry, on your life!\n\n[ The Officer runs off ]\n\nEdmund [ to  Albany ] He has orders from your wife and me to\n\nhang Cordelia in the prison, and to say her despair led to her\n\nsuicide.\n\nAlbany The gods protect her! [ To Servants ] Take him away\n\nfor the moment. [ Edmund  is carried off ]\n\n[ Lear  enters, with  Cordelia  dead in his arms ]\n\nLear Howl, howl, howl! Oh, you are men of stone! If I\n\nhad your tongues and eyes, I’d use them so the roof of\n\nheaven would crack! She’s gone forever. I know when one\n\nis dead, and when one lives. She’s as dead as earth. Lend\n\nme a mirror. If her breath will mist or stain the glass, why,\n\nthen she lives!\n\nKent Is this the end of the world?\n\nEdgar Or a copy of that horror?\n\nAlbany May the heavens fall, and all things cease!\n\nLear [ testing to see whether  Cordelia  is breathing ] This\n\nfeather moves! She’s alive! If so, it is a piece of luck that\n\ncancels out all the sorrows that I have ever felt.\n\nKent [ kneeling ] Oh, my good master!\n\nLear [ pushing him aside anxiously ] Go away!\n\nEdgar [ explaining ] It’s the noble Kent, your friend.\n\nLear Damn you! Murderers, traitors, all of you! I might have\n\nsaved her. Now she’s gone forever. Cordelia, Cordelia, stay\n\na while! [ He puts his ear to her lips ] What’s that you say?\n\nHer voice was always soft, gentle and low: an excellent\n\nthing in a woman. [ Proudly ] I killed the wretch who was\n\nhanging you!\n\nOfficer It’s true, my lords: he did.\n\nLear Didn’t I, man? I’ve seen the day when, with my good\n\nsharp sword I would have made them jump! I am old now,\n\nand these ailments of mine get in the way. [ He peers at\n\nKent ] Who are you? My eyes are not as good as they might\n\nbe; I’ll tell you straight –\n\nKent If Fortune should boast of two men she both loved and\n\nhated, we are looking at one of them now.\n\nLear – my sight is poor. [ After a pause ] Aren’t you Kent?\n\nKent I am. Your servant, Kent. Where is your servant called\n\nCaius?\n\nLear [ recognizing the name  Kent  used when disguised ] He’s a\n\ngood fellow, I can tell you that! He’ll fight, and quickly, too!\n\n[ Sadly ] He’s dead and decayed.\n\nKent No, my good lord. I am the man –\n\nLear [ not able to grasp what  Kent  says ] I’ll see to that in a\n\nmoment.\n\nKent – who has followed in your sad steps from the very\n\nbeginning of your declining fortunes.\n\nLear You are welcome here.\n\nKent The very man. All is dreary, dark, and funereal. Your\n\neldest daughters have put an end to themselves, and in\n\nhopeless desperation are dead.\n\nLear [ uncomprehending ] Yes, so I believe.\n\nAlbany He doesn’t know what he is saying. It’s no use our\n\ntalking to him.\n\nEdgar None whatever.\n\n[ An  Officer  enters ]\n\nOfficer Edmund is dead, my lord.\n\nAlbany That’s of small importance here. Lords and noble\n\nfriends, know our intentions. We shall provide what comfort\n\nwe can for this noble ruin of mankind. As for us, we shall\n\nabdicate our absolute power to this old majesty during the\n\nremainder of his life. [ To  Edgar  and  Kent ] As for you: resume\n\nyour rightful places, with such additional titles as your noble\n\ndeeds have more than earned. All friends shall be rewarded\n\nfor their loyalty, and all foes punished as they deserve to be.\n\nOh, look, look!\n\nLear And my poor child is hanged! No, no, no life! Why should\n\na dog, or a horse, or a rat have life, and you no breath at all?\n\nYou’ll come no more: never, never, never, never, never! [ He\n\nstruggles with his collar ] Please, undo this button. [ Albany\n\nhelps him ] Thank you, sir. [ He imagines  Cordelia  is showing\n\nsigns of life ] Do you see this? Look at her – look – her lips!\n\nLook there, look there! [ The excitement overwhelms him,\n\nand he dies ]\n\nEdgar He’s fainted! [ Shaking  Lear ] My lord, my lord!\n\nKent May he suffer no more!\n\nEdgar Come on, my lord!\n\nKent [ drawing him away ] Don’t trouble his parting soul. Let\n\nhim go. Only an enemy would prolong the torture.\n\nEdgar He’s really gone.\n\nKent The surprising thing is that he endured his suffering\n\nso long. He lived on borrowed time.\n\nAlbany Bear them away. General mourning is now our\n\nimmediate concern. [ To  Kent  and  Edgar ] Kindred souls: you\n\ntwo shall rule in this kingdom, to shoulder the burden of our\n\nruined state.\n\nKent [ hinting at his death ] I have a journey to make, sir, soon.\n\nMy master calls me. I must not deny him.\n\nEdgar We must respond to the burdens of these sad times,\n\nand speak frankly, not expediently. The oldest have suffered\n\nmost. We who are young will never see as much as they\n\nhave seen, or live so long.\n\n[ The bodies are all taken up, and everyone leaves\n\nat a dead march ]\n\nActivities\n\nCharacters\n\nSearch the text (either the original or the modern version) to find answers to the following questions.

Give examples.\n\nb What has he done which is reminiscent of Lear in his prime?\n\nc Why is the moment of his death an apt one?\n\nGoneril and Regan\n\n1 Their public speeches near the beginning of Act I Scene 1 contrast sharply with their private ones at the end.\n\na Goneril appears to take flattery as far as it will go in expressing her love for her father.\n\ni How does Regan succeed in topping her?\n\nii At this point, is there any recognizable difference in the characters of the two sisters?\n\nb What evidence is there\n\ni that they have been keeping a critical eye on their father?\n\nii that they do not respect him?\n\niii that they do not appreciate what he has given them?\n\nc From the evidence in this dialogue, and especially the last two lines of the scene, decide which sister is the dominant one.\n\n2 It is to his eldest daughter Goneril that Lear first goes after resigning the throne.\n\na Read Act I Scene 3 , and list\n\ni Lear’s alleged offenses;\n\nii Goneril’s plans for dealing with him.\n\nb What do you deduce about her character?\n\n3 a Goneril challenges Lear in Act I Scene 4 .\n\ni Compare her accusations with those in Act I Scene 3 . Have they changed?\n\nii What is consistent about her manner toward her father?\n\nb She also stands up to her husband, Albany. How is it made clear that she is the dominant partner?\n\n4 In Act IV Scene 1 Regan and her husband visit Gloucester.\n\na How does Regan’s relationship with Cornwall differ from her sister’s with Albany?\n\nb How can we tell that Regan has a prejudiced and distorted attitude toward her father and his knights?\n\nc At this point in the play, how would you describe Regan’s attitude toward Gloucester?\n\n5 a Find evidence in Act II Scene 2 and Act II Scene 4 to confirm Regan’s assertion in Act I Scene 1 : “I am made of that self metal as my sister.”\n\nb i How do the two sisters act in concert in Act II Scene 4 ?\n\nii Which sister seems, on balance, to be the more obsessed with the danger of Lear’s followers?\n\n6 a Both sisters take a life during the course of the play.\n\ni Compare the circumstances and contrast the methods employed by each.\n\nii Is Goneril’s suicide consistent with her character?\n\nb Both sisters fall in love with Edmund.\n\ni Deduce from this the qualities they both admire in a man.\n\nii Examine Goneril’s attitude to her husband in Act I Scene 4 , Act IV Scene 1 , and Act V Scene 3 . What qualities in a man does she despise?\n\nc The two sisters are “jealous of the other, as the stung are of the adder” (Edmund, Act V Scene 1 ).\n\ni Check the meaning of these words in the modern translation, then trace the course of the “jealousy” in Act IV Scene 2 , Act IV Scene 5 , Act V Scene 1 and Act V Scene 3 .\n\nii Both Goneril and Regan are demonstrably bad daughters and bad sisters. One plans to have her husband murdered (check Act IV Scene 2 and Act IV Scene 6 ); the other has a sadistic trait (check Act II Scene 2 and Act III Scene 7 ). Is either less pernicious than the other?\n\nCordelia\n\n1 That Cordelia was Lear’s favorite daughter is confirmed three times in Act I Scene 1 : find the relevant evidence in speeches by\n(a) Goneril; (b) the King of France; (c) Lear himself.\n\n2 That Cordelia is Lear’s most virtuous and loving daughter is confirmed\n\na in Act IV Scene 3 . How does Cordelia’s reported response to the news of Lear’s maltreatment show both her feelings, and her natural disinclination to reveal them in public?\n\nb in Act IV Scene 4 . How does Cordelia show her love both emotionally and practically?\n\nc in Act IV Scene 7 . What examples are there of her (i) goodness (ii) kindness (iii) compassion (iv) tenderness (v) forgiving nature?\n\n3 That Cordelia is loved and respected by others is demonstrated in Act I Scenes 1 and 4\n\na by Kent. How does he compliment her?\n\nb by the King of France. What value does he put upon her?\n\nc by the Fool. What effect does Cordelia’s departure have on him?\n\n4 a Twice in Act I Scene 1 Cordelia refers to her natural reticence. Find the lines, and\n\nb check them against Lear’s description of her speaking voice in Act V Scene 3 . Then\n\nc comment on the aptness of the King of France’s analysis of her character in Act I Scene 1 .\n\n5 In spite of saying so little, and appearing only four times in the play, Cordelia shows she has several very positive characteristics.\n\na She is honest. What is the best example of this?\n\nb She deplores insincerity. How does she make this plain (i) to the Duke of Burgundy? (ii) to her sisters?\n\nc She respects integrity. How do we know she recognizes the goodness of Kent?\n\nd She is loyal. Where does Lear say she has good reason not to be?\n\ne She is philosophical. How is this demonstrated by her last speech in the play?\n\nKent\n\n1 Kent has the first words in the play, and almost the last. In Act I Scene 1 , he is fearlessly outspoken; from his speeches choose\n\na three words or phrases which confirm his loyalty to the King;\n\nb three words or phrases which show his clear understanding of Lear’s wrongheadedness;\n\nc three words or phrases which indicate his understanding of Goneril and Regan.\n\n2 a Outspokenness is also a major characteristic of Kent in disguise. How does this work\n\ni to his advantage in Act I Scene 4 and\n\nii to his disadvantage in Act II Scene 2 ?\n\nb In the latter scene, Cornwall speaks of Kent’s “saucy roughness.” Find examples of this in\n\ni his argument with Oswald;\n\nii his retorts to Cornwall and Regan.\n\n3 Between Act III Scene 1 and Act V Scene 3 , Kent’s role is one of protector and correspondent, working on behalf of Lear’s cause.\n\na In the storm scene ( Act III Scene 6 ) he stands out as being the only rational man at the trial. His suggested cure for Lear’s insanity is the same as the Doctor’s in Act IV Scene 4: what is it?\n\nb In Act III Scene 1 and Act IV Scene 3 , Kent establishes links with Cordelia and the French invading army at Dover. What is said at the beginning of Act IV Scene 3 and the end of Act IV Scene 4 to clear Kent of the charge of treason?\n\n4 What is the evidence in Act V Scene 3 that Kent sees his service to the King as extending beyond the grave?\n\nThe Fool\n\n1 a The Fool first appears in Act I Scene 4 .\n\ni How many times does Lear have to call for him before he appears?\n\nii What is the Knight’s explanation for the Fool’s absence, and what does it tell us about the latter’s feelings?\n\nb Immediately, the Fool begins to jest about foolishness\n\ni to Kent (and again in Act II Scene 4 ). Explain why.\n\nii to Lear. What does he say that merits Kent’s remark: “This is not altogether fool, my lord”?\n\nc Collect further examples of the Fool’s oft-reiterated theme, in this scene and the others in which he appears.\n\n2 a Another of his targets is Truth (and its counterpart, Falsehood). How many references to it can you find in Act I Scene 4 ?\n\nb Find examples of Truth conveyed by means of\n\ni jokes and conundrums;\n\nii songs;\n\niii wise sayings.\n\nc In the circumstances, why does Goneril say he is “more knave than fool”?\n\n3 The Fool’s second appearance, in Act I Scene 5 , follows Lear’s humiliation at the hands of Goneril.\n\na Why do you think the Fool’s first joke is about brains?\n\nb What message is he trying to convey in his jokes about crab-apples, noses, and snails?\n\nc Which of the Fool’s remarks is close to the unvarnished truth?\n\nd Mark the text at points where the Fool diverts Lear from brooding about his troubles.\n\n4 a As Lear becomes more isolated and tormented, the Fool works harder to sustain him, maintaining his pointed jokes, puns and witticisms as the King progresses toward madness. In Act II Scene 4\n\ni How many jokes does he make at Lear’s expense?\n\nii How many at Kent’s?\n\niii Is there a significance in the switch of emphasis?\n\nb As Lear departs into the storm, the Fool is his only companion. According to the Gentleman in Act III Scene 1 , what is his function now?\n\n5 The storm scenes ( Act III Scenes 2 ; 4 ; 6 ) are those in which Lear’s “wits begin to turn” and he goes mad.\n\na The Fool suffers from the same physical discomfort as his master. Which lines in Act III Scene 2 show that they have come close together through hardship?\n\nb What incident in Act III Scene 4 is close enough to farce to relieve the dramatic tension?\n\nc Which line spoken by the Fool in Edgar’s presence emphasizes the leveling effect of their situation?\n\nd How does the Fool’s presence at the mock trial of Goneril and Regan help to bring out the full pathos and tragedy of Lear’s condition?\n\n6 The Fool’s last words in the play (“And I’ll go to bed at noon”) can be interpreted many ways. Here are two of them:\n\na “If you are having your evening meal in the morning, then my bedtime will be noon” (i.e., a straightforward quip).\n\nb “I shall not live much longer” (i.e., using the word “bed” as a euphemism for “grave”).\n\nThose who favor (a) point out that the Fool’s dramatic usefulness is at an end, so Shakespeare gives him no more lines to say. Those who favor (b) say Lear’s “And my poor fool is hanged” ( Act V Scene 3 ) proves that he committed suicide, though the word “fool” could mean “child” and therefore refer to Cordelia.\n\nWhat is your opinion?\n\nGloucester\n\n1 Gloucester opens the play by making light of a “pleasant vice” which resulted in the birth of the illegitimate Edmund. Look up Edgar’s words to the dying Edmund in Act V Scene 3 : show how they confirm the former’s belief that “the gods are just” in dealing with immorality.\n\n2 Edmund describes Gloucester as “a credulous father.” Trace the tricks Edmund uses to deceive Gloucester in Act I Scene 1 and Act II Scene 2 .\n\na Is his success due entirely to his manipulative skills, or have recent events made the old Earl vulnerable?\n\nb Show that Gloucester’s mind is in a state of turmoil after Lear’s abdication.\n\n3 Gloucester seems weak, letting others make decisions for him.\n\na To Edmund, he says “frame the business after your own wisdom” in Act I Scene 2 ; and he refers to Cornwall as “The noble Duke my master” in Act II Scene 1 . What is ironic about his dependence on these two men?\n\nb Consider his protest at the stocking of Kent. Do you think he did all he could in the circumstances?\n\nc Read the dialogue between Lear and Gloucester in Act II Scene 4 concerning Cornwall’s slighting of the King. Does Gloucester’s exit line imply that he lacks the courage to take sides?\n\n4 By Act III Scene 2 Gloucester has had further experience of Goneril and Regan, and time to think.\n\na Explain what is praiseworthy about his resolution.\n\nb Explain what is unfortunate about his choice of confidant.\n\nc Explain how he puts his decision to aid Lear into practice.\n\n5 In Act III Scene 7 Gloucester suffers cruelly for his loyalty.\n\na Illustrate\n\ni his dignity while being threatened;\n\nii his strong moral values.\n\nb Later, in Act IV Scene 1 , he says “I stumbled when I saw.” What is the first truth he learns after losing his sight?\n\n6 Blindness brings despair to Gloucester.\n\na In Act IV Scene 1 , which lines sum up his pessimistic philosophy?\n\nb What is his purpose in seeking to be guided toward Dover?\n\n7 Act IV Scene 6 sees Gloucester, led by Edgar, “at the top of that same hill” which, he is told, overlooks the sea.\n\na Explain why it is necessary for Edgar to mislead his father.\n\nb Choose two statements by Gloucester, one after Edgar’s successful ruse, and one after his meeting with Lear, to show that he has rejected the pessimism of Act IV Scene 1 .\n\nc i On what occasion in Act V Scene 2 does Gloucester relapse into melancholy?\n\nii What observation revives him?\n\n8 Gloucester’s death is reported by Edgar in Act V Scene 3 . What was the cause of it?\n\nEdmund\n\n1 We meet Edmund at the very beginning of the play, when Gloucester speaks for him, and we learn of his illegitimacy. Find two reasons why\n\na he might be forgiven for having a jaundiced view of society;\n\nb he might be forgiven for his subsequent lack of filial loyalty.\n\n2 In his soliloquy in Act I Scene 2 , lines 1–22 Edmund speaks for himself.\n\na To whose “law” does he say his “services are bound”?\n\nb List his arguments for appealing to the gods to “stand up for bastards.”\n\n3 a Edmund’s villainy has a strong element of wit about it. Find examples in Act I Scene 2 , with reference to\n\ni his deception of Gloucester and manipulation of Edgar;\n\nii his skeptical references to astrology;\n\niii his use of irony.\n\nb Which lines summarize his case for intrigue against “a credulous father and a brother noble”?\n\nc In Act II Scene 1 ,\n\ni how many examples of his cunning trickery can you find?\n\nii which of Gloucester’s lines indicate that Edmund has succeeded?\n\niii which lines of Cornwall’s advance his prospects even further?\n\n4 In Act III Scene 5 , Edmund tells Cornwall: “I will perserver in my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore between that and my blood.”\n\na Consider\n\ni what he has previously said in Act III Scene 3 ;\n\nii his behavior in Act III Scene 7 ;\n\niii Regan’s report of his murderous intentions in Act IV Scene 5 .\n\nb Is there any evidence of conflicting loyalty?\n\n5 Both Goneril and Regan fall in love with Edmund.\n\na Find the evidence in Act IV Scene 2 , Act IV Scene 5 , and Act V Scene 1 .\n\nb Decide from Edmund’s soliloquy at the end of Act V Scene 1 how far their love is reciprocated.\n\n6 By the end of the play, Edmund has been both victor and vanquished.\n\na In victory, what is his most wicked deed?\n\nb In defeat, what good does he do “despite of mine own nature”?\n\nc Do the words he utters in his dying moments – “Yet Edmund was beloved” – provide any clue about either his past behavior or his deathbed reformation?\n\nEdgar\n\n1 Edgar plays a number of roles throughout the play.\n\na In Act I Scene 1 he is simply the Earl of Gloucester’s legitimate son. How much older is he than Edmund?\n\nb In Act I Scene 2 he is in disgrace. How does Edmund account for the ease with which this was accomplished?\n\nc By Act II Scene 3 he is Poor Tom: “Edgar I nothing am.”\n\ni Describe his appearance.\n\nii Using the information in Act III Scene 4 , list his sufferings and show why “unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal” as he is.\n\niii Explain why Lear finds him a congenial companion, and how Lear’s suffering helps Edgar endure his own.\n\niv Show from Edgar’s words in Act IV Scene 1 that he has the courage and the philosophy to overcome despair.\n\n2 a Edgar is changed for the better when he appears in Act IV Scene 6 , although he denies this to his blind father.\n\ni From whom did he obtain his superior clothes?\n\nii In what ways is his speech different?\n\nb i What is Edgar’s purpose in “trifling thus with his [i.e., Gloucester’s] despair”?\n\nii Explain his method of procedure.\n\nc Which lines of Gloucester’s prove that the ruse has worked?\n\n3 a In his final role in the play, Edgar is a man of action.\n\ni What is his first valorous deed on behalf of his father in Act IV Scene 6 ?\n\nii What is the second, before the battle, in Act V Scene 1 ?\n\niii What is the third, after the battle?\n\nb i Show from the speeches of Edmund and Albany at the end of the play that Edgar has royal dignity.\n\nii In the Quarto edition of the play (1608), the last lines of King Lear are given to Albany. Do you agree with the Folio editors that the words are more appropriately given to Edgar?\n\nStructure, themes and imagery\n\n1 The play has both a main plot and a subplot. Identify the main characters in each.\n\n2 Show how in each there is\n \n3 Complete the following:\n \n4 The theme that initiates events in the play is that of the generation gap; the relationship of parent and child, and the duties and obligations that flow from the blood-bond. Find examples of parent/child relationships involving\n\n(a) gratitude/ingratitude (b) kindness/cruelty (c) trust/deceit (d) legitimacy/illegitimacy (e) duties/freedoms (f) respect/contempt (g) hatred/love\n\n5 Self-knowledge, and the pursuit of truth, go hand-in-hand with the development of the plot.\n\na Lear goes mad before he comes to his senses. Find examples of his progress from folly to wisdom in the following scenes:\n\n(i) Act I Scene 1 (ii) Act I Scene 4 (iii) Act 2 Scene 4 (iv) Act 3 Scenes 2  and  6 (v) Act 4 Scenes 6  and  7\n\nb Gloucester loses his sight before he can “see.” Trace the stages through which he passes (noting in particular how he learns to accept Edgar’s dictum “Ripeness is all”) in the following scenes:\n\n(i) Act I Scenes 1  and  2 (ii) Act 2 Scene 1 (iii) Act 3 Scenes 3  and  4 (iv) Act 3 Scene 7 (v) Act 4 Scene 1 (vi) Act 4 Scene 6 (vii) Act 5 Scene 2 .\n\n6 a The largest theme of all is that of the nature of man, in terms both of the individual and of the way he behaves (often hypocritically) in organized society. The following speeches are central; they are all spoken by Lear:\n\ni “Reason not the need …” ( Act 2 Scene 4 ). What is “the need”?\n\nii “Let the great gods … find out their enemies now” ( Act 3 Scene 2 ). Who are their enemies?\n\niii “Poor naked wretches …” ( Act 3 Scene 4 ). What is to be learned from them?\n\niv “What, art mad? … harder, harder; so.” ( Act 4 Scene 6 ) What has Lear learned about power, corruption, and the dispensation of justice?\n\nb How many relevant pieces of wisdom can you find among the songs and sayings of the Fool?\n\n7 Animal imagery abounds in King Lear. To convey the inhumanity of human behavior and its similarity to wild life, over sixty different creatures are mentioned.

Place the following examples in context and explain the force of the imagery:\n\ni “These hot tears which break from me perforce …” ( Act 1 )\n\nii “Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain …” ( Act 2 )\n\niii “Crack Nature’s moulds …” ( Act 3 )\n\niv “She that herself will silver and disbranch from her material sap …” ( Act 4 )\n\nv “The strings of life begin to crack …” ( Act 5 )\n\n9 Imagery based on physical suffering is recurrent in King Lear. The torment endured by Lear and Gloucester, and the savagery of the play as a whole, are reflected in terms of “a human body in anguished movement: tugged, wrenched, beaten, pierced, stung, scourged, dislocated, flayed, gashed, scalded, tortured and finally broken on the rack” (Caroline Spurgeon: Shakespeare’s Imagery).\n\na Trace the following examples to their contexts, and explain their appositeness. They are all from Act One .\n\ni … “wrenched my frame of nature from the fixed place”\n\nii … “Th’untented woundings of a father’s curse Pierce every sense about thee!”\n\niii … “with her nails she’ll flay thy wolvish visage”\n\nb Find further examples, guided by Miss Spurgeon’s list.\n\n10 In his opening address to the court in Act I Scene 1 , Lear says he will “divest” himself of “rule, Interest of territory, cares of state.” Imagery based on clothing (or references to it) can be found throughout the play.\n\na Find examples from speeches by the following:\n\ni France, in Act I Scene 1 ;\n\nii Cornwall, in Act 2 Scene 2 ;\n\niii Lear, in Act 3 Scene 4 ;\n\niv Lear in Act 3 Scene 6 .\n\nb Explain why clothes have a symbolic significance in relation to the play’s major themes.\n\nTextual questions\n\nRead the original Shakespeare and (if necessary) the modern transcription, to gain an understanding of the speeches and extracts below. Then concentrate entirely on the original in answering the questions.\n\n1 Thou, Nature, art my goddess ( Act I Scene 2 )\n\na Edmund has said very little up to this point, and what he has said would accord with customs in polite society. What is the element of shock built into these first words of his soliloquy?\n\nb A soliloquy can either be regarded as “thinking aloud, alone” or “confiding inner thoughts to a wider audience.” If you were playing the part of Edmund, would you treat these lines as private musing, or as an opportunity to address the audience?\n\nc Why is custom said to be “a plague”?\n\nd Why is “moonshines Lag of a brother” more wittily suggestive than “younger than a brother”?\n\ne Edmund repeats “base” five times, “bastard” three times, and “bastardy” and “baseness” once each, all in the space of twenty-two lines. What effect does this have on what in former times would have been a series of words with derogatory connotations?\n\nf What effect on the meaning of “legitimate” does Edmund’s\n\n(i) reference to conception in and out of wedlock and\n\n(ii) repetition of the word as adjective and noun five times have on its normally favorable meaning?\n\ng Why might an audience at this stage in the play’s development side with a character who has announced his villainous intentions?\n\n2 These late eclipses in the sun and moon ( Act I Scene 2 )\n\na Gloucester believes there is an astrological explanation for the troubles of his time. What is Edmund’s viewpoint on the subject?\n\nb “Nature” is a word frequently used throughout the play; here it means “man’s reason.” Collect as many references to nature as you can find, and interpret each one according to the context in which it appears.\n\nc Several items in Gloucester’s catalogue of woe are directly related to the circumstances of the play. Explain each.\n\nd Gloucester uses the word “nothing.” So do Lear and Cordelia in Act I Scene 1 . (i) How many times can you find the word employed in King Lear and (ii) can you explain why it should be so significant a word?\n\n3 I heard myself proclaimed ( Act 2 Scene 3 )\n\na Why “happy” hollow?\n\nb Edgar uses mostly words of one or two syllables in this soliloquy. (i) How does this help to emphasize important information and (ii) how does this help to emphasize the words which are exceptions to the rule?\n\nc Edgar is planning to be “Poor Tom” here. Compare what is said of him, and by him, in Act 3 Scene 4 . Does he carry out his plans to the letter?\n\nd The play is set in ancient Britain: what evidence is there here that Elizabethan audiences did not object to anachronisms?\n\ne Reread Act I Scene 2 : what is ironic about Edgar’s choice of name for his new identity?\n\n4 I prithee, daughter , do not make me mad ( Act 2 Scene 4 )\n\na In this speech, Lear says “I can be patient.” “Patient” and “patience” are words with many echoes throughout the play. Find as many as you can.\n\nb Here patience is shown in the way Lear’s outbursts are followed by checks. Mark the text (i) where you believe Lear raises his voice in anger, and (ii) where he disciplines himself with self-control.\n\nc (i) Some lines are effective here because they are antithetical: that is, one half of the line is balanced against the other. Find examples, and say how they add to the pathos of Lear’s words.\n\n(ii) Sometimes Lear’s mounting anger results in repetition in sets of three words or phrases. Find two examples.\n\nd How does Lear make his critical points perfectly clear while affecting not to?\n\n5 O, reason not the need ( Act 2 Scene 4 )\n\na The first lines relate significantly to the process whereby Lear’s folly is redeemed. Explain why.\n\nb Lear only once refers to “God” in his speeches. Here, as elsewhere, he addresses “heavens” and “you gods.” Sometimes in the play the gods are regarded as malevolent (find Gloucester’s anguished cry in Act 4 Scene 1 ) and sometimes benign (note his retraction in Act 4 Scene 6 ). What position does Lear take here?\n\nc How is Lear’s pathetic impotence conveyed (i) in disjointed sentences and (ii) by a short line?\n\nd If you were producing the play, would you have Lear leave the stage in tears, or not? Discuss the alternatives and give reasons for your decision.\n\n6 Blow , winds , and crack your cheeks! ( Act 3 Scene 2 )\n\na The Elizabethan theater had primitive sound effects, and performances took place on fine days in the open air. How does Shakespeare\n\ni create the illusion of a storm by means of words?\n\nii succeed in conveying a sense of Lear’s impending mental breakdown?\n\nb The passionate force of Lear’s raging is conveyed by the verbs he uses to command the elements.\n\ni List them, and\n\nii show how water, fire, explosion and destruction are called upon to carry out his orders.\n\nc In this speech, some lines are composed of multisyllabic and/or hyphenated words; others are mainly monosyllabic.\n\ni List them, and\n\nii show how water, fire, explosion and destruction are called upon to carry out his orders.\n\n7 Examine the following key speeches in similar detail:\n\na Poor naked wretches, whereso’er you are ( Act 3 Scene 4 )\n\nb Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile ( Act 4 Scene 2 )\n\nc Come on, sir, here’s the place: stand still ( Act 4 Scene 6 )\n\nd Ay, every inch a king ( Act 4 Scene 6 )\n\ne And the creature run from the cur ( Act 4 Scene 6 )\n\nf Pray do not mock me ( Act 4 Scene 7 )\n\ng No, no, no, no! Come, let’s away to prison ( Act 5 Scene 3 )\n\nh Lear’s last speeches, from Howl, howl, howl to Look there, look there! ( Act 5 Scene 3 )\n\nExamination questions\n\n1 King Lear is a play based on family relationships.

Widely considered one of Shakespeare’s greatest tragedies, King Lear tells the story of a king who goes mad after bequeathing his fortune and power to his daughters. It is loosely based on the myth of Leir of Britain, a legendary monarch said to have ruled Ancient Britons in the eighth century B.C.\nThis guide refers to the 1999 Pelican Shakespeare edition. Please note that citations in the Summary section refer to line number rather than page number, so this guide can be used with different editions of the play.", "summary": "Lear, the aging king of an ancient pre-Christian England, decides to retire. He will divide his kingdom between his three daughters, leaving them and their husbands to rule jointly. But before he tells them which portion of land they will receive, Lear demands that they answer one little question: which of them loves him the most? \nLear’s elder daughters, Goneril and Regan, praise their father obsequiously, and he rewards each of them—along with their husbands, Albany and Cornwall—with a third of the kingdom. He saves the best land for his favorite daughter, Cordelia. Cordelia, however, refuses to make a dishonest, toadying display of her love for her father as her sisters have. Outraged at her resistance, Lear curses and disowns her, ignoring the protests of his loyal advisor Kent, whom he exiles for his resistance. The King of France nevertheless marries Cordelia on the strength of her own merits, and Cordelia reluctantly departs, leaving her father in the care of her sisters.\nMeanwhile, Lear’s old friend, the Earl of Gloucester, has his own family troubles. Unbeknownst to him, his illegitimate son Edmund plots to betray his legitimate son Edgar and inherit his father’s title himself. Edmund plays on his father’s short temper and his brother’s trusting nature to trick Gloucester into believing that Edgar plans to kill Gloucester. Pursued by his father’s men, Edgar flees into the wilderness disguised as the mad beggar Poor Tom.\nKent also disguises himself as the rough-and-ready Caius and finds his way back into Lear’s service. He worries that Lear will have more trouble with his daughters than he bargained for, a suspicion shared by Lear’s beloved Fool.\nHaving relinquished his power, Lear finds that his temper tantrums no longer hold much sway over his children. When Goneril objects to his rowdy partying, he violently curses her and moves to Regan’s house. But Regan also refuses to house his drunken knights. The final straw comes when Regan puts the disguised Kent in the stocks, an insult to Lear’s authority. Maddened with rage, Lear runs out onto the wild heath amid a terrible storm. Kent and the Fool follow.\nOut in the storm, Lear loses his mind. As Kent and the Fool try to shelter him, they run into the disguised Edgar in a hovel. Edgar’s “madness” is so affecting that Lear strips naked in imitation of him, gaining a new understanding of the suffering of all the poor people in his kingdom. At last, Lear’s friends manage to get him into the hovel where he falls asleep. Gloucester arrives and warns them they need to leave. As a war for the kingdom brews between Goneril and Regan, the king must be protected quickly. Kent hurries Lear away, and the Fool mysteriously disappears from the play.\nMeanwhile, Edmund betrays Gloucester to the sisters, telling them that Gloucester knows of an invading French army led by Cordelia that intends to restore Lear to the throne. Regan and her husband Cornwall capture Gloucester and vengefully gouge out his eyes. A horrified servant who tries to stop them mortally wounds Cornwall in a struggle, leaving Regan open to accept Edmund’s seductions. Goneril’s husband, Albany, is disgusted and disturbed by his sadistic in-laws.\nThe blinded Gloucester is thrown out to wander on the heath, where a horrified Edgar finds him. Gloucester, not recognizing his son’s voice, asks “Poor Tom” to lead him to a cliff’s edge so he can kill himself. Edgar pulls a trick on his father, taking him to a patch of flat ground. When he tries to jump, Gloucester only falls on his face. Edgar, still pretending to be a stranger, tells him that he miraculously survived his fall.\nMeanwhile, Kent leads Lear to safety with the French army and Cordelia. Half-mad and wandering around with flowers in his hair, Lear meets the broken Gloucester and consoles him. He also apologizes to Cordelia, having learned to understand his own terrible mistakes.\nOn Edmund’s orders, Goneril’s servant Oswald tries to kill Gloucester. Edgar protects his father, by killing Oswald. On Oswald’s body, Edgar finds a letter from Goneril to Edmund in which she encourages Edmund to murder Albany and marry her.\nAs Regan and Goneril are fight over him, Edmund strategizes about how to kill Lear, Cordelia, and Edgar so he can marry one of the sisters and become king himself. In a great success for Edmund, the English forces defeat the French and capture the reconciled Cordelia and Lear.\nAfter the victory, Regan and Goneril fight openly over Edmund, but before anyone wins, Regan dies; Goneril poisoned her. Albany, who learned from the disguised Edgar about Goneril and Edmund’s plot against him, confronts his murderous wife who commits suicide. Albany joins Cordelia’s army.\nEdgar reveals his identity to Gloucester who dies of the shock. The grieving Edgar then presents himself in disguise as a challenger to Edmund. The fate of the kingdom will rest on which brother wins in combat. After a tense swordfight, Edgar defeats Edmund and dramatically reveals his identity. Dying, Edmund tells his brother that he gave orders for Lear and Cordelia to be hanged. Edgar and Albany rush to stop the execution, but they are too late: Cordelia is dead. Lear appears, carrying her dead body and howling with grief. His heart broken, Lear dies. \nKent, Albany, and Edgar are the only men left standing. Kent excuses himself, intending to follow his master Lear wherever he goes, even into death. Edgar and Albany are left alone to rebuild the shattered kingdom. Edgar closes the play with a shellshocked speech, declaring that the survivors must face this horrific time with honesty.", "url": "https://www.supersummary.com/king-lear/", "author": "William Shakespeare", "characters": {"Lear": "Lear is a mighty figure and a titan among Shakespeare’s tragic heroes. But he’s also a small-minded, ill-tempered, and self-involved old man—at least at the start. Lear’s initial bad decision to ask his daughters how much they love him before he’ll give them his kingdom sets the scene for the whole play. This demand suggests a world where love is nothing but an expression of power. Lear is fortunate to be truly loved by Cordelia, Kent, and his Fool, who refuse to play along with his manipulative game.As his plan backfires, Lear rediscovers his connection to reality over the course of the play. When he goes mad in the midst of a terrible storm, his madness paradoxically reconnects him to reality: he remembers that he, like Edgar’s beggar “Poor Tom,” is a “poor, bare, forked animal” (3.4.108), a mortal being in a painful and unpredictable world. Over the rest of the play, he acts on what he’s learned, consoling the blinded Gloucester, humbling himself before the wronged Cordelia, and submitting to imprisonment with a wisdom that comes from a sense that there are things in this world more important than power and status.But this isn’t a morality play—at least, not in the conventional sense—and Lear receives no reward for his education in harsh reality. Instead, he is forced to endure his beloved daughter’s senseless death. In his lament over her body, Lear asks the profound, broken, human question about the mortality of those we love: “Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life/And thou no breath at all?” (5.3.313-14)", "Cordelia": "Alone among her sisters, Cordelia is a truth-teller. Like Edgar, she’s a victim of her family’s schemes, shortsightedness, and selfishness. Unlike Edgar, she’s a shrewd seer right from the start, well aware that Lear’s manipulations fly in the face of real love. Cordelia’s profound courage and goodness are at first visible only to a few other clear-eyed characters: Kent, the Fool, and the King of France, who marries her and later helps her mount an invasion to save her father. Cordelia is Lear’s favorite, but he only comes to understand his daughter’s true worth after he rejects her for refusing to play along with his games. Her brutal and preventable death speaks to the play’s unflinching engagement with the world’s injustices. When the 17th-century playwright Nahum Tate reworked King Lear to be a little more palatable for squeamish audiences, he was so appalled by this ending that he rescued Cordelia and married her off to Edgar.", "Goneril": "Goneril is the eldest of Lear’s daughters. Like her sister Regan, she is conniving and selfish. But she’s also pitiable. She seems to be the least favorite of Lear’s daughters. Less tricky than Regan and less beloved than Cordelia, she’s set up to fail from the start in Lear’s “who-loves-me-most?” contest. And when Lear turns on her in anger, his curse entreating the gods to make her infertile draws attention to the fact that this eldest daughter, married for some time, is still childless. Her unhappy marriage to Albany degenerates over the course of the play, and when Regan’s lust for Edmund imperils Goneril’s own claim on Edmund’s heart, Goneril turns to murder, poisoning her own sister.", "Regan": "Regan is the middle child of the Lear family and the cleverest schemer of the bunch. Her cunning play off Goneril’s initial love-speech—“I love you just like Goneril says, but even more!”—suggests that she’s learned manipulation and power-lust at her father’s knee. Regan becomes steadily more frightening over the course of the play. She takes sadistic pleasure in gouging out Gloucester’s eyes and instructing that he be thrown out to “smell/his way to Dover” (3.7.94-95). Her eventual death-match with Goneril over Edmund’s favor—a death-match she loses—suggests a poisonous dynamic running deep in Lear’s family: these two sisters have been trained to believe that love and power are commodities that must be won at any cost.", "Edgar": "The earnest, trusting Edgar grows up fast over the course of the play. Gloucester’s legitimate son, he is easily fooled by the machinations of his half-brother Edmund. When he flees into the night, he chooses the least comfortable disguise he can, becoming the naked lunatic “Poor Tom.” His time as Poor Tom is as transformative for him as it is for Lear. In enacting the role of a gibbering and impoverished beggar, he comes into contact with a deep reality about human life: we’re all a suit of clothes and a roof away from our helpless animal nature, and we rely on each other to keep the wolves awayEdgar also becomes an artist through his disguise, constructing a vivid imaginary “cliff of Dover” to save his father’s life. When Edgar concludes that humans must “speak what we feel, not what we ought to say,” he’s refers to the truths that art can reveal as well, as the honesty of a person like Cordelia or Kent.", "Edmund": "The illegitimate Edmund is a charismatic, eloquent, and ruthless villain—right up until the end of his life. Embittered by his father Gloucester’s scorn for him, Edmund becomes obsessed with climbing the social ladder. He spends most of the play turning families against each other to further his own ends. He sows division between his father and his brother, and he encourages Goneril and Regan to fight—and ultimately die—for his love. But when Edgar at last defeats him, some glimmer of humanity seeps out of Edmund. Remembering that “Edmund was beloved,” he tries to stop Cordelia and Lear’s executions—executions he ordered. Many of the play’s questions about fate and character center on this complex figure.", "Gloucester": "The Earl of Gloucester, like his friend and counterpart Lear, begins the play hot-tempered and small-minded. Openly scornful of his illegitimate son Edmund, he is a despotic parent, demanding perfunctorily that Edmund show him his private correspondence. Unfortunately for him, this demand plays right into Edmund’s plan to disinherit his innocent half-brother Edgar. Gloucester’s immediate willingness to believe that his loving son Edgar wishes to kill him suggests his fearful limitations. Like Lear, he is so self-involved he can’t recognize love or treachery where he finds them. Ironically, it’s only after Gloucester is violently blinded that he can see the truth. ", "Kent": "The heartbreakingly loyal Kent sticks by Lear no matter what, understanding that the king needs support most when he is at his worst. Like Edgar, Kent finds freedom in his disguise. As Caius, he is able to speak bluntly for the first time. He takes great pleasure in doing so, as in Act 2, Scene 2 when he gleefully and colorfully insults Goneril’s servant Oswald. A pragmatist, Kent focuses on getting Lear out of the storm at all costs. But when his master finally dies, he is unable to continue living. ", "The Fool": "Like Kent and Cordelia, the Fool is willing to speak truth to power. Unlike Kent and Cordelia, the Fool gets away with it, precisely because he is a fool. This is a recurring character archetype that emerges in some form in most of Shakespeare’s plays, including As You Like It and A Midsummer Night’s Dream. A licensed jester who is allowed to say things to the King that no one else could, the Fool is the first to get through to Lear. He has genuine affection for his “nuncle Lear,” the same kind of honest love that motivates Cordelia to tell Lear what he really doesn’t want to hear. Some productions even cast the same actor as Cordelia and the Fool; they’re never on stage together. The Fool follows Lear willingly into the terrible storm, after which he disappears without explanation, mysteriously absorbed into the play’s darkness."}, "chapter_summaries": {"Act I, Scene 1 Summary": "Two noblemen, Kent and Gloucester, discuss a mysterious political change: the King plans to relinquish his power and divide his kingdom. Gloucester introduces Kent to his illegitimate son Edmund, making a few rude jokes about Edmund’s birth.King Lear arrives and welcomes his family members: his eldest daughter Goneril and her husband Albany, his middle daughter Regan and her husband Cornwall, and his youngest unmarried daughter Cordelia. Lear announces he will “shake all cares and business from our age,/Conferring them on younger strengths while we/Unburdened crawl toward death” (39-41). He intends to divide his kingdom between his daughters and to marry Cordelia to one of two suitors, the King of France or the Duke of Burgundy.Before relinquishing his kingdom, Lear insists that his daughters tell him: “Which of you shall we say doth love us most,/That we our largest bounty may extend/Where nature doth with merit challenge” (51-53).The two eldest daughters take turns lavishly praising their father. Goneril goes first and shamelessly flatters him; Regan follows, saying that she loves her father as Goneril does, only even more. The youngest daughter, Cordelia, listens in horror to this insincere display. When it is her turn, Lear expects that his favorite daughter will praise him the most. But Cordelia refuses to speak. Instead, she critiques her sisters’ false flattery.Enraged by Cordelia’s refusal to play along, Lear banishes her, stripping her of her dowry. The shocked Kent tries to tell his master this is a terrible mistake, but Lear only turns his fury on his loyal councillor, banishing him as well.Without her dowry, Cordelia is left to whichever prince is willing to take her. Burgundy withdraws his suit, but the King of France sees Cordelia’s wisdom and goodness. She accepts his offer of marriage and departs for his kingdom. As the scene ends, the two elder sisters talk privately, remarking that their father is senile. They have little sympathy for their exiled younger sister.  ", "Act I, Scene 2 Summary": "Edmund, Gloucester’s illegitimate son, delivers a soliloquy on the injustices of his position in life. He swears allegiance to Nature rather than the customs of a society that denies him rank and power because his father wasn’t married to his mother: “Why bastard? Wherefore base,/When my dimensions are as well compact,/my mind as generous, and my shape as true,/As honest madam’s issue?” (6-9). Embittered by his ill-treatment, he plots to turn Gloucester against his legitimate brother Edgar and take over the dukedom himself.Gloucester appears in a flurry, shocked at recent events, including Kent’s banishment, hostilities between France and England, and Lear’s abdication of the throne. As he bustles in, Edmund makes an obvious show of hiding a letter, which Gloucester insists on seeing. It is a fake letter from Edgar, composed by Edmund. In it, Edgar supposedly asks Edmund to assassinate Gloucester with him. Appalled, Gloucester asks Edmund to investigate further. He reflects that the astrological signs bode ill; the stars predict war and discord within families and nations.When Gloucester leaves, Edmund scoffs at his father’s superstition, maintaining that the stars have no effect on human character: “I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing” (131-133). Edgar interrupts his musings. Edmund tricks him into believing that Gloucester is enraged with him. Although Edmund says he will try to calm their father down, he warns his brother to carry a weapon. Frightened and overwhelmed, Edgar departs. Edmund rejoices. His father’s credulity and his brother’s innocence both serve his purposes.", "Act I, Scene 3 Summary": "Goneril storms onstage in a huff, asking her servant Oswald if Lear hit one of her men for provoking his Fool. She is fed up with her father’s behavior. He and his entourage of drunken knights party day and night in Goneril’s house. She tells Oswald she plans to avoid Lear for a while and that he should tell her father she’s sick if he asks for her. She also counsels Oswald and the rest of her staff to be as rude and lazy as they like around Lear and his men.", "Act I, Scene 4 Summary": "The banished Kent disguises himself as a rough servant named Caius so he can watch over Lear; his loyalty to his master outweighs all other concerns. As Caius, he presents himself to Lear’s crew of knights and quickly earns Lear’s trust when he upbraids Oswald—who, as Goneril instructed him, is blatantly rude to the former king. The Fool, Lear’s much-beloved jester, is heartbroken since Lear sent Cordelia away. He now emerges to read his master a lesson in his mistakes. When he sings a mocking song, and Lear ominously asks, “Dost thou call me fool, boy?”, he replies, “All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast born with” (145-47).As the Fool mocks Lear and his daughters, the furious Goneril enters. She tells her father she will no longer tolerate his chaotic knights, and he must send at least some of them away. Lear flies into a rage and curses his eldest child, calling on Nature to “Dry up in her the organs of increase” so that she’ll never have a child of her own (275). With that, he departs, intending to go to Regan’s house where he believes he can do what he wants. Goneril sends Oswald ahead to warn Regan and to tell her to hold firm with their father. Her husband Albany warns her that this may be a mistake.", "Act I, Scene 5 Summary": "Lear sends the disguised Kent to deliver a letter to Regan’s castle explaining what happened at Goneril’s house. Left alone with the Fool, Lear broods. The Fool gently teases him and tries to warn him that Regan isn’t likely to behave any differently than Goneril.Lear is shaken by his recent fits of uncontrollable rage. He fears for his sanity, saying, “O let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!/Keep me in temper; I would not be mad!” (43-44).", "Act II, Scene 1 Summary": "Edmund hears rumors about a war brewing between Albany and Cornwall, who both may have designs on the undivided throne. Regan and Cornwall will visit the Gloucester household that night, giving Edmund more opportunity to scheme. He continues his plot against his own family, telling Edgar: “My father watches. O sir, fly this place” (20). The enraged Gloucester, Edmund claims, is on Edgar’s trail, and Edmund will need to pretend to attack his brother in order to keep him safe. Edmund draws his sword, and the bewildered, frightened Edgar flees into the night. Edmund wounds himself to give the impression that Edgar injured him. When Gloucester appears, Edmund spins a tale in which Edgar mutters of patricide and chants magical charms. Crazed with rage and grief, Gloucester threatens to have his legitimate son killed and vows to grant Edmund his title and lands, just as Edmund plotted.Cornwall and Regan arrive and commiserate with Gloucester. They also swear friendship with Edmund, whom they see as a potentially useful man.", "Act II, Scene 2 Summary": "Goneril’s steward Oswald meets Kent outside Gloucester’s house. Kent, remembering Oswald’s rudeness to Lear, is accordingly rude to Oswald, going on an exuberant tirade against him: Oswald, Kent says, is: [a] knave, a rascal, an eater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered, action-taking, whoreson, glass-gazing, superservicable, finical rogue (13-17). At last, Kent draws his sword, and Oswald screams for help.Edmund, Gloucester, Regan, and Cornwall overhear the ruckus and confront the two men. Kent won’t budge, and Cornwall commands him to be put in the stocks for his insolence. Regan adds that, in spite of his old age, Kent must sit in the stocks all day and all night. With Kent imprisoned, everyone but Gloucester departs. Gloucester empathizes with Kent and says he will try to change Cornwall’s mind. Whatever happens, he and Kent both know that Lear won’t take this well; it is a serious insult for Cornwall to put Lear’s servant in the stocks.", "Act II, Scene 3 Summary": "Edgar, on the run, pauses to deliver a soliloquy. Confused and terrified, he considers his options, all of which are bad. Nowhere is safe, and no friendly face can be trusted. His best option is to disguise himself as someone no one looks at twice. He decides to dress up as a vagrant madman called Poor Tom, vowing, “[M]y face I’ll grime with filth,/Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots,/And with presented nakedness outface/The winds and persecutions of the sky” (9-12). He will chant nonsense, beg for alms, and entirely unmake himself: “Edgar I nothing am” (21), he says.", "Act II, Scene 4 Summary": "Lear and the Fool arrive at Gloucester’s house and find Kent in the stocks outside. Lear is outraged and unbelieving, shocked that Cornwall would dare to disrespect his servant this way. Kent also tells Lear that Oswald delivered letters from Goneril ahead of his arrival. The Fool isn’t surprised; this is exactly what he predicted, and he sings cryptic little songs to that effect.Lear rushes off and returns with Gloucester who tries to calm him down. Cornwall delayed his meeting with Lear, refusing to jump at the former king’s command. When Cornwall and Regan eventually arrive, Lear is furious with them, and they coolly condescend to him. When Goneril appears, the two sisters present a united face against their father, asking him why he needs even one servant, let alone his retinue of rowdy knights. As before, Lear flies into a rage, calling Regan “a boil,/A plague-sore, or embossèd carbuncle,/In my corrupted blood” (222-224).As madness descends upon him, Lear flees from the house, pursued by the Fool and Kent. In spite of Gloucester’s appalled protests, his family lets him go. There is a violent storm brewing, and the family is reluctant to follow Lear into it.", "Acts I-II Analysis": "The first acts of King Lear gather like the storm that breaks at the end of Act II. The play begins with a queasy lightning flash: Lear’s manipulative question to his daughters. Right away, readers are exposed to a world in which love is corrupted into a tool for maintaining power. In relinquishing his kingdom to his children, Lear attempts to exert a deeper power through emotional backchannels, demanding that his daughters bow to his demands for a very specific kind of affection and attention. As Cordelia points out, these demands border on emotional incest. Something is thoroughly out of order in Lear’s kingdom, and the balance of nature is about to set it right, through means that no mere human is going to like very much.The daughters’ different responses to Lear’s manipulation set up one of the play’s big themes: reality and self-delusion. Cordelia’s refusal to play her father’s game infuriates him because he doesn’t get to bask in obsequious praise. More than that, however, the refusal is a critique of Lear’s emotional dishonesty, revealing that his self-image can’t stand up to resistance or disagreement. He depends on the belief that he’s the finest father and the best king in all the world, and any threat to that belief shakes his whole worldview. As Regan points out, “[H]e hath ever but slenderly known himself” (1.1.298-99). Lear, like all the play’s characters, will reckon with what he really is over the course of the play.Questions of truth and deception touch on every character’s predicament. The parallel stories of Edmund and Edgar provide a piquant example. Edmund, Gloucester’s illegitimate son, uses deception to rise to a noble position that feels truer to his self-image, but this new reality is based entirely on treacherous falsehoods. Meanwhile, Edgar, the legitimate son, finds truth through his seemingly false disguise as the mad “Poor Tom.” The play repeatedly insists that public status and honor are essentially worthless. Contact with reality and with one’s true self involves complete humility, even abasement. In turn, pride and power sever the play’s characters from reality and the perceptions of others.These early acts also set up two contrasting views of man and nature, one of which is exemplified by Lear and Gloucester, while the other is exemplified by Edmund. Lear and his ilk profess faith in the old Medieval traditions of noble birth and kingly patriarchy. When this worldview is shattered by his daughters’ lack of deference, Lear devolves into madness. Edmund, meanwhile, represents the “New Man” emerging in Shakespeare’s time. This figure rejects Lear’s Medieval worldview and instead adopts a Hobbesian view of the world in which all men war against one another for an advantage. This is reflected in Edmund’s self-interested schemes which recall Machiavelli’s 1513 book The Prince. Though written almost one hundred years earlier, The Prince remained highly influential in Shakespeare’s era.  ", "Act III, Scene 1 Summary": "Out on the heath in a raging storm, Kent meets a gentleman who tells him he’s seen Lear, running wild and shouting into the wind and rain. The conditions are so wild that even “the cub-drawn bear would couch,/The lion and the belly-pinchèd wolf/Keep their fur dry” (12-14). Yet the elderly and maddened Lear is exposed to the elements. Kent warns this gentleman that Albany and Cornwall are secretly plotting against each other and that the King of France—Cordelia’s new husband—plans to invade and take the country back from these treacherous dukes. If the gentleman goes to Dover, he can deliver news of Lear’s plight and give Cordelia Kent’s ring as a token. The gentleman agrees, and Kent rushes off to search for Lear.", "Act III, Scene 2 Summary": "Lear, followed by the loyal Fool, spits fury at the weather: Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage, blow!/You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout/Till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the cocks./You sulph’rous and thought-executing fires,/Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts,/Singe my white head (1-6). The Fool struggles to get his master to shelter. Lear continues to rage at the sky, and the sky rages back.Kent joins the Fool in an attempt to get Lear into the shelter of a nearby hovel. Lear comes back to himself for a moment, understanding that he’s losing his mind. He also returns to the people around him, asking the Fool: “How dost, my boy? Art cold?/I am cold myself” (69-70). He agrees to go to the hovel. The shaken Fool ends the scene with a cryptic prophecy of confusion and danger in England.", "Act III, Scene 3 Summary": "Gloucester confides in Edmund: he is appalled by the way Lear’s daughters treat their father. When he objected, he reports, Cornwall and Regan turned him out of his own house and forbade him from communicating with Lear. He goes on, explaining the two dukes’ secret enmity and telling Edmund he received a confidential letter about the approaching French invasion. He plans to rescue Lear, regardless of Cornwall and Regan’s prohibitions.All of these confidences play right into Edmund’s hands. After his father departs, he vows, “This courtesy forbid thee shall the duke/Instantly know, and of that letter too,” and relishes his imminent victory: “The younger rises when the old doth fall” (20-24).", "Act III, Scene 4 Summary": "Kent leads Lear and the Fool to the hovel. Still bewailing his daughters’ betrayal, Lear hurries his friends in first. In a moment of lucidity, he pauses to think of all the “poor naked wretches” (30) enduring this storm with him even now. Just then, a scream comes from within the hovel, and the Fool rushes out, claiming there’s a lunatic inside. This is “lunatic” is Edgar, deep in disguise as the beggar Poor Tom. Edgar raves, speaking of “the foul fiend” and singing snatches of bawdy ballads. Lear takes to this madman immediately and personally, believing that only treacherous daughters like his own could have made this man so mad. He deliriously interrogates Edgar and strips off his own clothing in imitation of this naked beggar. The beleaguered Fool tries to forestall him: “Prithee, nuncle, be contented; ‘tis a naughty night to swim in” (110-11). Gloucester arrives. Without recognizing his own son, he hurries the group toward a safe house. Edgar must listen and keep his disguise up as Gloucester describes his son’s supposed betrayal, lamenting, “I loved him, friend,/No father his son dearer” (167-68).", "Act III, Scene 5 Summary": "Edmund delivers his father’s intelligence about the French invasion directly to Cornwall, who hurries to inform Regan. Cornwall also tells Edmund that his betrayal of his father has made him the Earl of Gloucester. Edmund will take his father’s title, and Cornwall will treat him as his own son. ", "Act III, Scene 6 Summary": "Kent and Gloucester bring Lear to a safe house. Edgar keeps up his mad ranting, speaking of damnation. Lear, spurred on, hallucinates an imaginary courtroom in which he puts his daughters on trial while the Fool and Edgar play along with his delusions. Edgar is so moved to intense pity by Lear’s madness that his tears threaten his disguise.At last, Lear falls into a troubled sleep. Gloucester and Kent return to collect him in a litter vehicle and carry him to Dover, where Cordelia’s army will offer him sanctuary. Everyone departs but Edgar, who remains to reflect on his experience with the king: “How light and portable my pain seems now,/When that which makes me bend makes the king bow” (107-108).", "Act III, Scene 7 Summary": "Goneril, Regan, Albany, Cornwall, and Edmund meet to plot revenge on Gloucester, whom they’ve captured for supporting Cordelia and rescuing Lear. Goneril and Edmund depart to prepare for war, leaving Regan and Cornwall to deal with Gloucester.The bloodthirsty couple tie Gloucester up and interrogate him, ignoring his cries for decency and mercy. When he doesn’t give them the answers they want, Cornwall puts out one of his eyes. Regan won’t be satisfied until he puts out the other. But as Cornwall moves to do just this, one of his horrified servants, horrified tries to fight him off. After a bloody struggle, Cornwall kills him and completes the job, blinding Gloucester as he recites these terrible words: “Out, vile jelly./Where is thy luster now?” (84-85). When Gloucester howls for Edmund, Cornwall and Regan reveal that Edmund betrayed him. They throw him out into the storm again to “smell/his way to Dover” (94-95). Cornwall realizes his servant mortally wounded him.The scene ends as two traumatized servants make plans to help the unfortunate Gloucester, bandaging his bleeding eye sockets and finding him a guide.", "Act III Analysis": "Act III contains one of the most famous scenes in all of world literature: Lear’s mad caper in the storm. An image of man as a tiny, angry, frightened speck amid wild nature, the storm scene is at once harrowing and blackly comical. Through this confrontation between despair and absurdity, the play’s most vivid picture of the human condition emerges.As Lear leaps around naked and Edgar rants and raves, a strange coherence emerges from their lunacy. While Edgar’s madness is feigned and Lear’s is true, both men come to a deeper understanding of their own natures—and human nature—through their seeming disconnect from reality. For Edgar, the externalizing of his internal predicament as a loveless exile driven to despair by treachery provides a strange relief; his mad-speak is as inventive and exuberant as it is horrific. For Lear, the sight of Edgar’s naked misery brings him to the realization that every man, himself included, is nothing but a “poor, bare, forked animal” (3.4.108). It’s through this realization that Lear finds his way to empathy for the first time—an empathy that demands he relinquish his puffed-up self image as mighty king. Later, this behavior will be referred to as “reason in madness.” This runs counter to Edmund and Cornwall’s “madness in reason,” a self-interested rationality that results in so much blood and death. These scenes also mark the beginning of Edgar’s role as an artist. Just as Edgar externalizes his misery in a kind of performance art, he provides a model and a mirror for Lear. Lear sees himself in Edgar, even accusing Edgar’s nonexistent daughters of having brought him to this pass, and finds a curious relief in that seeing. While the play offers no pat answers to questions of human suffering and human evil, it suggests that one way to grapple with these concepts is by creating artistic reflections of them—the better to see them, feel them, and even play with them. The poet John Keats would later remark on this quality in King Lear, writing that its truthfulness makes it beautiful even though it depicts horrors.But art isn’t a total solution to the mysteries of evil and pain, and Gloucester’s gruesome blinding makes that very clear. This scene is at once symbolic—Gloucester, who has proven so bad at seeing what’s true, can only see what’s real after he loses his literal eyes—and nastily concrete. The sadistic Cornwall’s cry, “Out, vile jelly./Where is thy luster now?” (3.7.84-85), returns us once more to the irreducible facts of the human body: its vulnerability and its mortality. ", "Act IV, Scene 1 Summary": "Having resigned himself to his terrible circumstances, Edgar believes he’s hit such an absolute low that there’s nowhere to go but up. At that moment, he sees the blinded Gloucester led by an old man and concludes, “The worst is not/So long as we can say, ‘This is the worst’” (27-28). Edgar presents himself as a guide to the miserable Gloucester, who wants to be led to the cliffs of Dover, where he can throw himself to his death. The old man leading Gloucester protests that Edgar is a madman; Gloucester, unperturbed, replies, “‘Tis the time’s plague when madmen lead the blind” (48). Although Edgar can barely keep up his act, he agrees to guide his father to the cliffs.", "Act IV, Scene 2 Summary": "Goneril, Oswald, and Edmund discuss changes they’ve observed in Albany, who now seems to have qualms about his family’s behavior, particularly Goneril’s. Goneril is neither surprised nor upset. She wants to marry Edmund now, and Albany can die for all she cares. Goneril and Edmund part with a kiss, and she sighs, “O, the difference of man and man:/To thee a woman’s services are due;/My fool usurps my body” (26-28). Albany enters and roundly curses his wife, accusing her of vicious cruelty to her father whom he remembers as a good and righteous king. Goneril retorts that she doesn’t expect Albany to step up and repel the French invaders.In the midst of their fight, a messenger brings news that Cornwall, stabbed by his servant during Gloucester’s blinding, is dead. Aghast to hear of the blinding, Albany wonders why Edmund didn’t stand in Cornwall’s way. Privately, he asks the messenger for more of the story.", "Act IV, Scene 3 Summary": "Kent meets with a gentleman who brings news of the invasion. The King of France rushed home to deal with a domestic problem, leaving behind a general to take charge of the war. Cordelia, who remains in England, was horrified to hear of her father’s suffering. Kent remarks that human personalities must be determined by the stars; how else could such a kind woman have two villainous sisters.Kent tells the gentleman that, though Lear is safe, he will resist seeing his loyal daughter. Lear’s terrible choices, Kent adds, “sting/His mind so venomously that burning shame/Detains him from Cordelia” (46-48). Kent, meanwhile, must take care of some secret business. He leaves Lear in the gentleman’s care.", "Act IV, Scene 4 Summary": "Cordelia consults with a doctor about her father. She laments that Lear was discovered, completely mad, singing to himself and wearing a crown of flowers and weeds. She wonders desperately if anything can cure him; the doctor advises her that what he needs is sleep. Cordelia sends men to find her father so she can keep him under her protection.A messenger arrives to tell Cordelia that the British forces are marching toward them. Cordelia prepares for war, motivated by love rather than power. She says, “No blown ambition doth our arms incite,/But love, dear love, and our aged father’s right” (27-28).", "Act IV, Scene 5 Summary": "Regan and Oswald discuss imminent war plans. Regan is less interested in the details of the fight than in Goneril’s communications with Edmund. Like her elder sister, Regan wants to marry him and feels her claim is better. She tells Oswald, “My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talked,/And more convenient is he for my hand/Than for your lady’s” (33-35). ", "Act IV, Scene 6 Summary": "Edgar claims to have led Gloucester to the cliffs of Dover. In reality, they are on a flat patch of ground. Edgar falsely describes the dizzying view from the heights above the sea: “The murmuring surge/That on th’ unnumb’red idle pebble chafes/Cannot be heard so high. I’ll look no more, Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight/Topple down headlong” (20-24). At first, Gloucester is suspicious, noting that the ground feels pretty flat and that his guide’s voice has changed. Ultimately, he accepts Edgar’s fiction and prepares himself for death. But when he tries to throw himself over the imaginary cliff, Gloucester merely falls on his face. Using a new voice, Edgar tells him that he survived a fall from a terrible height, characterizing the event as a miracle. He adds that Gloucester’s guide was a thousand-nosed demon and that Gloucester was saved by some divine intervention. Shaken, Gloucester resolves to endure his pain until he dies naturally. The mad Lear arrives wearing his flower crown. He speaks nonsense, seeing imaginary animals and phantom daughters while singing songs about lechery, corruption, and the stench of mortality. Like the Fool and Edgar before him, Lear’s madness demonstrates more understanding of the world than his sanity did. Gloucester recognizes his king by the sound of his voice, but Lear does not recognize Gloucester. In his insanity, Lear mocks him, telling him to read nonexistent papers that Gloucester couldn’t see even if they existed and admonishing him, “What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes with no eyes” (150-151). Finally, Lear recognizes Gloucester and sits down to console him as he weeps. “Thou must be patient,” he tells him: “We came crying hither;/Thou know’st, the first time that we smell the air/We wawl and cry” (178-80).Cordelia’s gentlemen arrive to take Lear to safety. He impishly runs away from them. Edgar collects news of the impending battle from one of these gentlemen and then reintroduces himself to Gloucester as a sane man offering to guide him.Oswald interrupts them and intends to murder Gloucester. Edgar fights and slays him. With his dying breath, Oswald tells Edgar to carry a letter to Edmund. It is a love letter from Goneril in which she begs Edmund to kill Albany and marry her. Edgar vows to stand in Edmund’s way. But first, he must take his father to a safe place.", "Act IV, Scene 7 Summary": "Cordelia and Kent reunite. She thanks him profusely for taking care of her father. The doctor tells Cordelia that Lear is now safely asleep, bathed, and dressed. Upon seeing him, Cordelia is deeply moved by the sight of her frail old father asleep after his ordeal, remarking, “Was this a face/To be opposed against the jarring winds?” (32-33). Still apparently mad, Lear wakes up and chides Cordelia for waking him from death. Yet he quickly comes back to himself, newly humbled and self-aware. He tells her, “Pray, do not mock me./I am a very foolish fond old man […] And, to deal plainly, I fear I am not in my perfect mind […] Do not laugh at me;/For, as I am a man, I think this lady/To be my child Cordelia” (61-72). Cordelia weeps as father and daughter reconcile.Kent and a gentleman discuss the imminent war and the bloody battle to come.", "Act V, Scene 1 Summary": "At the head of a crowd of soldiers, Edmund and Regan discuss Albany’s wavering and Oswald’s disappearance. Regan quizzes Edmund on whether he slept with Goneril, which he denies.Goneril and Albany interrupt this conversation. Albany tells them that Lear is with Cordelia. Goneril suggests that they all unite against France since France is their common enemy. As Goneril and Regan jockey to prevent each other from being with Edmund alone, the three exit together.Edgar appears to Albany in disguise, gives him a letter, and tells him that if the English forces are victorious over the French, Albany should sound a trumpet to summon a champion who will help him. Edmund reappears and tells Albany it is time to fight. Left alone, Edmund addresses the audience. Having sworn love to both Goneril and Regan, he muses over whether to sleep with “[b]oth? One? Or neither? Neither can be enjoyed,/If both remain alive” (59-60). He also vows that if his forces win the battle, both Cordelia and Lear will receive no mercy.", "Act V, Scene 2 Summary": "Edgar leads Gloucester away from the battle, concealing him in the shadow of a tree. Shortly thereafter, he returns and tells Gloucester that all is lost. With Cordelia’s forces defeated, Gloucester must flee. Gloucester resists, wanting only to die, but Edgar chides him: “What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure/Their going hence, even as their coming hither;/Ripeness is all” (9-11). Gloucester follows him.", "Act V, Scene 3 Summary": "The triumphant Edmund enters with his captives, Lear and Cordelia, and instructs guards to take them to prison. Cordelia laments their fate, saying she could tolerate her own fall but not her father’s. Lear gently calms her: “Come, let’s away to prison./We two alone will sing like birds i’ th’ cage” (8-9). Edmund sends an ominous soldier after them with bloody instructions.Albany demands that Edmund surrender the captives so that Albany may treat them fairly. Edmund weasels his way around this request, and Albany warns him he shouldn’t take liberties: he’s a subject, not a brother. Regan rebukes Albany, warning him that when she marries Edmund, the two men will be brothers. Goneril pushes back, and the two women squabble over Edmund in Albany’s face.Based on the letter Edgar gave him, Albany arrests Edmund on charges of treason. He sounds the trumpet to summon the mysterious champion Edgar promised. Regan, overcome with a sudden sickness, is carried away. In private, Goneril gloats that she poisoned her sister. The champion appears: It is Edgar himself in another disguise. He accuses Edmund of treachery and conspiracy and challenges him to a final duel. The brothers battle, and Edgar mortally wounds Edmund.Albany produces Goneril’s letter to Edmund, confirming the charges against him and implicating her. Desperate, Goneril runs away. The dying Edmund readily admits to all of the charges laid at his feet and asks who it is that killed him. Edgar reveals himself at last, and Edmund marvels, “The wheel is come full circle” (176).Edgar explains to Albany that Gloucester is dead. When Edgar revealed his identity, Gloucester’s “flawed heart—/Alack, too weak the conflict to support—/‘Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,/Burst smilingly” (199-202). Moved by this story, Edmund asks Edgar to go on; Edgar duly recounts his reunion with the disguised Kent, during which the two men shared their stories of exile. A gentleman rushes in screaming that Goneril poisoned Regan and killed herself. Kent arrives asking after Lear, and Albany demands that Edmund tell them where the king and his daughter are. Edmund, slowly dying, reflects on the deaths of the two women who loved him and makes a new resolve: “Some good I mean to do,/Despite of mine own nature” (248-49). Before he is carried away to die offstage, he tells Albany to rush to the castle to halt Lear and Cordelia’s execution.But it is too late. Lear appears carrying Cordelia’s hanged body and crying “Howl, howl, howl!” (263). The stunned onlookers watch as Lear wails over his daughter’s corpse: “Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,/And thou no breath at all? Thou’lt come no more,/Never, never, never, never, never” (313-15). In despair, Lear too dies. Shocked and grieving, Albany turns to Kent and Edgar, begging them to rule the kingdom. Kent refuses, saying he has other work to do: “I have a journey, sir, shortly to go./My master calls me; I must not say no” (328-29).Edgar and Albany are left alone to try to heal the broken state. Edgar closes the play with these solemn words: “The weight of this sad time we must obey,/Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say./The oldest hath borne most; we that are young/Shall never see so much, nor live so long” (330-33).", "Acts IV-V Analysis": "The agony of the last acts of King Lear is all the powerful because Shakespeare sets readers up for a happier ending than he delivers. Shortly before the tragic conclusion, many characters come to terms with their ordeals and find ways to endure. Edgar uses the power of language to persuade Gloucester that, even blind and miserable, his life is a miracle. Lear finds an impish kindness in the depths of his madness, begs Cordelia’s forgiveness, and faces imprisonment with humble courage. Edmund has a deathbed change of heart and renounces his villainies, remembering that he was once beloved. But all these glimmers of hope meet with a universe full of incomprehensible cruelty.The end of the play is famously brutal. Lear howls over Cordelia’s corpse, speaking words that will resonate with anyone who has ever grieved: “Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,/And thou no breath at all? Thou’lt come no more,/Never, never, never, never, never” (5.3.313-15). Here, Lear confronts the horrors of human evil and the final incomprehensibility of mortality. His chilling refrain of “Never” suggests a man trying to make himself understand a word in a foreign language. Cordelia’s death is unnatural but also inevitable; as Macbeth remarks of his dead wife in his eponymous play, “She should have died hereafter.” Death comes to all, and that is the final inscrutable darkness everyone must confront.The senselessness of Cordelia’s death was deeply disturbing to audiences throughout the play’s life. One watcher, the 17th-century playwright Nahum Tate, was so appalled by this ending that he rewrote the play to rescue Cordelia and marry her off to Edgar. But Shakespeare’s King Lear offers no such consolations. How humans live in the face of arbitrary, senseless death is the play’s great question.King Lear offers only a ghost of an answer, a spark in the darkness. By the end of the play, nearly everyone is dead or about to be dead—the loyal Kent implies that he’ll follow Lear into death. Only Albany and Edgar remain. Edgar, who transformed his pain into art over the course of the play, gets the final words, a commentary on words themselves. In order to “obey” the gravity of this hideous moment, Edgar says they must “[s]peak what we feel, not what we ought to say” (5.3.331). To speak the truth is to admit what we do not know and to refuse to escape into fantasy and self-delusion as so many characters do during the play. Only by meeting pain head-on can humans live complete and honest lives."}}, "num_tokens": 95900}
