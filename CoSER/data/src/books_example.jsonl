{"title": "Pride and Prejudice", "author": "Jane Austen", "content": "Pride and Prejudice\n\nBy Jane Austen\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 1.\n\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in\n\npossession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\n\nHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man\n\nmay be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so\n\nwell fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is  considered the rightful property of some one or other of their  daughters.\n\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" said his lady to him one day, \"have\n\nyou heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?\"\n\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.\n\n\"But it is,\" returned she; \"for Mrs. Long has just been here,\n\nand she told me all about it.\"\n \nMr. Bennet made no answer.\n \n\"Do you not want to know who has taken it?\" cried his\n\nwife impatiently.\n\n\"  You  want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing\n\nit.\"\n \nThis was invitation enough.\n\n\n\n\"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that\n\nNetherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the\n\nnorth of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise\n\nand four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it,  that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take  possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to\n\nbe in the house by the end of next week.\"\n\n\"What is his name?\"\n \n\"Bingley.\"\n\n\"Is he married or single?\"\n\n\"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large\n\nfortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our\n\ngirls!\"\n\n\"How so? How can it affect them?\"\n \n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be\n\nso tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his\n\nmarrying one of them.\"\n\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\n\n\"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very\n\nlikely that he MAY fall in love with one of them, and\n\ntherefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.\"\n\n\n\n\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or\n\nyou may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still\n\nbetter, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr.\n\nBingley may like you the best of the party.\"\n\n\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly HAVE had my share\n\nof beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary\n\nnow. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought\n\nto give over thinking of her own beauty.\"\n\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to\n\nthink of.\"\n \n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley\n\nwhen he comes into the neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\n\n\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an\n\nestablishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and\n\nLady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for US to visit him if you do\n\nnot.\"\n \n\"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley  will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by  you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying\n\n\n\nwhichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a\n\ngood word for my little Lizzy.\"\n\n\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better\n\nthan the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\n\nJane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving  her  the preference.\"\n\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\"\n\nreplied he; \"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but\n\nLizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bennet, how  can  you abuse your own children in\n\nsuch a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no\n\ncompassion for my poor nerves.\"\n\n\"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your\n\nnerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention\n\nthem with consideration these last twenty years at least.\"\n\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife\n\nunderstand his character.  Her  mind was less difficult to\n\ndevelop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little  information, and uncertain temper. When she was\n\ndiscontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her\n\nlife was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting\n\nand news.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.\n\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on  Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till\n\nthe evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of\n\nit. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing  his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly\n\naddressed her with:\n \n\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\"\n\n\"We are not in a way to know  what  Mr. Bingley likes,\"\n\nsaid her mother resentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\n\n\"But you forget, mamma,\" said Elizabeth, \"that we shall\n\nmeet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to\n\nintroduce him.\"\n \n\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She\n\nhas two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical\n\nwoman, and I have no opinion of her.\"\n\n\"No more have I,\" said Mr. Bennet; \"and I am glad to find\n\nthat you do not depend on her serving you.\"\n\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to\n\ncontain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\n\n\n\n\"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a\n\nlittle compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\"\n\n\"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,\" said her father;\n\n\"she times them ill.\"\n \n\"I do not cough for my own amusement,\" replied Kitty\n\nfretfully. \"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\"\n\n\"To-morrow fortnight.\"\n\n\"Aye, so it is,\" cried her mother, \"and Mrs. Long does not\n\ncome back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her\n\nto introduce him, for she will not know him herself.\"\n \n\"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your\n\nfriend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to  her .\"\n \n\"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not\n\nacquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?\"\n\n\"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance\n\nis certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is  by the end of a fortnight. But if  we  do not venture somebody  else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her daughters must\n\nstand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of\n\nkindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.\"\n\n\n\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,\n\n\"Nonsense, nonsense!\"\n \n\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\"\n\ncried he. \"Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the  stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree  with you  there . What say you, Mary? For you are a young\n\nlady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and\n\nmake extracts.\"\n \nMary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\n\n\"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,\" he continued, \"let us\n\nreturn to Mr. Bingley.\"\n\n\"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,\" cried his wife.\n\n\"I am sorry to hear  that ; but why did not you tell me that\n\nbefore? If I had known as much this morning I certainly\n\nwould not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have\n\nactually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance\n\nnow.\"\n \nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished;\n\nthat of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when\n\nthe first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it\n\nwas what she had expected all the while.\n\n\n\n\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew\n\nI should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls\n\ntoo well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I\n\nam! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone\n\nthis morning and never said a word about it till now.\"\n\n\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\" said\n\nMr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with\n\nthe raptures of his wife.\n\n\"What an excellent father you have, girls!\" said she, when\n\nthe door was shut. \"I do not know how you will ever make\n\nhim amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At\n\nour time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be  making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we  would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you  are  the\n\nyoungest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the\n\nnext ball.\"\n \n\"Oh!\" said Lydia stoutly, \"I am not afraid; for though I  am\n\nthe youngest, I'm the tallest.\"\n\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how\n\nsoon he would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining\n\nwhen they should ask him to dinner.\n\n\n\nChapter 3.\n\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of\n\nher five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to  draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr.\n\nBingley. They attacked him in various ways--with barefaced\n\nquestions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he  eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to  accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady\n\nLucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had\n\nbeen delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully  handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he  meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing\n\ncould be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain\n\nstep towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr.\n\nBingley's heart were entertained.\n\n\"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\n\nNetherfield,\" said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \"and all the\n\nothers equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\"\n\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had\n\nentertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young\n\nladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only  the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they  had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that\n\nhe wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.\n\n\n\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to\n\ndo credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which\n\ndeferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the  following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour  of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted.\n\nShe could not imagine what business he could have in town so\n\nsoon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear  that he might be always flying about from one place to  another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.\n\nLady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his\n\nbeing gone to London only to get a large party for the ball;  and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring  twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.\n\nThe girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were\n\ncomforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of  twelve he brought only six with him from London--his five  sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly\n\nroom it consisted of only five altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two\n\nsisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.\n\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His\n\nsisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His\n\nbrother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but  his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by  his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the\n\nreport which was in general circulation within five minutes\n\n\n\nafter his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The  gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the\n\nladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley,\n\nand he was looked at with great admiration for about half the  evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide  of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be\n\nabove his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\n\nlarge estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a  most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being  unworthy to be compared with his friend.\n\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the\n\nprincipal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,  danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early,  and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable\n\nqualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between\n\nhim and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.  Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced  to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking\n\nabout the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own\n\nparty. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most  disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he  would never come there again. Amongst the most violent\n\nagainst him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general\n\nbehaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\n\nhaving slighted one of her daughters.\n\n\n\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentle men, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that\n\ntime, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear\n\na conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from\n\nthe dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\n\n\"Come, Darcy,\" said he, \"I must have you dance. I hate to\n\nsee you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You\n\nhad much better dance.\"\n \n\"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I\n\nam particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an\n\nassembly as this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are\n\nengaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it\n\nwould not be a punishment to me to stand up with.\"\n\n\"I would not be so fastidious as you are,\" cried Mr.\n\nBingley, \"for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with\n\nso many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and\n\nthere are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.\"\n\n\"  You  are dancing with the only handsome girl in the\n\nroom,\" said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\n\n\"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But\n\nthere is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is  very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my\n\npartner to introduce you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Which do you mean?\" and turning round he looked for a\n\nmoment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his\n\nown and coldly said: \"She is tolerable, but not handsome\n\nenough to tempt  me ; I am in no humour at present to give  consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.  You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for\n\nyou are wasting your time with me.\"\n\nMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story, however, with great spirit among her\n\nfriends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which\n\ndelighted in anything ridiculous.\n\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much\n\nadmired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced\n\nwith her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.  Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be,  though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure. Mary\n\nhad heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\n\naccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and  Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners,  which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.\n\nThey returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the\n\nvillage where they lived, and of which they were the principal  inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he  was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\n\n\n\ngood deal of curiosity as to the events of an evening which  had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped\n\nthat his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed;\n\nbut he soon found out that he had a different story to hear.\n\n\"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we\n\nhave had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I\n\nwish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could\n\nbe like it. Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr.  Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her  twice! Only think of  that , my dear; he actually danced with\n\nher twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he\n\nasked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was\n\nso vexed to see him stand up with her! But, however, he did  not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he\n\nseemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the\n\ndance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\n\nasked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with\n\nMiss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two\n\nfifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the\n\nboulanger --\"\n \n\"If he had had any compassion for  me  ,\" cried her husband\n\nimpatiently, \"he would not have danced half so much! For\n\nGod's sake, say no more of his partners. O that he had\n\nsprained his ankle in the first place!\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so\n\nexcessively handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I\n\nnever in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.\n\nI dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst's gown--\"\n\nHere she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery. She was therefore obliged to\n\nseek another branch of the subject, and related, with much\n\nbitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking\n\nrudeness of Mr. Darcy.\n\n\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not\n\nlose much by not suiting  his  fancy; for he is a most\n\ndisagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high  and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked  here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not\n\nhandsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there,\n\nmy dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite\n\ndetest the man.\"\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 4.\n\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had\n\nbeen cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed\n\nto her sister just how very much she admired him.\n\n\"He is just what a young man ought to be,\" said she,\n\n\"sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy\n\nman-ners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!\"\n\n\"He is also handsome,\" replied Elizabeth, \"which a young\n\nman ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is\n\nthereby complete.\"\n\n\"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a\n\nsecond time. I did not expect such a compliment.\"\n\n\"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great\n\ndifference between us. Compliments always take  you  by  surprise, and  me  never. What could be more natural than his  asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were\n\nabout five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.\n\nNo thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.\"\n\n\"Dear Lizzy!\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people\n\nin general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are\n\ngood and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill\n\nof a human being in your life.\"\n\n\"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I\n\nalways speak what I think.\"\n\n\"I know you do; and it is  that  which makes the wonder.\n\nWith  your  good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies\n\nand nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common\n\nenough--one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid\n\nwithout ostentation or design--to take the good of everybody's\n\ncharacter and make it still better, and say nothing of the badbelongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters, too,  do you? Their manners are not equal to his.\"\n\n\"Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women\n\nwhen you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with  her brother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if  we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her.\"\n\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their\n\nbehaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in  general; and with more quickness of observation and less  pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too\n\nunassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little\n\ndisposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies;  not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in\n\n\n\nthe power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it,  but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had\n\nbeen educated in one of the first private seminaries in town,\n\nhad a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of  spending more than they ought, and of associating with  people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to\n\nthink well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of\n\na respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance  more deeply impressed on their memories than that their  brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.\n\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a\n\nhundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended  to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley\n\nintended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his\n\ncounty; but as he was now provided with a good house and\n\nthe liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who  best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not  spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the\n\nnext generation to purchase.\n\nHis sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he was now only established as a tenant,  Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his\n\ntable--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more\n\nfashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as  her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age  two years, when he was tempted by an accidental\n\n\n\nrecommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at\n\nit, and into it for half-an hour--was pleased with the situation\n\nand the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in\n\nits praise, and took it immediately.\n\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Bingley\n\nwas endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and\n\nductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a  greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never  appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard,\n\nBingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the\n\nhighest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior.  Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He  was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and\n\nhis manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that\n\nrespect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure  of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually  giving offense.\n\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly\n\nwas sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with  more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody\n\nhad been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no\n\nformality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the\n\nroom; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel  more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection  of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for\n\n\n\nnone of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none\n\nreceived either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he\n\nacknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.\n\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they would not object to know more of.\n\nMiss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and\n\ntheir brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of\n\nher as he chose.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 5.\n\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William  Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had\n\nmade a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of\n\nknighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.  The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had  given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a\n\nsmall market town; and, in quitting them both, he had\n\nremoved with his family to a house about a mile from  Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where  he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,\n\nunshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil\n\nto all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not  render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention  to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging,\n\nhis presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.\n\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent\n\nyoung woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate\n\nfriend.\n \nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet\n\nto talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning\n\nafter the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear\n\nand to communicate.\n\n\n\n\"  You  began the evening well, Charlotte,\" said Mrs. Bennet\n\nwith civil self-command to Miss Lucas. \"  You  were Mr.\n\nBingley's first choice.\"\n\n\"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.\"\n \n\"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with\n\nher twice. To be sure that  did  seem as if he admired her-\n\nindeed I rather believe he  did --I heard something about it-but I\n\nhardly know what--something about Mr. Robinson.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr.\n\nRobinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking\n\nhim how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did\n\nnot think there were a great many pretty women in the room,\n\nand  which  he thought the prettiest? and his answering  immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,\n\nbeyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'\"\n\n\"Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that\n\ndoes seem as if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you\n\nknow.\"\n \n\" My  overhearings were more to the purpose than  yours\n\n,\n\nEliza,\" said Charlotte. \"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just\n\ntolerable .\"\n\n\n\n\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed\n\nby his ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it\n\nwould be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long\n\ntold me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour\n\nwithout once opening his lips.\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?\"\n\nsaid Jane. \"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\"\n\n\"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked  Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said  he seemed quite angry at being spoke to.\"\n\n\"Miss Bingley told me,\" said Jane, \"that he never speaks\n\nmuch, unless among his intimate acquaintances. With  them  he\n\nis remarkably agreeable.\"\n\n\"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so\n\nvery agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can\n\nguess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride,  and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not  keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.\"\n\n\"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\" said Miss\n\nLucas, \"but I wish he had danced with Eliza.\"\n \n\"Another time, Lizzy,\" said her mother, \"I would not dance\n\nwith  him , if I were you.\"\n\n\n\n\"I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you  never  to dance\n\nwith him.\"\n \n\"His pride,\" said Miss Lucas, \"does not offend  me  so much\n\nas pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One  cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family,  fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of\n\nhimself. If I may so express it, he has a  right  to be proud.\"\n\n\"That is very true,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and I could easily\n\nforgive  his  pride, if he had not mortified  mine .\"\n \n\"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the\n\nsolidity of her reflections, \"is a very common failing, I\n\nbelieve. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is  very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone  to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a\n\nfeeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or\n\nother, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things,  though the words are often used synonymously. A person may  be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion\n\nof ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of\n\nus.\"\n \n\"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\" cried a young Lucas, who\n\ncame with his sisters, \"I should not care how proud I was. I\n\nwould keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a\n\nday.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\"\n\nsaid Mrs. Bennet; \"and if I were to see you at it, I should take\n\naway your bottle directly.\"\n\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the\n\nvisit.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 6.\n\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of\n\nNetherfield. The visit was soon returned in due form. Miss\n\nBennet's pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs.\n\nHurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to\n\nbe intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a  wish of being better acquainted with THEM was expressed  towards the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received\n\nwith the greatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw\n\nsuperciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly  excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though  their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in\n\nall probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.\n\nIt was generally evident whenever they met, that he DID admire her and to HER it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain\n\nfor him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in\n\nlove; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to  be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with  great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a\n\nuniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from\n\nthe suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her\n\nfriend Miss Lucas.\n \n\"It may perhaps be pleasant,\" replied Charlotte, \"to be able\n\nto impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a\n\ndisadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her\n\n\n\naffection with the same skill from the object of it, she may  lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor\n\nconsolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is\n\nso much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment,  that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all BEGIN  freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\n\nvery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love\n\nwithout encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had  better show MORE affection than she feels. Bingley likes  your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like\n\nher, if she does not help him on.\"\n\n\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will  allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a  simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too.\"\n\n\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's\n\ndisposition as you do.\"\n\n\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not\n\nendeavour to conceal it, he must find it out.\"\n \n\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though\n\nBingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be\n\nemployed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make\n\nthe most of every half-hour in which she can command his\n\n\n\nattention. When she is secure of him, there will be more\n\nleisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.\"\n\n\"Your plan is a good one,\" replied Elizabeth, \"where noth\n\ning is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I  were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare  say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane's feelings; she is\n\nnot acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the\n\ndegree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has  known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him  at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and\n\nhas since dined with him in company four times. This is not\n\nquite enough to make her understand his character.\"\n\n\"Not as you represent it. Had she merely DINED with him,\n\nshe might only have discovered whether he had a good\n\nappetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also\n\nbeen spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal.\"\n\n\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain\n\nthat they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with\n\nrespect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine\n\nthat much has been unfolded.\"\n \n\"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I wish Jane success with all my\n\nheart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should\n\nthink she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to\n\nbe studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in  marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of\n\n\n\nthe parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so  similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\n\nleast. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike\n\nafterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to\n\nknow as little as possible of the defects of the person with\n\nwhom you are to pass your life.\"\n\n\"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You\n\nknow it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way\n\nyourself.\"\n\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her\n\nsister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself\n\nbecoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.  Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he\n\nhad looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when\n\nthey next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner\n\nhad he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly  had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was  rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression\n\nof her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others\n\nequally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye  more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was  forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and\n\nin spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the\n\nfashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.  Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man\n\n\n\nwho made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not\n\nthought her handsome enough to dance with.\n\nHe began to wish to know more of her, and as a step\n\ntowards conversing with her himself, attended to her  conversation with others. His doing so drew her notice. It was  at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.\n\n\"What does Mr. Darcy mean,\" said she to Charlotte, \"by\n\nlistening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?\"\n\n\"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\"\n\n\"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know\n\nthat I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I\n\ndo not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow\n\nafraid of him.\"\n \nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without\n\nseeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied\n\nher friend to mention such a subject to him; which  immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him\n\nand said:\n \n\"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself\n\nuncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel\n\nForster to give us a ball at Meryton?\"\n\n\n\n\"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes\n\na lady energetic.\"\n\n\"You are severe on us.\"\n \n\"It will be HER turn soon to be teased,\" said Miss Lucas.\n\n\"I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what\n\nfollows.\"\n \n\"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--\n\nalways wanting me to play and sing before anybody and  everybody! If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would  have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit\n\ndown before those who must be in the habit of hearing the\n\nvery best performers.\" On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,  she added, \"Very well, if it must be so, it must.\" And gravely  glancing at Mr. Darcy, \"There is a fine old saying, which\n\neverybody here is of course familiar with: 'Keep your breath\n\nto cool your porridge'; and I shall keep mine to swell my\n\nsong.\"\n\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means\n\ncapital. After a song or two, and before she could reply to the\n\nentreaties of several that she would sing again, she was  eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who  having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the\n\nfamily, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments,\n\nwas always impatient for display.\n\n\n\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air\n\nand conceited manner, which would have injured a higher\n\ndegree of excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy  and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure,  though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a\n\nlong concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\n\nScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters,\n\nwho, with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers,\n\njoined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.\n\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a\n\nmode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all  conversation, and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to  perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir\n\nWilliam thus began:\n\n\"What a charming amusement for young people this is,  Mr. Darcy! There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider  it as one of the first refinements of polished society.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in\n\nvogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every\n\nsavage can dance.\"\n\nSir William only smiled. \"Your friend performs\n\ndelightfully,\" he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley\n\njoin the group; \"and I doubt not that you are an adept in the\n\nscience yourself, Mr. Darcy.\"\n\n\n\n\"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure\n\nfrom the sight. Do you often dance at St. James's?\"\n\n\"Never, sir.\"\n \n\"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the\n\nplace?\"\n\n\"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can\n\navoid it.\"\n \n\"You have a house in town, I conclude?\"\n \nMr. Darcy bowed.\n\n\"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself-for\n\nI am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.\"\n\nHe paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was\n\nnot disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant\n\nmoving towards them, he was struck with the action of doing\n\na very gallant thing, and called out to her:\n\n\"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr.\n\nDarcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as\n\na very desirable partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am\n\n\n\nsure when so much beauty is before you.\" And, taking her  hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though\n\nextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she\n\ninstantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir\n\nWilliam:\n \n\"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I\n\nentreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to\n\nbeg for a partner.\"\n\nMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed\n\nthe honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined;\n\nnor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at\n\npersuasion.\n\n\"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is\n\ncruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this\n\ngentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no\n\nobjection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.\"\n\n\"Mr. Darcy is all politeness,\" said Elizabeth, smiling.\n\n\"He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear\n\nMiss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who\n\nwould object to such a partner?\"\n\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking\n\n\n\nof her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss\n\nBingley:\n\n\"I can guess the subject of your reverie.\"\n\n\"I should imagine not.\"\n\n\"You are considering how insupportable it would be to\n\npass many evenings in this manner--in such society; and\n\nindeed I am quite of your opinion. I was never more annoyed!\n\nThe insipidity, and yet the noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!\"\n\n\"You conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind\n\nwas more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the  very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a  pretty woman can bestow.\"\n\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and\n\ndesired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring\n\nsuch reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:\n\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\"\n \n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!\" repeated Miss Bingley. \"I am all\n\nastonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?--and\n\npray, when am I to wish you joy?\"\n\n\n\n\"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.\n\nA lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration\n\nto love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you\n\nwould be wishing me joy.\"\n\n\"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter\n\nis absolutely settled. You will be having a charming motherin-\n\nlaw, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley\n\nwith you.\"\n\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference while she\n\nchose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his\n\ncomposure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed\n\nlong.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 7.\n\nMr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant\n\nrelation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her\n\nsituation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her  father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four  thousand pounds.\n\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a\n\nclerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a\n\nbrother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.\n\nThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from\n\nMeryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies,\n\nwho were usually tempted thither three or four times a week,  to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over  the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and\n\nLydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their\n\nminds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing  better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse  their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening;\n\nand however bare of news the country in general might be,\n\nthey always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At  present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and  happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the\n\nneighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and\n\nMeryton was the headquarters.\n\n\n\nTheir visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to\n\ntheir knowledge of the officers' names and connections. Their\n\nlodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to  know the officers themselves. Mr. Phillips visited them all,  and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown\n\nbefore. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.\n\nBingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.\n\nAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this\n\nsubject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed:\n\n\"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you\n\nmust be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have\n\nsuspected it some time, but I am now convinced.\"\n\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but\n\nLydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in\n\nthe course of the day, as he was going the next morning to\n\nLondon.\n \n\"I am astonished, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that you\n\nshould be so ready to think your own children silly. If I\n\nwished to think slightingly of anybody's children, it should\n\nnot be of my own, however.\"\n\n\n\n\"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible\n\nof it.\"\n \n\"Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\"\n\n\"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not  agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every  particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two\n\nyoungest daughters uncommonly foolish.\"\n\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to  have the sense of their father and mother. When they get to  our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more\n\nthan we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat\n\nmyself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if  a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,  should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I\n\nthought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night\n\nat Sir William's in his regimentals.\"\n\n\"Mamma,\" cried Lydia, \"my aunt says that Colonel Forster\n\nand Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as\n\nthey did when they first came; she sees them now very often\n\nstanding in Clarke's library.\"\n\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the\n\nfootman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from\n\nNetherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. Mrs.\n\n\n\nBennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,\n\n\"Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does\n\nhe say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my\n\nlove.\"\n \n\"It is from Miss Bingley,\" said Jane, and then read it aloud.\n\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND,-\n\n\"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with  Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for  the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two\n\nwomen can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you\n\ncan on receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to\n\ndine with the officers.--Yours ever,\n \n\"CAROLINE BINGLEY\"\n \n\"With the officers!\" cried Lydia. \"I wonder my aunt did\n\nnot tell us of THAT.\"\n \n\"Dining out,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"that is very unlucky.\"\n\n\"Can I have the carriage?\" said Jane.\n\n\"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it\n\nseems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.\"\n\n\n\n\"That would be a good scheme,\" said Elizabeth, \"if you\n\nwere sure that they would not offer to send her home.\"\n\n\"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to\n\ngo to Meryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\"\n\n\"I had much rather go in the coach.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am\n\nsure. They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?\"\n\n\"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get\n\nthem.\"\n \n\"But if you have got them to-day,\" said Elizabeth, \"my\n\nmother's purpose will be answered.\"\n\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go\n\non horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with\n\nmany cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were\n\nanswered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.  Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.  The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;\n\nJane certainly could not come back.\n\n\"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\" said Mrs. Bennet  more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her  own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all\n\n\n\nthe felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over  when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note\n\nfor Elizabeth:\n \n\"MY DEAREST LIZZY,-\n \n\"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose,  is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My\n\nkind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better.\n\nThey insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not\n\nmuch the matter with me.--Yours, etc.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had  read the note aloud, \"if your daughter should have a  dangerous fit of illness--if she should die, it would be a\n\ncomfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and\n\nunder your orders.\"\n\n\"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of\n\nlittle trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as\n\nshe stays there, it is all very well. I would go an see her if I\n\ncould have the carriage.\"\n\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no\n\nhorsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared\n\nher resolution.\n\n\n\n\"How can you be so silly,\" cried her mother, \"as to think of\n\nsuch a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen\n\nwhen you get there.\"\n\n\"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.\"\n\n\"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,\" said her father, \"to send for\n\nthe horses?\"\n \n\"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance\n\nis nothing when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be\n\nback by dinner.\"\n\n\"I admire the activity of your benevolence,\" observed\n\nMary, \"but every impulse of feeling should be guided by\n\nreason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in\n\nproportion to what is required.\"\n\n\"We will go as far as Meryton with you,\" said Catherine\n\nand Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three\n\nyoung ladies set off together.\n\n\"If we make haste,\" said Lydia, as they walked along,\n\n\"perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he\n\ngoes.\"\n\nIn Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jump\n\n\n\ning over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient  activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house,\n\nwith weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with\n\nthe warmth of exercise.\n \nShe was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but\n\nJane were assembled, and where her appearance created a\n\ngreat deal of surprise. That she should have walked three\n\nmiles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by\n\nherself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss\n\nBingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in\n\ncontempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by\n\nthem; and in their brother's manners there was something  better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.  Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The\n\nformer was divided between admiration of the brilliancy\n\nwhich exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to  the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter  was thinking only of his breakfast.\n\nHer inquiries after her sister were not very favourably\n\nanswered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very  feverish, and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth  was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had\n\nonly been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or\n\ninconvenience from expressing in her note how much she  longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was  not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss\n\n\n\nBingley left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she\n\nwas treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.\n\nWhen breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The\n\napothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as\n\nmight be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and  that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to  return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\n\nwas followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased,\n\nand her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room\n\nfor a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the\n\ngentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do\n\nelsewhere.\n \nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must\n\ngo, and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the  carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it,\n\nwhen Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss\n\nBingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to\n\nLongbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back\n\na supply of clothes.\n\n\n\nChapter 8.\n\nAt five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-\n\npast six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil  inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had\n\nthe pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of\n\nMr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer.  Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved,\n\nhow shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively\n\nthey disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more\n\nof the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not\n\nimmediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment\n\nof all her former dislike.\n \nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and\n\nthey prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she\n\nbelieved she was considered by the others. She had very little  notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr.  Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by\n\nwhom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only\n\nto eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to\n\nprefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\n\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and\n\nMiss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the\n\nroom. Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a\n\n\n\nmixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation,\n\nno style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added:\n\n\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an\n\nexcellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this\n\nmorning. She really looked almost wild.\"\n\n\"She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my\n\ncountenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must SHE\n\nbe scampering about the country, because her sister had a\n\ncold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!\"\n\n\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six\n\ninches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown\n\nwhich had been let down to hide it not doing its office.\"\n\n\"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,\" said Bingley;\n\n\"but this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth\n\nBennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room\n\nthis morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.\"\n\n\"YOU observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss\n\nBingley; \"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish\n\nto see YOUR sister make such an exhibition.\"\n \n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or\n\nwhatever it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!\n\n\n\nWhat could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-\n\ntown indifference to decorum.\"\n \n\"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\"\n\nsaid Bingley.\n\n\"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\" observed Miss Bingley in a half\n\nwhisper, \"that this adventure has rather affected your\n\nadmiration of her fine eyes.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" he replied; \"they were brightened by the\n\nexercise.\" A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst\n\nbegan again:\n\n\"I have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is\n\nreally a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were\n\nwell settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low\n\nconnections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.\"\n\n\"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney\n\non Meryton.\"\n\n\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near\n\nCheapside.\"\n\n\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed\n\nheartily.\n\n\n\n\"If they had uncles enough to fill ALL Cheapside,\" cried\n\nBingley, \"it would not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\n\n\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of\n\nmarrying men of any consideration in the world,\" replied\n\nDarcy.\n\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters\n\ngave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some\n\ntime at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.\n\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till\n\nsummoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth\n\nwould not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had  the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her  rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs\n\nherself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole\n\nparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but  suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and  making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for\n\nthe short time she could stay below, with a book. Mr. Hurst\n\nlooked at her with astonishment.\n \n\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather\n\nsingular.\"\n\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards.\n\nShe is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\n\n\n\n\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried\n\nElizabeth; \"I am NOT a great reader, and I have pleasure in\n\nmany things.\"\n\n\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\" said  Bingley; \"and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her  quite well.\"\n\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked\n\ntowards the table where a few books were lying. He  immediately offered to fetch her others--all that his library\n\nafforded.\n \n\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and\n\nmy own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not\n\nmany, I have more than I ever looked into.\"\n\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly\n\nwith those in the room.\n \n\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father\n\nshould have left so small a collection of books. What a\n\ndelightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\n\n\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of\n\nmany generations.\"\n\n\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are\n\nalways buying books.\"\n\n\n\n\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in\n\nsuch days as these.\"\n\n\"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the\n\nbeauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build YOUR\n\nhouse, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.\"\n\n\"I wish it may.\"\n\n\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in\n\nthat neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.\n\nThere is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.\"\n\n\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy\n\nwill sell it.\"\n \n\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible\n\nto get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\n\nElizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to\n\nleave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it  wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed  herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe\n\nthe game.\n\n\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss\n\nBingley; \"will she be as tall as I am?\"\n\n\n\n\"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's\n\nheight, or rather taller.\"\n\n\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody\n\nwho delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such  manners! And so extremely accomplished for her age! Her  performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.\"\n\n\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can\n\nhave patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.\"\n\n\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do\n\nyou mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover\n\nscreens, and net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot  do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of  for the first time, without being informed that she was very\n\naccomplished.\"\n\n\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said  Darcy, \"has too much truth. The word is applied to many a  woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse\n\nor covering a screen. But I am very far from agreeing with\n\nyou in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of  knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my  acquaintance, that are really accomplished.\"\n\n\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\n\n\n\n\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great\n\ndeal in your idea of an accomplished woman.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\n\n\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be  really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass  what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough\n\nknowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the\n\nmodern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this,  she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of  walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or\n\nthe word will be but half-deserved.\"\n \n\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this  she must yet add something more substantial, in the  improvement of her mind by extensive reading.\"\n\n\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing ONLY six\n\naccomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing\n\nANY.\"\n \n\"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the\n\npossibility of all this?\"\n\n\"I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and\n\ntaste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.\"\n\n\n\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that\n\nthey knew many women who answered this description, when\n\nMr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\n\nroom.\n \n\"Elizabeth Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was  closed on her, \"is one of those young ladies who seek to  recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their\n\nown; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my\n\nopinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was\n\nchiefly addressed, \"there is a meanness in ALL the arts which\n\nladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.\n\nWhatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.\"\n\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply\n\nas to continue the subject.\n\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was\n\nworse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr.  Jones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced  that no country advice could be of any service, recommended\n\nan express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.\n\nThis she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that\n\n\n\nMr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss  Bennet were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite\n\nuncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.\n\nThey solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention\n\nmight be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 9.\n\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received\n\nfrom Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards\n\nfrom the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite  of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent  to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her\n\nown judgement of her situation. The note was immediately\n\ndispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs.  Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached  Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\n\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet\n\nwould have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing  her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her  recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would\n\nprobably remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen,\n\ntherefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried home;  neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time,  think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane,\n\non Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and\n\nthree daughter all attended her into the breakfast parlour.  Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found  Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\n\n\"Indeed I have, sir,\" was her answer. \"She is a great deal\n\ntoo ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of\n\n\n\nmoving her. We must trespass a little longer on your\n\nkindness.\"\n \n\"Removed!\" cried Bingley. \"It must not be thought of. My\n\nsister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.\"\n \n\"You may depend upon it, Madam,\" said Miss Bingley,\n\nwith cold civility, \"that Miss Bennet will receive every\n\npossible attention while she remains with us.\"\n\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\n\n\"I am sure,\" she added, \"if it was not for such good friends\n\nI do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill\n\nindeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest\n\npatience in the world, which is always the way with her, for  she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever  met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to HER.\n\nYou have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming\n\nprospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the  country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of  quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short\n\nlease.\"\n \n\"Whatever I do is done in a hurry,\" replied he; \"and  therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should  probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I\n\nconsider myself as quite fixed here.\"\n\n\n\n\"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\" said\n\nElizabeth.\n \n\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\" cried he, turning\n\ntowards her.\n \n\"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.\"\n\n\"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so\n\neasily seen through I am afraid is pitiful.\"\n\n\"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep,\n\nintricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as\n\nyours.\"\n\n\"Lizzy,\" cried her mother, \"remember where you are, and\n\ndo not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at\n\nhome.\"\n \n\"I did not know before,\" continued Bingley immediately,\n\n\"that your were a studier of character. It must be an amusing\n\nstudy.\"\n\n\"Yes, but intricate characters are the MOST amusing. They\n\nhave at least that advantage.\"\n\n\"The country,\" said Darcy, \"can in general supply but a\n\nfew subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you\n\nmove in a very confined and unvarying society.\"\n\n\n\n\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is\n\nsomething new to be observed in them for ever.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner\n\nof mentioning a country neighbourhood. \"I assure you there is\n\nquite as much of THAT going on in the country as in town.\"\n\nEverybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her\n\nfor a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied\n\nshe had gained a complete victory over him, continued her\n\ntriumph.\n\n\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the\n\ncountry, for my part, except the shops and public places. The\n\ncountry is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?\"\n\n\"When I am in the country,\" he replied, \"I never wish to\n\nleave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same.\n\nThey have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy\n\nin either.\"\n \n\"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But\n\nthat gentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the\n\ncountry was nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,\" said Elizabeth,  blushing for her mother. \"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He  only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be\n\n\n\nmet with in the country as in the town, which you must\n\nacknowledge to be true.\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not\n\nmeeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe  there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with  four and-twenty families.\"\n\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to\n\nkeep his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and  directed her eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive  smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might\n\nturn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas\n\nhad been at Longbourn since HER coming away.\n\n\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an\n\nagreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So\n\nmuch the man of fashion! So genteel and easy! He had always\n\nsomething to say to everybody. THAT is my idea of good  breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very  important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the\n\nmatter.\"\n \n\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\n\n\"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the\n\nmince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants\n\nthat can do their own work; MY daughters are brought up\n\nvery differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves,\n\n\n\nand the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is  a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlotte so\n\nVERY plain--but then she is our particular friend.\"\n\n\"She seems a very pleasant young woman.\"\n\n\"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady\n\nLucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I\n\ndo not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one\n\ndoes not often see anybody better looking. It is what  everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she  was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner's in\n\ntown so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure\n\nhe would make her an offer before we came away. But,  however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young.  However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they\n\nwere.\"\n \n\"And so ended his affection,\" said Elizabeth impatiently.  \"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same  way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in\n\ndriving away love!\"\n\n\"I have been used to consider poetry as the FOOD of\n\nlove,\" said Darcy.\n\n\"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes\n\nwhat is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of\n\n\n\ninclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it\n\nentirely away.\"\n\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued\n\nmade Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing  herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing  to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating\n\nher thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an\n\napology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was  unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister  to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She\n\nperformed her part indeed without much graciousness, but\n\nMrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her\n\ncarriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put  herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each\n\nother during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the\n\nyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his\n\nfirst coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\n\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine\n\ncomplexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite\n\nwith her mother, whose affection had brought her into public  at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of  natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers,\n\nto whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own easy manners\n\nrecommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very  equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the  ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it\n\n\n\nwould be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not  keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to\n\ntheir mother's ear:\n \n\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my  engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if  you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not\n\nwish to be dancing when she is ill.\"\n\nLydia declared herself satisfied. \"Oh! yes--it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when\n\nyou have given YOUR ball,\" she added, \"I shall insist on their\n\ngiving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a\n\nshame if he does not.\"\n \nMrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and\n\nElizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her\n\nrelations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr.\n\nDarcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of HER, in spite of all Miss Bingley's\n\nwitticisms on FINE EYES.\n\n\n\nChapter 10.\n\nThe day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs.  Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and\n\nin the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-\n\nroom. The loo-table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was  writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the  progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention\n\nby messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at\n\npiquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.\n\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his\n\ncompanion. The perpetual commendations of the lady, either\n\non his handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the  length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her  praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was\n\nexactly in union with her opinion of each.\n\n\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a\n\nletter!\"\n \nHe made no answer.\n \n\"You write uncommonly fast.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.\"\n\n\n\n\"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the\n\ncourse of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I\n\nshould think them!\"\n \n\"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of\n\nyours.\"\n\n\"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.\"\n\n\"I have already told her so once, by your desire.\"\n\n\"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for\n\nyou. I mend pens remarkably well.\"\n\n\"Thank you--but I always mend my own.\"\n\n\"How can you contrive to write so even?\"\n\nHe was silent.\n \n\"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement\n\non the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures\n\nwith her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it\n\ninfinitely superior to Miss Grantley's.\"\n\n\"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write\n\nagain? At present I have not room to do them justice.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But\n\ndo you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr.\n\nDarcy?\"\n\n\"They are generally long; but whether always charming it\n\nis not for me to determine.\"\n \n\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long\n\nletter with ease, cannot write ill.\"\n\n\"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\"\n\ncried her brother, \"because he does NOT write with ease. He\n\nstudies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you,\n\nDarcy?\"\n\n\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Miss Bingley, \"Charles writes in the most\n\ncareless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and\n\nblots the rest.\"\n \n\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express  them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas  at all to my correspondents.\"\n\n\"Your humility, Mr. Bingley,\" said Elizabeth, \"must\n\ndisarm reproof.\"\n\n\n\n\"Nothing is more deceitful,\" said Darcy, \"than the\n\nappearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of\n\nopinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.\"\n\n\"And which of the two do you call MY little recent piece\n\nof modesty?\"\n\n\"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your\n\ndefects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding\n\nfrom a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution,  which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.  The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized\n\nmuch by the possessor, and often without any attention to the\n\nimperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet  this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting  Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it\n\nto be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet\n\nwhat is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must  leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real  advantage to yourself or anyone else?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at\n\nnight all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And  yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be\n\ntrue, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did\n\nnot assume the character of needless precipitance merely to\n\nshow off before the ladies.\"\n\n\n\n\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means\n\nconvinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your\n\nconduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any\n\nman I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend  were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you  would probably do it, you would probably not go--and at\n\nanother word, might stay a month.\"\n\n\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr.\n\nBingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have\n\nshown him off now much more than he did himself.\"\n \n\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your\n\nconverting what my friend says into a compliment on the  sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a  turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he\n\nwould certainly think better of me, if under such a\n\ncircumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as\n\nI could.\"\n \n\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your\n\noriginal intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering\n\nto it?\"\n \n\"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter;\n\nDarcy must speak for himself.\"\n\n\"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose\n\nto call mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing\n\n\n\nthe case, however, to stand according to your representation,  you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is\n\nsupposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his\n\nplan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one\n\nargument in favour of its propriety.\"\n\n\"To yield readily--easily--to the PERSUASION of a friend\n\nis no merit with you.\"\n\n\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the\n\nunderstanding of either.\"\n\n\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the\n\ninfluence of friendship and affection. A regard for the\n\nrequester would often make one readily yield to a request,  without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not  particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed\n\nabout Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\n\ncircumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his\n\nbehaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases  between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the\n\nother to change a resolution of no very great moment, should\n\nyou think ill of that person for complying with the desire,\n\nwithout waiting to be argued into it?\"\n\n\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this\n\nsubject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of\n\nimportance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the\n\ndegree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?\"\n\n\n\n\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the\n\nparticulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size;\n\nfor that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet,\n\nthan you may be aware of. I assure you, that if Darcy were not  such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should  not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not know a\n\nmore awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in\n\nparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday\n\nevening, when he has nothing to do.\"\n\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could\n\nperceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked\n\nher laugh. Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had  received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such\n\nnonsense.\n \n\"I see your design, Bingley,\" said his friend. \"You dislike\n\nan argument, and want to silence this.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If\n\nyou and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the\n\nroom, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever\n\nyou like of me.\"\n\n\"What you ask,\" said Elizabeth, \"is no sacrifice on my\n\nside; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.\"\n\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\n\n\n\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley\n\nmoved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite\n\nrequest that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as\n\npolitely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.\n\nMrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus\n\nemployed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned\n\nover some music-books that lay on the instrument, how  frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her. She hardly  knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\n\nadmiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at\n\nher because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could  only imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice  because there was something more wrong and reprehensible,\n\naccording to his ideas of right, than in any other person\n\npresent. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too\n\nlittle to care for his approbation.\n\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the\n\ncharm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy,\n\ndrawing near Elizabeth, said to her:\n\n\"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize\n\nsuch an opportunity of dancing a reel?\"\n\nShe smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question,\n\nwith some surprise at her silence.\n\n\n\n\"Oh!\" said she, \"I heard you before, but I could not\n\nimmediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I\n\nknow, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of\n\ndespising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those  kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated  contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that\n\nI do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you\n\ndare.\"\n \n\"Indeed I do not dare.\"\n \nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was\n\namazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness\n\nand archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to\n\naffront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by  any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it\n\nnot for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some\n\ndanger.\n\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane\n\nreceived some assistance from her desire of getting rid of\n\nElizabeth.\n \nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his\n\nhappiness in such an alliance.\n\n\n\n\"I hope,\" said she, as they were walking together in the\n\nshrubbery the next day, \"you will give your mother-in-law a\n\nfew hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the\n\nadvantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it,  do sure the younger girls of running after officers. And, if I  may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that\n\nlittle something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,\n\nwhich your lady possesses.\"\n\n\"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic\n\nfelicity?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt\n\nPhillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth's\n\npicture, you must not have it taken, for what painter could do\n\njustice to those beautiful eyes?\"\n\n\"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but\n\ntheir colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine,\n\nmight be copied.\"\n\nAt that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs.\n\nHurst and Elizabeth herself.\n \n\"I did not know that you intended to walk,\" said Miss\n\nBingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.\n\n\n\n\"You used us abominably ill,\" answered Mrs. Hurst,\n\n\"running away without telling us that you were coming out.\"\n\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left\n\nElizabeth to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr.\n\nDarcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said:\n\n\"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better\n\ngo into the avenue.\"\n\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain\n\nwith them, laughingly answered:\n\n\"No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped,\n\nand appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would\n\nbe spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye.\"\n\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was\n\nalready so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a\n\ncouple of hours that evening.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 11.\n\nWhen the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two\n\nfriends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had\n\nnever seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour  which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of  conversation were considerable. They could describe an\n\nentertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour,\n\nand laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.\n\nBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward\n\nDarcy, and she had something to say to him before he had\n\nadvanced many steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet,  with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight  bow, and said he was \"very glad;\" but diffuseness and warmth\n\nremained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and\n\nattention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire,  lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she  removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that\n\nshe might be further from the door. He then sat down by her,\n\nand talked scarcely to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the\n\nopposite corner, saw it all with great delight.\n\nWhen tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law\n\nof the card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private\n\nintelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr.\n\n\n\nHurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole\n\nparty on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had\n\ntherefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the  sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did  the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing\n\nwith her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her\n\nbrother's conversation with Miss Bennet.\n \nMiss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through HIS book, as in\n\nreading her own; and she was perpetually either making some\n\ninquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him,  however, to any conversation; he merely answered her  question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the\n\nattempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only\n\nchosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a  great yawn and said, \"How pleasant it is to spend an evening  in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like\n\nreading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\n\nbook! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if\n\nI have not an excellent library.\"\n\nNo one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw\n\naside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for\n\nsome amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball\n\nto Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:\n\n\n\n\"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a\n\ndance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you deter\n\nmine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am\n\nmuch mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball\n\nwould be rather a punishment than a pleasure.\"\n\n\"If you mean Darcy,\" cried her brother, \"he may go to bed,\n\nif he chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a\n\nsettled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup\n\nenough, I shall send round my cards.\"\n\n\"I should like balls infinitely better,\" she replied, \"if they\n\nwere carried on in a different manner; but there is something\n\ninsufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It  would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of  dancing were made the order of the day.\"\n\n\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it\n\nwould not be near so much like a ball.\"\n \nMiss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room. Her figure was elegant,\n\nand she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed,\n\nwas still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings,  she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth,\n\nsaid:\n\n\n\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my\n\nexample, and take a turn about the room. I assure you it is\n\nvery refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.\"\n\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss  Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility;  Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of\n\nattention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and\n\nunconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to join  their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine  but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the\n\nroom together, with either of which motives his joining them\n\nwould interfere. \"What could he mean? She was dying to  know what could be his meaning?\"--and asked Elizabeth\n\nwhether she could at all understand him?\n \n\"Not at all,\" was her answer; \"but depend upon it, he\n\nmeans to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing\n\nhim will be to ask nothing about it.\"\n\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing\n\nMr. Darcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring\n\nan explanation of his two motives.\n\n\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\" said\n\nhe, as soon as she allowed him to speak. \"You either choose\n\nthis method of passing the evening because you are in each\n\nother's confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or\n\nbecause you are conscious that your figures appear to the\n\n\n\ngreatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be  completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you\n\nmuch better as I sit by the fire.\"\n\n\"Oh! shocking!\" cried Miss Bingley. \"I never heard  anything so abominable. How shall we punish him for such a  speech?\"\n\n\"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\" said\n\nElizabeth. \"We can all plague and punish one another. Tease\n\nhim- laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it\n\nis to be done.\"\n \n\"But upon my honour, I do NOT. I do assure you that my\n\nintimacy has not yet taught me THAT. Tease calmness of  manner and presence of mind! No, no--feel he may defy us  there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you\n\nplease, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy\n\nmay hug himself.\"\n\n\"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\" cried Elizabeth. \"That\n\nis an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will\n\ncontinue, for it would be a great loss to ME to have many\n\nsuch acquaintances. I dearly love a laugh.\"\n\n\"Miss Bingley,\" said he, \"has given me more credit than\n\ncan be. The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and\n\nbest of their actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person\n\nwhose first object in life is a joke.\"\n\n\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Elizabeth--\"there are such people, but I\n\nhope I am not one of THEM. I hope I never ridicule what is\n\nwise and good. Follies and nonsense, whims and\n\ninconsistencies, DO divert me, I own, and I laugh at them  whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what you\n\nare without.\"\n \n\"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been\n\nthe study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often\n\nexpose a strong understanding to ridicule.\"\n\n\"Such as vanity and pride.\"\n\n\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there\n\nis a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good\n\nregulation.\"\n\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\n\n\"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\" said\n\nMiss Bingley; \"and pray what is the result?\"\n\n\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no\n\ndefect. He owns it himself without disguise.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension. I have\n\nfaults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My  temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yieldingcertainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot\n\n\n\nforget the follies and vices of other so soon as I ought, nor  their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed\n\nabout with every attempt to move them. My temper would\n\nperhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost\n\nforever.\"\n \n\"THAT is a failing indeed!\" cried Elizabeth. \"Implacable\n\nresentment IS a shade in a character. But you have chosen\n\nyour fault well. I really cannot LAUGH at it. You are safe\n\nfrom me.\"\n \n\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to\n\nsome particular evil--a natural defect, which not even the best\n\neducation can overcome.\"\n \n\"And YOUR defect is to hate everybody.\"\n\n\"And yours,\" he replied with a smile, \"is willfully to\n\nmisunderstand them.\"\n \n\"Do let us have a little music,\" cried Miss Bingley, tired of  a conversation in which she had no share. \"Louisa, you will  not mind my waking Mr. Hurst?\"\n\nHer sister had not the smallest objection, and the piano\n\nforte was opened; and Darcy, after a few moments'  recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to feel the danger  of paying Elizabeth too much attention.\n\n\n\nChapter 12.\n\nIn consequence of an agreement between the sisters,  Elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day.\n\nBut Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters\n\nremaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which  would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to  receive them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was\n\nnot propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was\n\nimpatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they  could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in  her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister\n\npressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.\n\nAgainst staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding\n\nthemselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr.\n\nBingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.\n\nThe communication excited many professions of concern;\n\nand enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the  following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going  was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had\n\nproposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister\n\nmuch exceeded her affection for the other.\n\n\n\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss\n\nBennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not\n\nenough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to\n\nbe right.\n\nTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had\n\nbeen at Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than\n\nhe liked--and Miss Bingley was uncivil to HER, and more  teasing than usual to himself. He wisely resolved to be  particularly careful that no sign of admiration should NOW\n\nescape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of\n\ninfluencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been  suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have  material weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his\n\npurpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole\n\nof Saturday, and though they were at one time left by  themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously\n\nto his book, and would not even look at her.\n \nOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so\n\nagreeable to almost all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to  Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her  affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the\n\nlatter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either\n\nat Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most  tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth  took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.\n\n\n\nThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought\n\nthem very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane\n\nwould have caught cold again. But their father, though very  laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see  them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The\n\nevening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost\n\nmuch of its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence\n\nof Jane and Elizabeth.\n \nThey found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-\n\nbass and human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and\n\nsome new observations of threadbare morality to listen to.  Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different\n\nsort. Much had been done and much had been said in the\n\nregiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the\n\nofficers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been  flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster  was going to be married.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 13.\n\n\"I hope, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they  were at breakfast the next morning, \"that you have ordered a  good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an\n\naddition to our family party.\"\n\n\"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is  coming, I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to  call in--and I hope MY dinners are good enough for her. I do\n\nnot believe she often sees such at home.\"\n \n\"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a\n\nstranger.\"\n\nMrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. \"A gentleman and a stranger!\n\nIt is Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be\n\nextremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. But--good Lord! how  unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my  love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this moment.\"\n\n\"It is NOT Mr. Bingley,\" said her husband; \"it is a person\n\nwhom I never saw in the whole course of my life.\"\n\nThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five\n\ndaughters at once.\n\n\n\nAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he\n\nthus explained:\n\n\"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a\n\nfortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some  delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin,  Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of\n\nthis house as soon as he pleases.\"\n\n\"Oh! my dear,\" cried his wife, \"I cannot bear to hear that  mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is  the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be\n\nentailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had\n\nbeen you, I should have tried long ago to do something or\n\nother about it.\"\n \nJane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an\n\nentail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a\n\nsubject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason,  and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling  an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a\n\nman whom nobody cared anything about.\n\n\"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\" said Mr. Bennet,  \"and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting  Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may\n\nperhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing\n\nhimself.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very\n\nimpertinent of him to write to you at all, and very\n\nhypocritical. I hate such false friends. Why could he not keep\n\non quarreling with you, as his father did before him?\"\n\n\"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial\n\nscruples on that head, as you will hear.\"\n\n\"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.\n\n\"Dear Sir,-\n \n\"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my\n\nlate honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and\n\nsince I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently\n\nwished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back  by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to  his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with\n\nwhom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--'There,\n\nMrs. Bennet.'--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the\n\nRight Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir\n\nLewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful\n\nrespect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform\n\nthose rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church  of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to\n\n\n\npromote and establish the blessing of peace in all families  within in the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I\n\nflatter myself that my present overtures are highly\n\ncommendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in  the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on  your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch.\n\nI cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of\n\ninjuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise  for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them  every possible amends--but of this hereafter. If you should\n\nhave no objection to receive me into your house, I propose\n\nmyself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family,  Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and shall probably  trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday night following,\n\nwhich I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine\n\nis far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday,  provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty  of the day.--I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to\n\nyour lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,\n\n\"WILLIAM COLLINS\"\n \n\"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peacemaking gentleman,\" said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the\n\nletter. \"He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young\n\nman, upon my word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable  acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so  indulgent as to let him come to us again.\"\n\n\n\n\"There is some sense in what he says about the girls,\n\nhowever, and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I\n\nshall not be the person to discourage him.\"\n\n\"Though it is difficult,\" said Jane, \"to guess in what way he\n\ncan mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the\n\nwish is certainly to his credit.\"\n\nElizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference\n\nfor Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening,  marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were  required.\n\n\"He must be an oddity, I think,\" said she. \"I cannot make\n\nhim out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And  what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?We cannot suppose he would help it if he could.--Could he be\n\na sensible man, sir?\"\n\n\"No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding  him quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his letter, which promises well. I am impatient\n\nto see him.\"\n \n\"In point of composition,\" said Mary, \"the letter does not  seem defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not  wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed.\"\n\n\n\nTo Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that\n\ntheir cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now\n\nsome weeks since they had received pleasure from the society  of a man in any other colour. As for their mother, Mr.  Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she\n\nwas preparing to see him with a degree of composure which\n\nastonished her husband and daughters.\n\nMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed\n\nsaid little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr.\n\nCollins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of fiveand-twenty. His air was grave and stately,\n\nand his manners were very formal. He had not been long\n\nseated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine  a family of daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty,\n\nbut that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and\n\nadded, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time\n\ndisposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the  taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled  with no compliments, answered most readily.\n\n\"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart\n\nit may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things\n\nare settled so oddly.\"\n\n\n\n\"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\"\n\n\"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor\n\ngirls, you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with\n\nYOU, for such things I know are all chance in this world.  There is no knowing how estates will go when once they\n\ncome to be entailed.\"\n \n\"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair\n\ncousins, and could say much on the subject, but that I am  cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can  assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them.\n\nAt present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are\n\nbetter acquainted--\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr.\n\nCollins's admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its\n\nfurniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation  of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's heart, but for  the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own\n\nfuture property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired;\n\nand he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the  excellency of its cooking was owing. But he was set right  there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some asperity\n\nthat they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that\n\nher daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged  pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she\n\n\n\ndeclared herself not at all offended; but he continued to\n\napologise for about a quarter of an hour.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 14.\n\nDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in\n\nwhich he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed\n\nvery fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh's\n\nattention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort,\n\nappeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\n\nbetter. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject\n\nelevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and  with a most important aspect he protested that \"he had never  in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such\n\naffability and condescension, as he had himself experienced\n\nfrom Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to  approve of both of the discourses which he had already had  the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him\n\ntwice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the\n\nSaturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but HE had never seen anything but affability in her.\n\nShe had always spoken to him as she would to any other\n\ngentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining  in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the  parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations.\n\nShe had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as\n\nhe could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once  paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had\n\n\n\nperfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and  had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself--some shelves in\n\nthe closet upstairs.\"\n\n\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs.  Bennet, \"and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a  pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does\n\nshe live near you, sir?\"\n\n\"The garden in which stands my humble abode is\n\nseparated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's\n\nresidence.\"\n \n\"I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any\n\nfamily?\"\n\n\"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of\n\nvery extensive property.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \"then she is\n\nbetter off than many girls. And what sort of young lady is\n\nshe? Is she handsome?\"\n \n\"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady\n\nCatherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de\n\nBourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly\n\nconstitution, which has prevented her from making that\n\n\n\nprogress in many accomplishments which she could not have  otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who\n\nsuperintended her education, and who still resides with them.\n\nBut she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"\n\n\"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name\n\namong the ladies at court.\"\n\n\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her  being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine  one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest\n\nornaments. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and\n\nyou may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer  those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable  to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine,\n\nthat her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and\n\nthat the most elevated rank, instead of giving her  consequence, would be adorned by her. These are the kind of  little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of\n\nattention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.\"\n\n\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and it is  happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with  delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed\n\nfrom the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous\n\nstudy?\"\n\n\n\n\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and\n\nthough I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and\n\narranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted\n\nto ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied\n\nan air as possible.\"\n\nMr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin\n\nwas as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the\n\nkeenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most  resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an  occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his\n\npleasure.\n\nBy tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr.  Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read\n\naloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book\n\nwas produced; but, on beholding it (for everything announced  it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and  begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty\n\nstared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were\n\nproduced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's  Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he  had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she\n\ninterrupted him with:\n\n\"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of\n\nturning away Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will\n\n\n\nhire him. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk  to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when\n\nMr. Denny comes back from town.\"\n\nLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue;\n\nbut Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:\n \n\"I have often observed how little young ladies are\n\ninterested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely\n\nfor their benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there  can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I  will no longer importune my young cousin.\"\n\nThen turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his\n\nantagonist at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the  challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the  girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her\n\ndaughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and\n\npromised that it should not occur again, if he would resume  his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his  young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her\n\nbehaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with\n\nMr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.\n\n\n\nChapter 15.\n\nMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance\n\nof an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to\n\none of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary  terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The  subjection in which his father had brought him up had given\n\nhim originally great humility of manner; but it was now a\n\ngood deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head,  living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early  and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had\n\nrecommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the\n\nliving of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt\n\nfor her high rank,\n\nand his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a\n\nvery good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman,\n\nand his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\n\npride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.\n\nHaving now a good house and a very sufficient income, he\n\nintended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the\n\nLongbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. This\n\nwas his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their\n\nfather's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of\n\n\n\neligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and\n\ndisinterested on his own part.\n\nHis plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely\n\nface confirmed his views, and established all his strictest\n\nnotions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening  SHE was his settled choice. The next morning, however,\n\nmade an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete\n\nwith Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning  with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal  of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at\n\nLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles\n\nand general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he  had fixed on. \"As to her YOUNGER daughters, she could not  take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she\n\ndid not KNOW of any prepossession; her ELDEST daughter,\n\nshe must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint,\n\nwas likely to be very soon engaged.\"\n\nMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth-and\n\nit was soon done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the\n\nfire. Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty,\n\nsucceeded her of course.\n \nMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she\n\nmight soon have two daughters married; and the man whom\n\nshe could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in\n\nher good graces.\n\n\n\nLydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr.\n\nCollins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who\n\nwas most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to\n\nhimself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after\n\nbreakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged\n\nwith one of the largest folios in the collection, but really\n\ntalking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and  garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet  exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure\n\nand tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to\n\nmeet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house,  he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,  was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters\n\nin their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted\n\nfor a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his\n\nlarge book, and go.\n\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that\n\nof his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The\n\nattention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained  by him. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the  street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very\n\nsmart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop\n\nwindow, could recall them.\n \nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most\n\n\n\ngentlemanlike appearance, walking with another officer on the  other side of the way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny\n\nconcerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire,\n\nand he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the  stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and  Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across\n\nthe street, under pretense of wanting something in an opposite\n\nshop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the  two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot. Mr.  Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to\n\nintroduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with\n\nhim the day before from town, and he was happy to say had  accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it  should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to\n\nmake him completely charming. His appearance was greatly\n\nin his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine  countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The  introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness\n\nof conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct\n\nand unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and  talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses  drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding\n\ndown the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the\n\ntwo gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the  usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and  Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his\n\nway to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy\n\ncorroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine\n\n\n\nnot to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly  arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening\n\nto see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,\n\nwas all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both  changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr.\n\nWickham, after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation\n\nwhich Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the\n\nmeaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible\n\nnot to long to know.\n\nIn another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to\n\nhave noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his\n\nfriend.\n \nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their\n\nbows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they\n\nshould come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips's throwing\n\nup the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation.\n\nMrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the\n\ntwo eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly\n\nwelcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their  sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not  fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she\n\nhad not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the street,\n\nwho had told her that they were not to send any more draughts  to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away,\n\n\n\nwhen her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's  introduction of him. She received him with her very best\n\npoliteness, which he returned with as much more, apologising\n\nfor his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her,  which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be  justified by his relationship to the young ladies who\n\nintroduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by\n\nsuch an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one  stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries  about the other; of whom, however, she could only tell her\n\nnieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought\n\nhim from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's\n\ncommission in the ---shire. She had been watching him the  last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and\n\nhad Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly\n\nhave continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed  windows now except a few of the officers, who, in  comparison with the stranger, were become \"stupid,\n\ndisagreeable fellows.\" Some of them were to dine with the\n\nPhillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the\n\nevening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested that\n\nthey would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery  tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect  of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual\n\ngood spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the\n\n\n\nroom, and was assured with unwearying civility that they\n\nwere perfectly needless.\n\nAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she\n\nhad seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane  would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be  in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than\n\nher sister.\n \nMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never\n\nseen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received\n\nhim with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him  in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly  unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be\n\nattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never\n\nmet with so much attention in the whole course of his life.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 16.\n\nAs no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his\n\nvisit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and\n\nhis five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls  had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,  that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and\n\nwas then in the house.\n \nWhen this information was given, and they had all taken\n\ntheir seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and\n\nadmire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture\n\nof the apartment, that he declared he might almost have\n\nsupposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at  Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much  gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him\n\nwhat Rosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had\n\nlistened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's  drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had  cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the\n\ncompliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\n\nwith the housekeeper's room.\n\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own\n\nhumble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was\n\nhappily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he\n\n\n\nfound in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion  of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who\n\nwas resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as\n\nshe could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,  and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and\n\nexamine their own indifferent imitations of china on the\n\nmantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was\n\nover at last, however. The gentlemen did approach, and when\n\nMr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she\n\nhad neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since,\n\nwith the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The\n\nofficers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,  gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present  party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person,\n\ncountenance, air, and walk, as THEY were superior to the\n\nbroad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who\n\nfollowed them into the room.\n \nMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost\n\nevery female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy\n\nwoman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable  manner in which he immediately fell into conversation,  though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel that\n\nthe commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be\n\nrendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.\n\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham\n\nand the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into\n\n\n\ninsignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing;  but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and\n\nwas by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with\n\ncoffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he had  the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to\n\nwhist.\n \n\"I know little of the game at present,\" said he, \"but I shall\n\nbe glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life--\" Mrs.  Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait\n\nfor his reason.\n \nMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight\n\nwas he received at the other table between Elizabeth and\n\nLydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being\n\nlikewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too\n\nmuch interested in the game, too eager in making bets and  exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in  particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game,\n\nMr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and\n\nshe was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly  wished to hear she could not hope to be told--the history of  his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention\n\nthat gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\n\nrelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired  how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving\n\n\n\nher answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy\n\nhad been staying there.\n\n\"About a month,\" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let\n\nthe subject drop, added, \"He is a man of very large property in\n\nDerbyshire, I understand.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Wickham; \"his estate there is a noble\n\none. A clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met\n\nwith a person more capable of giving you certain information  on that head than myself, for I have been connected with his  family in a particular manner from my infancy.\"\n\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\n\n\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an  assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold  manner of our meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted\n\nwith Mr. Darcy?\"\n\n\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth very  warmly. \"I have spent four days in the same house with him,  and I think him very disagreeable.\"\n\n\"I have no right to give MY opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as\n\nto his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form  one. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair  judge. It is impossible for ME to be impartial. But I believe\n\nyour opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps\n\n\n\nyou would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.\n\nHere you are in your own family.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I say no more HERE than I might say in\n\nany house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not  at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his  pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by\n\nanyone.\"\n\n\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short  interruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated  beyond their deserts; but with HIM I believe it does not often\n\nhappen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence,\n\nor frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him\n\nonly as he chooses to be seen.\"\n\n\"I should take him, even on MY slight acquaintance, to be\n\nan ill-tempered man.\" Wickham only shook his head.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,\n\n\"whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.\"\n\n\"I do not at all know; but I HEARD nothing of his going\n\naway when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour\n\nof the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the\n\nneighbourhood.\"\n\n\"Oh! no--it is not for ME to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.\n\nIf HE wishes to avoid seeing ME, he must go. We are not on\n\n\n\nfriendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I  have no reason for avoiding HIM but what I might proclaim\n\nbefore all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most\n\npainful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss  Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever\n\nbreathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be\n\nin company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the\n\nsoul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to  myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could  forgive him anything and everything, rather than his\n\ndisappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his\n\nfather.\"\n \nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented\n\nfurther inquiry.\n\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics,  Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter\n\nwith gentle but very intelligible gallantry.\n\n\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\"  he added, \"which was my chief inducement to enter the --shire. I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and\n\nmy friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their\n\npresent quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent  acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is\n\n\n\nnecessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my  spirits will not bear solitude. I MUST have employment and\n\nsociety. A military life is not what I was intended for, but\n\ncircumstances have now made it eligible. The church OUGHT  to have been my profession--I was brought up for the church,  and I should at this time have been in possession of a most\n\nvaluable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were\n\nspeaking of just now.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n \n\"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next\n\npresentation of the best living in his gift. He was my\n\ngodfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice  to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply, and  thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\n\nelsewhere.\"\n \n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could THAT\n\nbe? How could his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek\n\nlegal redress?\"\n\n\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the\n\nbequest as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour  could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to  doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional\n\nrecommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to\n\nit by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing.  Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago,\n\n\n\nexactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to\n\nanother man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse\n\nmyself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. I\n\nhave a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have spoken my  opinion OF him, and TO him, too freely. I can recall nothing  worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men,\n\nand that he hates me.\"\n \n\"This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly\n\ndisgraced.\"\n\n\"Some time or other he WILL be--but it shall not be by\n\nME. Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose\n\nHIM.\"\n \nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him\n\nhandsomer than ever as he expressed them.\n\n\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his\n\nmotive? What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\n\n\"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I\n\ncannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late\n\nMr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me\n\nbetter; but his father's uncommon attachment to me irritated\n\nhim, I believe, very early in life. He had not a temper to bear  the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of\n\npreference which was often given me.\"\n\n\n\n\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have\n\nnever liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had\n\nsupposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general,\n\nbut did not suspect him of descending to such malicious\n\nrevenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this.\"\n\nAfter a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, \"I\n\nDO remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the\n\nimplacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving\n\ntemper. His disposition must be dreadful.\"\n\n\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham;\n\n\"I can hardly be just to him.\"\n\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \"To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!\" She could have added, \"A young\n\nman, too, like YOU, whose very countenance may vouch for\n\nyour being amiable\"--but she contented herself with, \"and  one, too, who had probably been his companion from  childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the\n\nclosest manner!\"\n \n\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park;  the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of  the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the\n\nsame parental care. MY father began life in the profession\n\nwhich your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit  to--but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr.\n\n\n\nDarcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\n\nintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged\n\nhimself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's  active superintendence, and when, immediately before my  father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of\n\nproviding for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much\n\na debt of gratitude to HIM, as of his affection to myself.\"\n\n\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth. \"How abominable! I\n\nwonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made\n\nhim just to you! If from no better motive, that he should not\n\nhave been too proud to be dishonest--for dishonesty I must\n\ncall it.\"\n \n\"It IS wonderful,\" replied Wickham, \"for almost all his\n\nactions may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his\n\nbest friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than with\n\nany other feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in his  behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than\n\npride.\"\n\n\"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him\n\ngood?\"\n\n\"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to\n\ngive his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his\n\ntenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and FILIAL pride-for he is very proud of what his father was--have done this.\n\n\n\nNot to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley\n\nHouse, is a powerful motive. He has also BROTHERLY\n\npride, which, with SOME brotherly affection, makes him a  very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear  him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of\n\nbrothers.\"\n \n\"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"I wish I could call her amiable. It\n\ngives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like\n\nher brother--very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate\n\nand pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted  hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me  now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I\n\nunderstand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, her\n\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and\n\nsuperintends her education.\"\n\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects,\n\nElizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and\n\nsaying:\n\n\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How\n\ncan Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I\n\nreally believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a\n\nman? How can they suit each other? Do you know Mr.\n\nBingley?\"\n\n\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n \n\"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He\n\ncannot know what Mr. Darcy is.\"\n\n\"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.\n\nHe does not want abilities. He can be a conversible\n\ncompanion if he thinks it worth his while. Among those who\n\nare at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man\n\nfrom what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never deserts  him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere,  rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing\n\nsomething for fortune and figure.\"\n\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual\n\ninquiries as to his success was made by the latter. It had not\n\nbeen very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs.  Phillips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured  her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least\n\nimportance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and\n\nbegged that she would not make herself uneasy.\n\n\"I know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit\n\ndown to a card-table, they must take their chances of these\n\nthings, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make\n\nfive shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who  could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de\n\n\n\nBourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\n\nlittle matters.\"\n \nMr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing\n\nMr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low\n\nvoice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted\n\nwith the family of de Bourgh.\n\n\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately\n\ngiven him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first  introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her  long.\"\n\n\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and\n\nLady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\"\n\n\"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady\n\nCatherine's connections. I never heard of her existence till the\n\nday before yesterday.\"\n\n\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large\n\nfortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite\n\nthe two estates.\"\n \nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of\n\nhimself, if he were already self-destined for another.\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady\n\nCatherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he\n\nhas related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads\n\nhim, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an\n\narrogant, conceited woman.\"\n\n\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied\n\nWickham; \"I have not seen her for many years, but I very well\n\nremember that I never liked her, and that her manners were\n\ndictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being  remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she\n\nderives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part\n\nfrom her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for  her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him  should have an understanding of the first class.\"\n\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account\n\nof it, and they continued talking together, with mutual  satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of\n\nthe ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions. There\n\ncould be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips's supper\n\nparty, but his manners recommended him to everybody.\n\nWhatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done\n\ngracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.\n\nShe could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what\n\nhe had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for  her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia  nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked incessantly of\n\n\n\nlottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had  won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and\n\nMrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his\n\nlosses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and  repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to  say than he could well man age before the carriage stopped at\n\nLongbourn House.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 17.\n\nElizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed\n\nbetween Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with\n\nastonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that\n\nMr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard; and\n\nyet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young  man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The possibility  of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to interest\n\nall her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be\n\ndone, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of\n\neach, and throw into the account of accident or mistake\n\nwhatever could not be otherwise explained.\n\n\"They have both,\" said she, \"been deceived, I dare say, in\n\nsome way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested  people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in  short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or\n\ncircumstances which may have alienated them, without actual\n\nblame on either side.\"\n \n\"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you\n\ngot to say on behalf of the interested people who have\n\nprobably been concerned in the business? Do clear THEM\n\ntoo, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.\"\n\n\"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me\n\nout of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what\n\na disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his\n\n\n\nfather's favourite in such a manner, one whom his father had\n\npromised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common\n\nhumanity, no man who had any value for his character, could\n\nbe capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so\n\nexcessively deceived in him? Oh! no.\"\n\n\"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being\n\nimposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a\n\nhistory of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts,  everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let  Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.\"\n\n\"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know\n\nwhat to think.\"\n \n\"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\"\n\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point-that\n\nMr. Bingley, if he HAD been imposed on, would have much\n\nto suffer when the affair became public.\n\nThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very\n\npersons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his\n\nsisters came to give their personal invitation for the longexpected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the  following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their\n\ndear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\n\nrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since\n\n\n\ntheir separation. To the rest of the family they paid little  attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying\n\nnot much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They\n\nwere soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity  which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if  eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.\n\nThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely\n\nagreeable to every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to  consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and  was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr.\n\nBingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured\n\nto herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends,  and the attentions of her brother; and Elizabeth thought with  pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of\n\nseeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look and\n\nbehavior. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia  depended less on any single event, or any particular person,  for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the\n\nevening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only\n\npartner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a  ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she had no\n\ndisinclination for it.\n \n\"While I can have my mornings to myself,\" said she, \"it is\n\nenough--I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in  evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I\n\n\n\nprofess myself one of those who consider intervals of\n\nrecreation and amusement as desirable for everybody.\"\n\nElizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that\n\nthough she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins,  she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept  Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think\n\nit proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was\n\nrather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple  whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a  rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de\n\nBourgh, by venturing to dance.\n\n\"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,\" said he,  \"that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to  respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so\n\nfar from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be\n\nhonoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of  the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours,  Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a\n\npreference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the\n\nright cause, and not to any disrespect for her.\"\n\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very\n\ndances; and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had\n\nnever been worse timed. There was no help for it, however.  Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforce delayed\n\n\n\na little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as  good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with\n\nhis gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It\n\nnow first struck her, that SHE was selected from among her  sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage,  and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the\n\nabsence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to\n\nconviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward  herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her  wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified\n\nherself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her\n\nmother gave her to understand that the probability of their  marriage was extremely agreeable to HER. Elizabeth,  however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware\n\nthat a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply.\n\nMr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\n\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and\n\ntalk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very\n\npitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to  the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as  prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no\n\nofficers, no news could be sought after--the very shoe-roses\n\nfor Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have  found some trial of her patience in weather which totally  suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr.\n\nWickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could\n\n\n\nhave made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday\n\nendurable to Kitty and Lydia.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 18.\n\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never\n\noccurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been\n\nchecked by any of those recollections that might not  unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more  than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the\n\nconquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting\n\nthat it was not more than might be won in the course of the  evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his  being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the\n\nBingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not\n\nexactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was  pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly  applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to\n\ngo to town on business the day before, and was not yet\n\nreturned; adding, with a significant smile, \"I do not imagine  his business would have called him away just now, if he had  not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.\"\n\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was\n\ncaught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not\n\nless answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first\n\nsurmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the\n\nformer was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that\n\nshe could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite in\n\n\n\nquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.  Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to\n\nWickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation\n\nwith him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which  she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr.  Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.\n\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though\n\nevery prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it  could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her  griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week,\n\nshe was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the\n\noddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular  notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of  distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins,\n\nawkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and\n\noften moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all  the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a  couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from\n\nhim was ecstasy.\n\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment\n\nof talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally\n\nliked. When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte\n\nLucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found\n\nherself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so  much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without  knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away\n\n\n\nagain immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want\n\nof presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her:\n\n\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid! THAT would be the greatest misfortune\n\nof all! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to\n\nhate! Do not wish me such an evil.\"\n \nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy\n\napproached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help  cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow  her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the\n\neyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\n\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to  which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to  Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks, their equal\n\namazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without\n\nspeaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence  was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved  not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the\n\ngreater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she\n\nmade some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and  was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she  addressed him a second time with:--\"It is YOUR turn to say\n\nsomething now, Mr. Darcy. I talked about the dance, and\n\nYOU ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.\"\n\n\n\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him\n\nto say should be said.\n\n\"Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by\n\nand by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter\n\nthan public ones. But NOW we may be silent.\"\n\n\"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\"\n\n\"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would\n\nlook odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet  for the advantage of SOME, conversation ought to be so  arranged, as that they may have the trouble of saying as little\n\nas possible.\"\n\n\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case,\n\nor do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\n\n\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a\n\ngreat similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an\n\nunsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we  expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and  be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\n\n\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own\n\ncharacter, I am sure,\" said he. \"How near it may be to MINE,  I cannot pretend to say. YOU think it a faithful portrait  undoubtedly.\"\n\n\n\n\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\n\nHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they\n\nhad gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her\n\nsisters did not very often walk to Meryton. She answered in  the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added,  \"When you met us there the other day, we had just been\n\nforming a new acquaintance.\"\n\nThe effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go\n\non. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,\n\n\"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may  ensure his MAKING friends--whether he may be equally  capable of RETAINING them, is less certain.\"\n\n\"He has been so unlucky as to lose YOUR friendship,\"\n\nreplied Elizabeth with emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is\n\nlikely to suffer from all his life.\"\n\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing\n\nthe subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared\n\nclose to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other  side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped  with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his\n\ndancing and his partner.\n\n\n\n\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.\n\nSuch very superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that\n\nyou belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that\n\nyour fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope  to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain  desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and\n\nBingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow\n\nin! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir.  You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching  converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also up\n\nbraiding me.\"\n\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy;\n\nbut Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him\n\nforcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious\n\nexpression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing\n\ntogether. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to  his partner, and said, \"Sir William's interruption has made me  forget what we were talking of.\"\n\n\"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could\n\nnot have interrupted two people in the room who had less to  say for themselves. We have tried two or three subjects  already without success, and what we are to talk of next I\n\ncannot imagine.\"\n\n\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\n\n\n\n\"Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not\n\nwith the same feelings.\"\n\n\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can\n\nat least be no want of subject. We may compare our different\n\nopinions.\"\n\n\"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is\n\nalways full of something else.\"\n\n\"The PRESENT always occupies you in such scenes--does\n\nit?\" said he, with a look of doubt.\n \n\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said,\n\nfor her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon\n\nafterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember  hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever  forgave, that you resentment once created was unappeasable.\n\nYou are very cautious, I suppose, as to its BEING\n\nCREATED.\"\n \n\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\n \n\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\n\n\"I hope not.\"\n\n\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change\n\ntheir opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.\"\n\n\n\n\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\n\n\"Merely to the illustration of YOUR character,\" said she,\n\nendeavouring to shake off her gravity. \"I am trying to make it\n\nout.\"\n \n\"And what is your success?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I do not get on at all. I hear such\n\ndifferent accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\n\n\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that reports  may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss  Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the\n\npresent moment, as there is reason to fear that the\n\nperformance would reflect no credit on either.\"\n\n\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have\n\nanother opportunity.\"\n\n\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he\n\ncoldly replied. She said no more, and they went down the  other dance and parted in silence; and on each side  dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's\n\nbreast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,\n\nwhich soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger\n\nagainst another.\n\n\n\nThey had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted\n\nher:\n \n\"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George  Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and  asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man\n\nquite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that\n\nhe was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward.  Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give  implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's\n\nusing him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has\n\nalways been remarkably kind to him, though George  Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I  do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr.\n\nDarcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear\n\nGeorge Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that\n\nhe had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the\n\ncountry at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder  how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this  discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really, considering his\n\ndescent, one could not expect much better.\"\n\n\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the  same,\" said Elizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse  him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's\n\n\n\nsteward, and of THAT, I can assure you, he informed me\n\nhimself.\"\n \n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away\n\nwith a sneer. \"Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.\"\n\n\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself. \"You are much\n\nmistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack\n\nas this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and\n\nthe malice of Mr. Darcy.\" She then sought her eldest sister,  who has undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of  Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet\n\ncomplacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\n\nmarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the\n\nevening. Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that  moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his\n\nenemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of\n\nJane's being in the fairest way for happiness.\n\n\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less\n\nsmiling than her sister's, \"what you have learnt about Mr.\n\nWickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged\n\nto think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of\n\nmy pardon.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have\n\nnothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know\n\nthe whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circum stances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he\n\n\n\nwill vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of  his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has\n\ndeserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\n\nreceived; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his  sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young  man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has\n\ndeserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"\n\n\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\n\n\"This account then is what he has received from Mr.\n\nDarcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\"\n\n\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though  he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he  believes that it was left to him CONDITIONALLY only.\"\n\n\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,\" said\n\nElizabeth warmly; \"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr. Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is\n\nunacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the\n\nrest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of\n\nboth gentlemen as I did before.\"\n\nShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to\n\neach, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment.\n\n\n\nElizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley's regard, and\n\nsaid all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their\n\nbeing joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to  Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last  partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up\n\nto them, and told her with great exultation that he had just\n\nbeen so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.\n\n\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that\n\nthere is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I\n\nhappened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the\n\nyoung lady who does the honours of the house the names of  his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.  How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have\n\nthought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady\n\nCatherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my\n\nnot having done it before. My total ignorance of the\n\nconnection must plead my apology.\"\n\n\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\"\n\n\"Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done\n\nit earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine's NEPHEW. It\n\nwill be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite\n\nwell yesterday se'nnight.\"\n\n\n\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme,\n\nassuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing\n\nhim without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather\n\nthan a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least  necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that if  it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\n\nconsequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened\n\nto her with the determined air of following his own\n\ninclination, and, when she ceased speaking, replied thus:\n\n\"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the\n\nworld in your excellent judgement in all matters within the\n\nscope of your understanding; but permit me to say, that there\n\nmust be a wide difference between the established forms of\n\nceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the\n\nclergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the\n\nclerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest  rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of\n\nbehaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore\n\nallow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this\n\noccasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point  of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice,  which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,\n\nthough in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by\n\neducation and habitual study to decide on what is right than a  young lady like yourself.\" And with a low bow he left her to  attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly\n\nwatched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was\n\n\n\nvery evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn  bow and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if\n\nhearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words\n\n\"apology,\" \"Hunsford,\" and \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\" It  vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy  was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last\n\nMr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of\n\ndistant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged  from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed  abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech,\n\nand at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved\n\nanother way. Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.\n\n\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied\n\nwith my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the\n\nattention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even\n\npaid me the compliment of saying that he was so well  convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain  she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a\n\nvery handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased\n\nwith him.\"\n \nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister\n\nand Mr. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which\n\nher observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as  happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house,  in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could\n\n\n\nbestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of  endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's\n\nthoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she\n\ndetermined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too  much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she  considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them\n\nwithin one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find\n\nthat her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas)  freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that  Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an\n\nanimating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of\n\nfatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His  being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but  three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;\n\nand then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two\n\nsisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the\n\nconnection as much as she could do. It\n \nwas, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\n\ndaughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in\n\nthe way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her  time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the  care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into\n\ncompany more than she liked. It was necessary to make this\n\ncircumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions  it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet  to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She\n\nconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might\n\n\n\nsoon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly\n\nbelieving there was no chance of it.\n\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of\n\nher mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in  a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she  could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr.\n\nDarcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her\n\nfor being nonsensical.\n\n\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of\n\nhim? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be\n\nobliged to say nothing HE may not like to hear.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage  can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never  recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!\"\n\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence.\n\nHer mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at\n\nMr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she\n\ndreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother,  she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by  her. The expression of his face changed gradually from\n\nindignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.\n\n\n\nAt length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and\n\nLady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of\n\ndelights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to\n\nthe comforts of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to  revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when  supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the\n\nmortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\n\npreparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks  and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a  proof of complaisance, but in vain; Mary would not\n\nunderstand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was\n\ndelightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's eyes  were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she  watched her progress through the several stanzas with an\n\nimpatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for\n\nMary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary's powers\n\nwere by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was\n\nweak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She  looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very  composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters,\n\nand saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at\n\nDarcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint, and when Mary\n\nhad finished her second song, said aloud, \"That will do\n\n\n\nextremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let\n\nthe other young ladies have time to exhibit.\"\n\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat\n\ndisconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her  father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.  Others of the party were now applied to.\n\n\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to\n\nsing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the  company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent  diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a\n\nclergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be\n\njustified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there  are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a  parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such\n\nan agreement for tithes as a may be beneficial to himself and\n\nnot offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons;  and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish  duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which\n\nhe cannot be excused from making as a comfortable as\n\npossible.\n\nAnd I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manner towards everybody,\n\nespecially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I\n\ncannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the  man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect\n\n\n\ntowards anybody connected with the family.\" And with a bow  to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been\n\nspoken so loud as a to be heard by half the room. Many\n\nstared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than  Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr.  Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-\n\nwhisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good\n\nkind of young man.\n\nTo Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as a much as a they could\n\nduring the evening, it would have been impossible for them to\n\nplay their parts with more spirit or finer success; and happy  did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the  exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were\n\nnot of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must\n\nhave witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however,  should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations,  was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the\n\nsilent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the\n\nladies, were more intolerable.\n \nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly\n\nby her side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance\n\nwith him again, put it out of her power to dance with others.  In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else,  and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He\n\n\n\nassured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to  it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to\n\nrecommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a\n\npoint of remaining close to her the whole evening. There was  no arguing upon such a project. She owed her greatest relief to  her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and\n\ngoodnaturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.\n\nShe was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough\n\nto speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her\n\nallusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.\n\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for\n\ntheir carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was\n\ngone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were  wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister  scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue,\n\nand were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.\n\nThey repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins,\n\nwho was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the\n\nelegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and  politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.  Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was\n\n\n\nenjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing  together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to\n\neach other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either\n\nMrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of  \"Lord, how tired I am!\" accompanied by a violent yawn.\n\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was\n\nmost pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family  soon at Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr.  Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by\n\neating a family dinner with them at any time, without the\n\nceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful  pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest  opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London,\n\nwhither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.\n\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and\n\nwedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter\n\nsettled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of\n\nhaving another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought  with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal,\n\npleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her\n\nchildren; and though the man and the match were quite good  enough for HER, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr.  Bingley and Netherfield.\n\n\n\nChapter 19.\n\nThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr.  Collins made his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to\n\nthe following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence\n\nto make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set  about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances,  which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding\n\nMrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,\n\nsoon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:\n \n\"May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair\n\ndaughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private\n\naudience with her in the course of this morning?\"\n\nBefore Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, \"Oh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure she\n\ncan have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.\"\n\nAnd, gathering her work together, she was hastening away,\n\nwhen Elizabeth called out:\n \n\"Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr.\n\nCollins must excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me\n\nthat anybody need not hear. I am going away myself.\"\n\n\"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you\n\nare.\" And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and\n\n\n\nembarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: \"Lizzy, I\n\nINSIST upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.\"\n\nElizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a\n\nmoment's consideration making her also sensible that it would  be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she  sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment\n\nthe feelings which were divided between distress and\n\ndiversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as\n\nthey were gone, Mr. Collins began.\n\n\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty,\n\nso far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other\n\nperfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes  had there NOT been this little unwillingness; but allow me to  assure you, that I have your respected mother's permission for\n\nthis address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my\n\ndiscourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to  dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be  mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you\n\nout as the companion of my future life. But before I am run\n\naway with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it would be  advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and,  moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of\n\nselecting a wife, as I certainly did.\"\n\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near\n\n\n\nlaughing, that she could not use the short pause he allowed in\n\nany attempt to stop him further, and he continued:\n\n\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right\n\nthing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself )  to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I  am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness;\n\nand thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier,\n\nthat it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very  noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.  Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\n\ntoo!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night\n\nbefore I left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while  Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that  she said, 'Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you\n\nmust marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for MY\n\nsake; and for your OWN, let her be an active, useful sort of  person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income  go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon\n\nas you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow\n\nme, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not  reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh  as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.\n\nYou will find her manners beyond anything I can describe;\n\nand your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her,  especially when tempered with the silence and respect which  her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\n\nintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why\n\n\n\nmy views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my  own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many\n\namiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to\n\ninherit this estate after the death of your honoured father  (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not  satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among\n\nhis daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as\n\npossible, when the melancholy event takes place--which,  however, as I have already said, may not be for several years.  This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself\n\nit will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains\n\nbut for me but to assure you in the most animated language of  the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly  indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your\n\nfather, since I am well aware that it could not be complied\n\nwith; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents,  which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all  that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I\n\nshall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no\n\nungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are\n\nmarried.\"\n \nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\n\n\"You are too hasty, sir,\" she cried. \"You forget that I have\n\nmade no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time.\n\nAccept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I\n\n\n\nam very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is\n\nimpossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them.\"\n\n\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal\n\nwave of the hand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject  the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept,  when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the\n\nrefusal is repeated a second, or even a third time. I am\n\ntherefore by no means discouraged by what you have just\n\nsaid, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is a\n\nrather extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you\n\nthat I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies  there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the  chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in\n\nmy refusal. You could not make ME happy, and I am\n\nconvinced that I am the last woman in the world who could\n\nmake you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know  me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill\n\nqualified for the situation.\"\n\n\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said  Mr. Collins very gravely--\"but I cannot imagine that her  ladyship would at all disapprove of you. And you may be\n\ncertain when I have the honour of seeing her again, I shall\n\nspeak in the very highest terms of your modesty, economy,\n\nand other amiable qualification.\"\n\n\n\n\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.\n\nYou must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the\n\ncompliment of believing what I say. I wish you very happy\n\nand very rich, and by refusing you hand, do all in my power to  prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you  must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard\n\nto my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate\n\nwhenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may  be considered, therefore, as finally settled.\" And rising as she  thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins\n\nnot thus addressed her:\n \n\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on  the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer  than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing\n\nyou of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the\n\nestablished custom of your sex to reject a man on the first  application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to  encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true\n\ndelicacy of the female character.\"\n\n\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth,  \"you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can  appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how\n\nto express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its\n\nbeing one.\"\n\n\n\n\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin,\n\nthat your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.\n\nMy reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not\n\nappear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or  that the establishment I can offer would be any other than  highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the\n\nfamily of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\n\ncircumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it  into further consideration, that in spite of your manifold  attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of\n\nmarriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so\n\nsmall that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your  loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore  conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I\n\nshall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love\n\nby suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant\n\nfemales.\"\n \n\"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to\n\nthat kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a\n\nrespectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of  being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for the  honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept\n\nthem is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\n\nforbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an  elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational  creature, speaking the truth from her heart.\"\n\n\n\n\"You are uniformly charming!\" cried he, with an air of\n\nawkward gallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned\n\nby the express authority of both your excellent parents, my\n\nproposals will not fail of being acceptable.\"\n\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence\n\nwithdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her\n\nrepeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her  father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to\n\nbe decisive, and whose behavior at least could not be\n\nmistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant\n\nfemale.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 20.\n\nMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in\n\nthe vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner\n\nsaw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her\n\ntowards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room,\n\nand congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the  happy prospect or their nearer connection. Mr. Collins\n\nreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure,\n\nand then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview,  with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be  satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly\n\ngiven him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and\n\nthe genuine delicacy of her character.\n\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she\n\nwould have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter\n\nhad meant to encourage him by protesting against his\n\nproposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not help\n\nsaying so.\n\n\"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy\n\nshall be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly.\n\nShe is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her\n\nown interest but I will MAKE her know it.\"\n \n\"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,\" cried Mr.\n\nCollins; \"but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know\n\n\n\nnot whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a  man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the\n\nmarriage state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting\n\nmy suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting  me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not  contribute much to my felicity.\"\n\n\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet,\n\nalarmed. \"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In  everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I  will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it\n\nwith her, I am sure.\"\n\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library,  \"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in\n\nan uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins,\n\nfor she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make\n\nhaste he will change his mind and not have HER.\"\n\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered,\n\nand fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was\n\nnot in the least altered by her communication.\n\n\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he,\n\nwhen she had finished her speech. \"Of what are you talking?\"\n\n\n\n\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not\n\nhave Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will\n\nnot have Lizzy.\"\n\n\"And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an\n\nhopeless business.\"\n\n\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist\n\nupon her marrying him.\"\n\n\"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\"\n\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was\n\nsummoned to the library.\n\n\"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared. \"I\n\nhave sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that  Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?\"  Elizabeth replied that it was. \"Very well--and this offer of\n\nmarriage you have refused?\"\n\n\"I have, sir.\"\n \n\"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother\n\ninsists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\"\n\n\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\n\n\n\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From  this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.\n\nYour mother will never see you again if you do NOT\n\nmarry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you\n\nDO.\"\n \nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such\n\na beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that\n\nher husband regarded the affair as she wished, was\n\nexcessively disappointed.\n\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You\n\npromised me to INSIST upon her marrying him.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" replied her husband, \"I have two small favours  to request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my  understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my\n\nroom. I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as\n\nmay be.\"\n\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to\n\nElizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.\n\nShe endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with\n\nall possible mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth,  sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful\n\ngaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner varied,\n\nhowever, her determination never did.\n\n\n\nMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. He thought too well of himself to\n\ncomprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him; and\n\nthough his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way. His  regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her  deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any\n\nregret.\n \nWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper,\n\n\"I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! What do\n\nyou think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has made\n\nan offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.\"\n\nCharlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were\n\njoined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no\n\nsooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs.  Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject,  calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her\n\nto persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all\n\nher family. \"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,\" she added in a  melancholy tone, \"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes  part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor\n\nnerves.\"\n \nCharlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and\n\nElizabeth.\n\n\n\n\"Aye, there she comes,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"looking\n\nas unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if\n\nwe were at York, provided she can have her own way. But I\n\ntell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it into your head to go on  refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never  get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is to\n\nmaintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to\n\nkeep you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this  very day. I told you in the library, you know, that I should  never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my\n\nword. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. Not\n\nthat I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody.  People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have  no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer!\n\nBut it is always so. Those who do not complain are never\n\npitied.\"\n\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only\n\nincrease the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without\n\ninterruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr.  Collins, who entered the room with an air more stately than  usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, \"Now, I\n\ndo insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and\n\nlet me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together.\"\n\nElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all\n\n\n\nshe could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr.  Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were\n\nvery minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself\n\nwith walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a  doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation:\n\n\"Oh! Mr. Collins!\"\n \n\"My dear madam,\" replied he, \"let us be for ever silent on\n\nthis point. Far be it from me,\" he presently continued, in a  voice that marked his displeasure, \"to resent the behaviour of  your daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the evil duty\n\nof us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so\n\nfortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am  resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my  positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her\n\nhand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so\n\nperfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat  of its value in our estimation. You will not, I hope, consider  me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam,\n\nby thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's\n\nfavour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the  compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in  my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having\n\naccepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of\n\nyour own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly meant  well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an  amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the\n\n\n\nadvantage of all your family, and if my MANNER has been at\n\nall reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.\"\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 21.\n\nThe discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some\n\npeevish allusions of her mother. As for the gentleman himself,\n\nHIS feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the\n\nassiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself\n\nwere transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose  civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all,  and especially to her friend.\n\nThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-\n\nhumour or ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of\n\nangry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might  shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least\n\naffected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and\n\nto Saturday he meant to stay.\n\nAfter breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if\n\nMr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence\n\nfrom the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the\n\ntown, and attended them to their aunt's where his regret and  vexation, and the concern of everybody, was well talked over.  To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the\n\nnecessity of his absence HAD been self-imposed.\n\n\n\n\"I found,\" said he, \"as the time drew near that I had better\n\nnot meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same\n\nparty with him for so many hours together, might be more\n\nthan I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to\n\nmore than myself.\"\n\nShe highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure\n\nfor a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which\n\nthey civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another  officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the  walk he particularly attended to her. His accompanying them\n\nwas a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered\n\nto herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of\n\nintroducing him to her father and mother.\n\nSoon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss\n\nBennet; it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a\n\nsheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a  lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's  countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling\n\nintently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself\n\nsoon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual  cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an  anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from\n\nWickham; and no sooner had he and he companion taken\n\nleave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her  upstairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking\n\nout the letter, said:\n\n\n\n\"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has\n\nsurprised me a good deal. The whole party have left\n\nNetherfield by this time, and are on their way to town--and\n\nwithout any intention of coming back again. You shall hear\n\nwhat she says.\"\n\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised\n\nthe information of their having just resolved to follow their\n\nbrother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in\n\nGrosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was\n\nin these words: \"I do not pretend to regret anything I shall\n\nleave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;\n\nbut we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns  of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the  meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very\n\nfrequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on\n\nyou for that.\" To these highflown expressions Elizabeth  listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the  suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in\n\nit really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence\n\nfrom Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there;  and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane  must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.\n\n\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you\n\nshould not be able to see your friends before they leave the  country. But may we not hope that the period of future  happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive\n\n\n\nearlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse  you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater\n\nsatisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in\n\nLondon by them.\"\n\n\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return\n\ninto Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:\"\n\n\"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the\n\nbusiness which took him to London might be concluded in  three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at  the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he\n\nwill be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on\n\nfollowing him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his  vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my  acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I\n\ncould hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of\n\nmaking one of the crowd--but of that I despair. I sincerely  hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the  gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your\n\nbeaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss\n\nof the three of whom we shall deprive you.\"\n\n\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no\n\nmore this winter.\"\n \n\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he\n\nSHOULD.\"\n\n\n\n\"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is\n\nhis own master. But you do not know ALL. I WILL read you\n\nthe passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no\n\nreserves from YOU.\"\n \n\"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess\n\nthe truth, WE are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I\n\nreally do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty,\n\nelegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires  in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more  interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being\n\nhereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before\n\nmentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not  leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will  not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her\n\ngreatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of\n\nseeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish  the connection as much as his own; and a sister's partiality is  not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable\n\nof engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances\n\nto favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I  wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event  which will secure the happiness of so many?\"\n\n\"What do you think of THIS sentence, my dear Lizzy?\"\n\nsaid Jane as she finished it. \"Is it not clear enough? Does it not  expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me  to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's\n\n\n\nindifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings  for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?\n\nCan there be any other opinion on the subject?\"\n\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear\n\nit?\"\n \n\"Most willingly.\"\n\n\"You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that\n\nher brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss  Darcy. She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there,  and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.\"\n\nJane shook her head.\n \n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has  ever seen you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley,  I am sure, cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have\n\nseen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would\n\nhave ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are  not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more  anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that\n\nwhen there has been ONE intermarriage, she may have less\n\ntrouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some  ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh  were out of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot\n\nseriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her\n\nbrother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\n\n\n\ndegree less sensible of YOUR merit than when he took leave  of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade\n\nhim that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in\n\nlove with her friend.\"\n \n\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\n\nrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy. But I\n\nknow the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of\n\nwilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case\n\nis that she is deceiving herself.\"\n\n\"That is right. You could not have started a more happy\n\nidea, since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to\n\nbe deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by\n\nher, and must fret no longer.\"\n\n\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the\n\nbest, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all\n\nwishing him to marry elsewhere?\"\n\n\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth; \"and if,\n\nupon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of\n\ndisobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the\n\nhappiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to\n\nrefuse him.\"\n \n\"How can you talk so?\" said Jane, faintly smiling. \"You\n\nmust know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at\n\ntheir disapprobation, I could not hesitate.\"\n\n\n\n\"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I\n\ncannot consider your situation with much compassion.\"\n\n\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will\n\nnever be required. A thousand things may arise in six\n\nmonths!\"\n \nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with\n\nthe utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion\n\nof Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a\n\nmoment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully  spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent\n\nof everyone.\n\nShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was\n\ngradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection\n\nsometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to\n\nNetherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\n\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the\n\ndeparture of the family, without being alarmed on the score of\n\nthe gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication  gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as  exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away\n\njust as they were all getting so intimate together. After\n\nlamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation  that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining\n\n\n\nat Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable  declaration, that though he had been invited only to a family\n\ndinner, she would take care to have two full courses.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 22.\n\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of\n\nthanking her. \"It keeps him in good humour,\" said she, \"and I\n\nam more obliged to you than I can express.\" Charlotte assured  her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply  repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very\n\namiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than\n\nElizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas's\n\nscheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they\n\nparted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if\n\nhe had\n \nnot been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did\n\ninjustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it\n\nled him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning  with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\n\nhimself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his\n\ncousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they\n\ncould not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing  to have the attempt known till its success might be known  likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason,\n\nfor Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was\n\ncomparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.\n\n\n\nHis reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss  Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked\n\ntowards the house, and instantly set out to meet him\n\naccidentally in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that\n\nso much love and eloquence awaited her there.\n\nIn as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would\n\nallow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction\n\nof both; and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated  her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of  men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the\n\npresent, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his\n\nhappiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by  nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could\n\nmake a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who\n\naccepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of\n\nan establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were\n\ngained.\n\nSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for\n\ntheir consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.\n\nMr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly\n\nfair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more\n\ninterest than the matter had ever excited before, how many  years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William  gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins\n\n\n\nshould be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be  highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their\n\nappearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short, were\n\nproperly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed  hopes of COM ING OUT a year or two sooner than they  might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from\n\ntheir apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid. Charlotte\n\nherself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and  had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in general  satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor\n\nagreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her\n\nmust be imaginary. But still he would be her husband.  Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage  had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-\n\neducated young women of small fortune, and however\n\nuncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest  preservative from want. This preservative she had now  obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever\n\nbeen handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least\n\nagreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it  must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she  valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would\n\nwonder, and probably would blame her; and though her\n\nresolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by  such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her the  information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when\n\nhe returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what\n\nhad passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy\n\n\n\nwas of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept  without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long\n\nabsence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return\n\nas required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same  time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish  his prosperous love.\n\nAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to\n\nsee any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was  performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs.  Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy\n\nthey should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his\n\nengagements might allow him to visit them.\n\n\"My dear madam,\" he replied, \"this invitation is\n\nparticularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping\n\nto receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail\n\nmyself of it as soon as possible.\"\n\nThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by\n\nno means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:\n\n\"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's\n\ndisapprobation here, my good sir? You had better neglect your\n\nrelations than run the risk of offending your patroness.\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" replied Mr. Collins,\" I am particularly\n\nobliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend\n\n\n\nupon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's\n\nconcurrence.\"\n \n\"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything\n\nrather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be  raised by your coming to us again, which I should think  exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied\n\nthat WE shall take no offence.\"\n \n\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited  by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will  speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for\n\nevery other mark of your regard during my stay in\n\nHertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting\n\nmy cousin Elizabeth.\"\n\nWith proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs.  Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying\n\nhis addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might\n\nhave been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities  much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his  reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so\n\nclever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and\n\nimprove himself by such an example as hers, he might  become a very agreeable companion. But on the following\n\n\n\nmorning, every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas  called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with\n\nElizabeth related the event of the day before.\n\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying herself in love\n\nwith her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last\n\nday or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed\n\nalmost as far from possibility as she could encourage him\n\nherself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to\n\novercome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not\n\nhelp crying out:\n\n\"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!\"\n\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it\n\nwas no more than she expected, she soon regained her\n\ncomposure, and calmly replied:\n\n\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you\n\nthink it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure\n\nany woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to\n\nsucceed with you?\"\n\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness\n\nthat the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to\n\nher, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.\n\n\n\n\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte. \"You must\n\nbe surprised, very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins\n\nwas wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to\n\nthink it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have  done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a  comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character,\n\nconnection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\n\nchance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can\n\nboast on entering the marriage state.\"\n\nElizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly;\" and after an\n\nawkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.\n\nCharlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before\n\nshe became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a\n\nmatch. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of\n\nmarriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his  being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's  opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she\n\nhad not supposed it to be possible that, when called into\n\naction, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to  worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a  most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend\n\ndisgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the\n\ndistressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to\n\nbe tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.\n\n\n\nChapter 23.\n\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she was\n\nauthorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself\n\nappeared, sent by his daughter, to announce her engagement\n\nto the family. With many compliments to them, and much  self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the  houses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely\n\nwondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more\n\nperseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely  mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil,  boisterously exclaimed:\n\n\"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?\n\nDo not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\n\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's\n\ngood breeding carried him through it all; and though he\n\nbegged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information,  he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing\n\ncourtesy.\n\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from\n\nso unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm  his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from  Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the\n\nexclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of\n\n\n\nher congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily  joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\n\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the\n\nexcellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance\n\nof Hunsford from London.\n \nMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a\n\ngreat deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he\n\nleft them than her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first  place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter;  secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken\n\nin; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy\n\ntogether; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.  Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the\n\nwhole: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief;\n\nand the other that she herself had been barbarously misused\n\nby them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt  during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing  could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her resentment.\n\nA week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\n\nscolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to  Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many  months were gone before she could at all forgive their\n\ndaughter.\n\nMr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to\n\n\n\ndiscover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to\n\nthink tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more\n\nfoolish than his daughter!\n\nJane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but\n\nshe said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for\n\ntheir happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider\n\nit as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss\n\nLucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at  Meryton.\n\nLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being\n\nable to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter  well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than  usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet's sour\n\nlooks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to\n\ndrive happiness away.\n\nBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint\n\nwhich kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth\n\nfelt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist\n\nbetween them again. Her disappointment in Charlotte made  her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude  and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken,\n\nand for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as\n\nBingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was\n\nheard of his return.\n\n\n\nJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear\n\nagain. The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived\n\non Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the  solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the  family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience\n\non that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many\n\nrapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the  affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then  explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her\n\nsociety that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish\n\nof seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be  able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he  added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to\n\ntake place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an\n\nunanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an\n\nearly day for making him the happiest of men.\n\nMr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a\n\nmatter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as\n\nmuch disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very  strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas  Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly\n\ntroublesome. She hated having visitors in the house while her\n\nhealth was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the  most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs.  Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr.\n\nBingley's continued absence.\n\n\n\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this\n\nsubject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other\n\ntidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in\n\nMeryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which\n\nshe never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.\n \nEven Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was\n\nindifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping  him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so  destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonorable to the\n\nstability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently\n\noccurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and  of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss  Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she\n\nfeared, for the strength of his attachment.\n\nAs for Jane, HER anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and\n\nElizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as\n\nno such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed  in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience  for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did\n\nnot come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed\n\nall Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\n\ntranquillity.\n\n\n\nMr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it\n\nhad been on his first introduction. He was too happy,\n\nhowever, to need much attention; and luckily for the others,  the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal  of his company. The chief of every day was spent by him at\n\nLucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only\n\nin time to make an apology for his absence before the family\n\nwent to bed.\n \nMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very\n\nmention of anything concerning the match threw her into an\n\nagony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of  hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to  her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her with\n\njealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them,\n\nshe concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession;  and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was  convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and\n\nresolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as\n\nsoon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly of all\n\nthis to her husband.\n \n\"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,\" said she, \"it is very hard to think\n\nthat Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house,\n\nthat I should be forced to make way for HER, and live to see\n\nher take her place in it!\"\n\n\n\n\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let\n\nus hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be\n\nthe survivor.\"\n \nThis was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore,\n\ninstead of making any answer, she went on as before.\n\n\"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.\n\nIf it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.\"\n\n\"What should not you mind?\"\n\n\"I should not mind anything at all.\"\n\n\"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of\n\nsuch insensibility.\"\n\n\"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about  the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail  away an estate from one's own daughters, I cannot\n\nunderstand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why\n\nshould HE have it more than anybody else?\"\n\n\"I leave it to yourself to determine,\" said Mr. Bennet.\n\n\n\nChapter 24.\n\nMiss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all\n\nsettled in London for the winter, and concluded with her\n\nbrother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to\n\nhis friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.\n\nHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed\n\naffection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss\n\nDarcy's praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing   intimacy,   and   ventured   to   predict   the\n\naccomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her\n\nformer letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her  brother's being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and  mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard\n\nto new furniture.\n \nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against\n\nall others. To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial\n\nto Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was really fond of\n\nJane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much\n\nas she had always been disposed to like him, she could not\n\nthink without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\n\nof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made\n\n\n\nhim the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice  of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination. Had\n\nhis own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might\n\nhave been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he  thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought  he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on\n\nwhich reflection would be long indulged, and must be\n\nunavailing. She could think of nothing else; and yet whether  Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by\n\nhis friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's\n\nattachment, or whether it had escaped his observation;\n\nwhatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be  materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation  remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\n\nA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of\n\nher feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving  them together, after a longer irritation than usual about  Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying:\n\n\"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself!\n\nShe can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were\n\nbefore.\"\n \nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude,\n\nbut said nothing.\n\n\n\n\"You doubt me,\" cried Jane, slightly colouring; \"indeed,\n\nyou have no reason. He may live in my memory as the most\n\namiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have\n\nnothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him  with. Thank God! I have not THAT pain. A little time,  therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.\"\n\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, \"I have this comfort\n\nimmediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy  on my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but  myself.\"\n\n\"My dear Jane!\" exclaimed Elizabeth, \"you are too good.\n\nYour sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.\"\n\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit,\n\nand threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Elizabeth, \"this is not fair. YOU wish to think\n\nall the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of\n\nanybody. I only want to think YOU perfect, and you set\n\nyourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any  excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal  good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really\n\nlove, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of\n\nthe world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day  confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human\n\n\n\ncharacters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on  the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with two\n\ninstances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's\n\nmarriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is\n\nunaccountable!\"\n \n\"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.\n\nThey will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance\n\nenough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr.  Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's steady, prudent  character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as\n\nto fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe,\n\nfor everybody's sake, that she may feel something like regard\n\nand esteem for our cousin.\"\n \n\"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but\n\nno one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for\n\nwere I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I  should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of  her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous,\n\nnarrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do;\n\nand you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who  married him cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall  not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for\n\nthe sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle\n\nand integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that  selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security  for happiness.\"\n\n\n\n\"I must think your language too strong in speaking of\n\nboth,\" replied Jane; \"and I hope you will be convinced of it by\n\nseeing them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded\n\nto something else. You mentioned TWO instances. I cannot  misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain  me by thinking THAT PERSON to blame, and saying your\n\nopinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy\n\nourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively  young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is  very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.\n\nWomen fancy admiration means more than it does.\"\n\n\"And men take care that they should.\"\n\n\"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I\n\nhave no idea of there being so much design in the world as\n\nsome persons imagine.\"\n\n\"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's  conduct to design,\" said Elizabeth; \"but without scheming to  do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and\n\nthere may be misery. Thoughtlessness, want of attention to\n\nother people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the\n\nbusiness.\"\n \n\"And do you impute it to either of those?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by\n\nsaying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst\n\nyou can.\"\n\n\"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?\"\n\n\"Yes, in conjunction with his friend.\"\n\n\"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him?\n\nThey can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me,\n\nno other woman can secure it.\"\n \n\"Your first position is false. They may wish many things\n\nbesides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth\n\nand consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has\n\nall the importance of money, great connections, and pride.\"\n\n\"Beyond a doubt, they DO wish him to choose Miss\n\nDarcy,\" replied Jane; \"but this may be from better feelings\n\nthan you are supposing. They have known her much longer\n\nthan they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.  But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely  they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would\n\nthink herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something\n\nvery objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they  would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.  By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting\n\nunnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not distress\n\nme by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistaken--\n\n\n\nor, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I  should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it\n\nin the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.\"\n\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time\n\nMr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between\n\nthem.\n \nMrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his\n\nreturning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which  Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance  of her ever considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter\n\nendeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe\n\nherself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect  of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw  her no more; but though the probability of the statement was\n\nadmitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every\n\nday. Mrs. Bennet's best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be\n\ndown again in the summer.\n\nMr. Bennet treated the matter differently. \"So, Lizzy,\" said\n\nhe one day, \"your sister is crossed in love, I find. I\n\ncongratulate her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be  crossed a little in love now and then. It is something to think  of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her\n\ncompanions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear\n\nto be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are  officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies\n\n\n\nin the country. Let Wickham be YOUR man. He is a pleasant\n\nfellow, and would jilt you creditably.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy\n\nme. We must not all expect Jane's good fortune.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"but it is a comfort to think that\n\nwhatever of that kind may befall you, you have an\n\naffectionate mother who will make the most of it.\"\n \nMr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family. They saw him\n\noften, and to his other recommendations was now added that\n\nof general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had  already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had  suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and\n\npublicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how\n\nmuch they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had\n\nknown anything of the matter.\n\nMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose\n\nthere might be any extenuating circumstances in the case,\n\nunknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady  candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the  possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was\n\ncondemned as the worst of men.\n\n\n\nChapter 25.\n\nAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however,\n\nmight be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the\n\nreception of his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly  after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that  was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his\n\nrelations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before;\n\nwished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and\n\npromised their father another letter of thanks.\n\nOn the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of\n\nreceiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to\n\nspend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a  sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as  well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would\n\nhave had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade,\n\nand within view of his own warehouses, could have been so\n\nwell-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several  years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an\n\namiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite\n\nwith all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and  herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard. They  had frequently been staying with her in town.\n\nThe first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival\n\nwas to distribute her presents and describe the newest fash\n\n\n\nions. When this was done she had a less active part to play. It  became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to\n\nrelate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-\n\nused since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been  upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in\n\nit.\n \n\"I do not blame Jane,\" she continued, \"for Jane would have\n\ngot Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very  hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by  this time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made\n\nher an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The\n\nconsequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter  married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as  much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people\n\nindeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to\n\nsay it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and  poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have  neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.\n\nHowever, your coming just at this time is the greatest of\n\ncomforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long\n\nsleeves.\"\n \nMrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been\n\ngiven before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's\n\ncorrespondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and,\n\nin compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation.\n\n\n\nWhen alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. \"It seems likely to have been a desirable match for\n\nJane,\" said she. \"I am sorry it went off. But these things\n\nhappen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr.  Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few  weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets\n\nher, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.\"\n\n\"An excellent consolation in its way,\" said Elizabeth, \"but  it will not do for US. We do not suffer by ACCIDENT. It  does not often happen that the interference of friends will\n\npersuade a young man of independent fortune to think no\n\nmore of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few\n\ndays before.\"\n\n\"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed,\n\nso doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is\n\nas often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's  acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how  VIOLENT WAS Mr. Bingley's love?\"\n\n\"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing\n\nquite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.  Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At  his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not\n\nasking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself,\n\nwithout receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms?\n\nIs not general incivility the very essence of love?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to\n\nhave felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her\n\ndisposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better\n\nhave happened to YOU, Lizzy; you would have laughed  yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be  prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be\n\nof service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as\n\nuseful as anything.\"\n\nElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and\n\nfelt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.\n\n\"I hope,\" added Mrs. Gardiner, \"that no consideration with\n\nregard to this young man will influence her. We live in so  different a part of town, all our connections are so different,  and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very\n\nimprobable that they should meet at all, unless he really\n\ncomes to see her.\"\n \n\"And THAT is quite impossible; for he is now in the\n\ncustody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer\n\nhim to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt,\n\nhow could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have  HEARD of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would  hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from\n\nits impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it,\n\nMr. Bingley never stirs without him.\"\n\n\n\n\"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But\n\ndoes not Jane correspond with his sister? SHE will not be able\n\nto help calling.\"\n\n\"She will drop the acquaintance entirely.\"\n\nBut in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of\n\nBingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a\n\nsolicitude on the subject which convinced her, on  examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. It  was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his\n\naffection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends\n\nsuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's\n\nattractions.\n \nMiss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure;\n\nand the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the\n\nsame time, than as she hoped by Caroline's not living in the  same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a  morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.\n\nThe Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with\n\nthe Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a  day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully  provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that\n\nthey did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the\n\nengagement was for home, some of the officers always made  part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one;\n\n\n\nand on these occasion, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by  Elizabeth's warm commendation, narrowly observed them\n\nboth. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very\n\nseriously in love, their preference of each other was plain  enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak  to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and\n\nrepresent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an\n\nattachment.\n \nTo Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a\n\ndozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a\n\nconsiderable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he  belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintances in  common; and though Wickham had been little there since the\n\ndeath of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her\n\nfresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in\n\nthe way of procuring.\n\nMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr.\n\nDarcy by character perfectly well. Here consequently was an\n\ninexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing her  recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which  Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on\n\nthe character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him\n\nand herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr.  Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that  gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad which might\n\n\n\nagree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected  having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a\n\nvery proud, ill-natured boy.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 26.\n\nMrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus\n\nwent on:\n \n\"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely  because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not  afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on\n\nyour guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve\n\nhim in an affection which the want of fortune would make so\n\nvery imprudent. I have nothing to say against HIM; he is a  most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he\n\nought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it\n\nis, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have  sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would  depend on YOUR resolution and good conduct, I am sure.\n\nYou must not disappoint your father.\"\n\n\"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take\n\ncare of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in\n\nlove with me, if I can prevent it.\"\n\n\"Elizabeth, you are not serious now.\"\n\n\n\n\"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in\n\nlove with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is,\n\nbeyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw--\n\nand if he becomes really attached to me--I believe it will be  better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh!  THAT abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me\n\ndoes me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to\n\nforfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In  short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of  making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that\n\nwhere there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by\n\nimmediate want of fortune from entering into engagements  with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many  of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to\n\nknow that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise\n\nyou, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry  to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with  him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming\n\nhere so very often. At least, you should not REMIND you\n\nmother of inviting him.\"\n\n\"As I did the other day,\" said Elizabeth with a conscious\n\nsmile: \"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from THAT.\n\nBut do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week.  You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant\n\n\n\ncompany for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I  will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope\n\nyou are satisfied.\"\n\nHer aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point,\n\nwithout being resented.\n\nMr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had\n\nbeen quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his  abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great\n\ninconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast\n\napproaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think  it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone,  that she \"WISHED they might be happy.\" Thursday was to be\n\nthe wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her\n\nfarewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth,\n\nashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good  wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of\n\nthe room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:\n\n\"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\"\n\n\"THAT you certainly shall.\"\n\n\"And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and\n\nsee me?\"\n\n\n\n\"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\"\n\n\"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me,\n\ntherefore, to come to Hunsford.\"\n\nElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little\n\npleasure in the visit.\n\n\"My father and Maria are coming to me in March,\" added\n\nCharlotte, \"and I hope you will consent to be of the party.\n\nIndeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.\"\n\nThe wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to\n\nsay, or to hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard\n\nfrom her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and  frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally  unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her\n\nwithout feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and\n\nthough determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was\n\nfor the sake of what had been, rather than what was.\n\nCharlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of\n\neagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she\n\nwould speak of her new home, how she would like Lady  Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself  to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that\n\nCharlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she\n\nmight have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed  surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she\n\n\n\ncould not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and  roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour\n\nwas most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of\n\nHunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know\n\nthe rest.\n \nJane had already written a few lines to her sister to\n\nannounce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote\n\nagain, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say\n\nsomething of the Bingleys.\n\nHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded\n\nas impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town  without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted  for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend\n\nfrom Longbourn had by some accident been lost.\n\n\"My aunt,\" she continued, \"is going to-morrow into that\n\npart of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in\n\nGrosvenor Street.\"\n \nShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen\n\nMiss Bingley. \"I did not think Caroline in spirits,\" were her words, \"but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London. I was right,\n\ntherefore, my last letter had never reached her. I inquired after\n\ntheir brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged  with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that\n\n\n\nMiss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out.\n\nI dare say I shall see them soon here.\"\n\nElizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her\n\nthat accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's\n\nbeing in town.\n\nFour weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.\n\nShe endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention.  After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and\n\ninventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did\n\nat last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the\n\nalteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself\n\nno longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her\n\nsister will prove what she felt.\n\n\"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of  triumphing in her better judgement, at my expense, when I  confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss\n\nBingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the event\n\nhas proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert  that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was  as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her\n\nreason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same\n\ncircumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be  deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;\n\n\n\nand not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When\n\nshe did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in\n\nit; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before,\n\nsaid not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every  respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was  perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I\n\npity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in\n\nsingling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance  to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she  must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am\n\nvery sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need\n\nnot explain myself farther; and though WE know this anxiety  to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account  for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his\n\nsister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural\n\nand amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any\n\nsuch fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we\n\nmust have met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am\n\ncertain, from something she said herself; and yet it would\n\nseem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade  herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot  understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should\n\nbe almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of\n\nduplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every  painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy-your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle\n\nand aunt. Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said\n\nsomething of his never returning to Netherfield again, of\n\n\n\ngiving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better  not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such\n\npleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see\n\nthem, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very\n\ncomfortable there.--Yours, etc.\"\n \nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits\n\nreturned as she considered that Jane would no longer be\n\nduped, by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother  was now absolutely over. She would not even wish for a  renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review\n\nof it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible\n\nadvantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon  marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would  make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.\n\nMrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her\n\npromise concerning that gentleman, and required information;  and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give  contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality\n\nhad subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of\n\nsome one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but  she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her  heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was\n\nsatisfied with believing that SHE would have been his only\n\nchoice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten  thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young  lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but\n\n\n\nElizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in  Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of\n\nindependence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more\n\nnatural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few  struggle to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and  desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him\n\nhappy.\n\nAll this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on: \"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love;\n\nfor had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I\n\nshould at present detest his very name, and wish him all  manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards  HIM; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot\n\nfind out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling\n\nto think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in  all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I  certainly should be a more interesting object to all my\n\nacquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot\n\nsay that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance  may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take  his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in\n\nthe ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying\n\nconviction that handsome young men must have something to\n\nlive on as well as the plain.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 27.\n\nWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to  Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January\n\nand February pass away. March was to take Elizabeth to\n\nHunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with\n\ngreater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had\n\nincreased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened  her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme,  and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters,\n\nhome could not be faultless, a little change was not\n\nunwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover  give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near,  she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything,\n\nhowever, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according\n\nto Charlotte's first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William  and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a  night in London was added in time, and the plan became\n\nperfect as plan could be.\n\nThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and\n\nalmost promised to answer her letter.\n\n\n\nThe farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was\n\nperfectly friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit\n\ncould not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to\n\nexcite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to\n\npity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her  adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what\n\nshe was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting\n\ntheir opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would  always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she  felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard;\n\nand she parted from him convinced that, whether married or\n\nsingle, he must always be her model of the amiable and\n\npleasing.\n\nHer fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to\n\nmake her think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his\n\ndaughter Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed  as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing,  and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of\n\nthe chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir\n\nWilliam's too long. He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities\n\nwere worn out, like his information.\n \nIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began\n\nit so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they  drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room  window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage\n\n\n\nshe was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking  earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely\n\nas ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\n\nwhose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not  allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness,  as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their\n\ncoming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most\n\npleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the\n\nevening at one of the theatres.\n\nElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first\n\nobject was her sister; and she was more grieved than\n\nastonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that  though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were  periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that\n\nthey would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the\n\nparticulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street,  and repeated conversations occurring at different times  between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had,\n\nfrom her heart, given up the acquaintance.\n\nMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's\n\ndesertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.\n\n\"But my dear Elizabeth,\" she added, \"what sort of girl is\n\nMiss King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\"\n\n\"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial\n\naffairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?\n\n\n\nWhere does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be\n\nimprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with\n\nonly ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is\n\nmercenary.\"\n\n\"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I\n\nshall know what to think.\"\n \n\"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm\n\nof her.\"\n \n\"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her\n\ngrandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune.\"\n\n\"No--what should he? If it were not allowable for him to\n\ngain MY affections because I had no money, what occasion  could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care\n\nabout, and who was equally poor?\"\n\n\"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions\n\ntowards her so soon after this event.\"\n \n\"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all\n\nthose elegant decorums which other people may observe. If\n\nSHE does not object to it, why should WE?\"\n\n\"HER not objecting does not justify HIM. It only shows\n\nher being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well,\" cried Elizabeth, \"have it as you choose. HE shall\n\nbe mercenary, and SHE shall be foolish.\"\n\n\"No, Lizzy, that is what I do NOT choose. I should be\n\nsorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so\n\nlong in Derbyshire.\"\n\n\"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men\n\nwho live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in\n\nHertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all.\n\nThank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither\n\nmanner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only\n\nones worth knowing, after all.\"\n\n\"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of\n\ndisappointment.\"\n\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play,\n\nshe had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to  accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which  they proposed taking in the summer.\n\n\"We have not determined how far it shall carry us,\" said\n\nMrs. Gardiner, \"but, perhaps, to the Lakes.\"\n\nNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and\n\ngrateful.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, my dear, dear aunt,\" she rapturously cried, \"what\n\ndelight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour.\n\nAdieu to disappointment and spleen. What are young men to\n\nrocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall  spend! And when we DO return, it shall not be like other  travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of\n\nanything. We WILL know where we have gone--we WILL\n\nrecollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers\n\nshall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor when  we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin\n\nquarreling about its relative situation. Let OUR first effusions\n\nbe less insupportable than those of the generality of\n\ntravellers.\"\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 28.\n\nEvery object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to\n\nbanish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern\n\ntour was a constant source of delight.\n\nWhen they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning\n\nexpected to bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was\n\ntheir boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the\n\nrecollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.\n \nAt length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden\n\nsloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales,\n\nand the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving.  Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the  carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel\n\nwalk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole\n\nparty. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at  the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with  the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more\n\nsatisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately\n\nreceived. She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not  altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it  had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear\n\nand satisfy his inquiries after all her family. They were then,\n\nwith no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the\n\n\n\nentrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the  parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious\n\nformality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his\n\nwife's offers of refreshment.\n \nElizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good\n\nproportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he\n\naddressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make  her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though  everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to\n\ngratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with\n\nwonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air\n\nwith such a companion. When Mr. Collins said anything of  which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly\n\nwas not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on\n\nCharlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in\n\ngeneral Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long  enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from\n\nthe sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their\n\njourney, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins  invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large\n\nand well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended\n\nhimself. To work in this garden was one of his most\n\nrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of\n\ncountenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness\n\nof the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as\n\npossible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross\n\n\n\nwalk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the  praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a\n\nminuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could\n\nnumber the fields in every direction, and could tell how many  tress there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views  which his garden, or which the country or kingdom could\n\nboast, none were to be compared with the prospect of\n\nRosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\n\nFrom his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round\n\nhis two meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to\n\nencounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while\n\nSir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and\n\nfriend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to\n\nhave the opportunity of showing it without her husband's help.\n\nIt was rather small, but well built and convenient; and\n\neverything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and\n\nconsistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.\n\nWhen Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\n\nforgotten.\n\nShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed:\n\n\n\n\"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing\n\nLady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church,\n\nand I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all\n\naffability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be  honoured with some portion of her notice when service is  over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include\n\nyou and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\n\nhonours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear  Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week,  and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage\n\nis regularly ordered for us. I SHOULD say, one of her\n\nladyship's carriages, for she has several.\"\n\n\"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman\n\nindeed,\" added Charlotte, \"and a most attentive neighbour.\"\n\n\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the\n\nsort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much\n\ndeference.\"\n \nThe evening was spent chiefly in talking over\n\nHertfordshire news, and telling again what had already been\n\nwritten; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her\n\nchamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of  contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and\n\ncomposure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge\n\nthat it was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how  her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual\n\n\n\nemployments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and  the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively\n\nimagination soon settled it all.\n\nAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a\n\nmoment, she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent\n\nhurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the door and  met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation,\n\ncried out-\n \n\"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the\n\ndining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell\n\nyou what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment.\"\n\nElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her\n\nnothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which\n\nfronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies\n\nstopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.\n\n\"And is this all?\" cried Elizabeth. \"I expected at least that\n\nthe pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but\n\nLady Catherine and her daughter.\"\n\n\"La! my dear,\" said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \"it\n\nis not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who\n\nlives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at\n\n\n\nher. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought\n\nthat she could be so thin and small?\"\n \n\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in\n\nall this wind. Why does she not come in?\"\n\n\"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest\n\nof favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\"\n\n\"I like her appearance,\" said Elizabeth, struck with other\n\nideas. \"She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him\n\nvery well. She will make him a very proper wife.\"\n\nMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in\n\nconversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's\n\nhigh diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest  contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly  bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.\n\nAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies\n\ndrove on, and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins\n\nno sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate  them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by\n\nletting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at\n\nRosings the next day.\n\n\n\nChapter 29.\n\nMr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see\n\nher civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he\n\nhad wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be  given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's  condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.\n\n\"I confess,\" said he, \"that I should not have been at all\n\nsurprised by her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea  and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my  knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who\n\ncould have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have\n\nimagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an  invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so  immediately after your arrival!\"\n\n\"I am the less surprised at what has happened,\" replied Sir\n\nWilliam, \"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such instances of elegant breeding\n\nare not uncommon.\"\n \nScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of\n\n\n\nsuch rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might\n\nnot wholly overpower them.\n\nWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to\n\nElizabeth-\n \n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your\n\napparel. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of\n\ndress in us which becomes herself and her daughter. I would\n\nadvise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is  superior to the rest--there is no occasion for anything more.  Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being\n\nsimply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank\n\npreserved.\"\n\nWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady\n\nCatherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her\n\ndinner. Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her  manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been  little used to company, and she looked forward to her\n\nintroduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her\n\nfather had done to his presentation at St. James's.\n\nAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its\n\nprospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though\n\nshe could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the  scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his\n\n\n\nenumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his\n\nrelation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir\n\nLewis de Bourgh.\n\nWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm. Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She\n\nhad heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful\n\nfrom any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the  mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could  witness without trepidation.\n\nFrom the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out,\n\nwith a rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished  ornaments, they followed the servants through an antechamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter,\n\nand Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship, with great\n\ncondescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had\n\nsettled it with her husband that the office of introduction\n\nshould be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without\n\nany of those apologies and thanks which he would have\n\nthought necessary.\n\nIn spite of having been at St. James's Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he\n\nhad but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take\n\nhis seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened  almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not\n\n\n\nknowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite  equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before\n\nher composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with\n\nstrongly-marked features, which might once have been  handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner  of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their\n\ninferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but\n\nwhatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as  marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham  immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of\n\nthe day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly\n\nwhat he represented.\n\nWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr.\n\nDarcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost\n\nhave joined in Maria's astonishment at her being so thin and  so small. There was neither in figure nor face any likeness  between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her\n\nfeatures, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke\n\nvery little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose  appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was  entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a\n\nscreen in the proper direction before her eyes.\n\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to\n\n\n\npoint out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing\n\nthem that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.\n\nThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all\n\nthe servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had  promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at  the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as\n\nif he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved,\n\nand ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish  was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who  was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law\n\nsaid, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine\n\ncould bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their  excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles,  especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to\n\nthem. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth\n\nwas ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she  was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former  of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the\n\nlatter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson\n\nwas chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh  ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was  indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and\n\nthe gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\n\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her\n\n\n\nopinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved  that she was not used to have her judgement controverted. She\n\ninquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and\n\nminutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the  management of them all; told her how everything ought to be  regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to\n\nthe care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that\n\nnothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could  furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the\n\nintervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a\n\nvariety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to\n\nthe latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who\n\nshe observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel, pretty kind  of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters she\n\nhad, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether\n\nany of them were likely to be married, whether they were  handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her  father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?\n\nElizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but\n\nanswered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then\n\nobserved,\n \n\"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For\n\nyour sake,\" turning to Charlotte, \"I am glad of it; but\n\notherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the  female line. It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de  Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?\"\n\n\n\n\"A little.\"\n \n\"Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear\n\nyou. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to---\n\nYou shall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?\"\n\n\"One of them does.\"\n \n\"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned.\n\nThe Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an\n\nincome as yours. Do you draw?\"\n\n\"No, not at all.\"\n \n\"What, none of you?\"\n\n\"Not one.\"\n \n\"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no  opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town  every spring for the benefit of masters.\"\n\n\"My mother would have had no objection, but my father\n\nhates London.\"\n \n\"Has your governess left you?\"\n\n\"We never had any governess.\"\n\n\n\n\"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters\n\nbrought up at home without a governess! I never heard of\n\nsuch a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to\n\nyour education.\"\n\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that\n\nhad not been the case.\n \n\"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a\n\ngoverness, you must have been neglected.\"\n\n\"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but\n\nsuch of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We\n\nwere always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that\n\nwere necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.\"\n\n\"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent,\n\nand if I had known your mother, I should have advised her\n\nmost strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is\n\nto be done in education without steady and regular instruction,  and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how  many families I have been the means of supplying in that way.\n\nI am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four\n\nnieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated  through my means; and it was but the other day that I  recommended another young person, who was merely\n\naccidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\n\ndelighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady  Metcalf's calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope\n\n\n\na treasure. 'Lady Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a\n\ntreasure.' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, all.\"\n\n\"All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only  the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are  married! Your younger sisters must be very young?\"\n\n\"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps SHE is full\n\nyoung to be much in company. But really, ma'am, I think it  would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not  have their share of society and amusement, because the elder\n\nmay not have the means or inclination to marry early. The\n\nlast-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth at the  first. And to be kept back on SUCH a motive! I think it would  not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of\n\nmind.\"\n \n\"Upon my word,\" said her ladyship, \"you give your  opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is  your age?\"\n\n\"With three younger sisters grown up,\" replied Elizabeth,\n\nsmiling, \"your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\"\n\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first\n\n\n\ncreature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified\n\nimpertinence.\n\n\"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you\n\nneed not conceal your age.\"\n\n\"I am not one-and-twenty.\"\n\nWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over,\n\nthe card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and\n\nMr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de  Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table\n\nwas superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that\n\ndid not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson  expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too  cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more\n\npassed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally\n\nspeaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating  some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was employed in  agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for\n\nevery fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too\n\nmany. Sir William did not say much. He was storing his\n\nmemory with anecdotes and noble names.\n\nWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long\n\nas they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was\n\noffered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately  ordered. The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady\n\n\n\nCatherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the\n\narrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness\n\non Mr. Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they  departed. As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth  was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she\n\nhad seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made\n\nmore favourable than it really was. But her commendation,  though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy  Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her\n\nladyship's praise into his own hands.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 30.\n\nSir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and\n\nsuch a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir\n\nWilliam was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual\n\nemployments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did\n\nnot see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of  the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him  either at work in the garden or in reading and writing, and\n\nlooking out of the window in his own book-room, which\n\nfronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was\n\nbackwards. Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that\n\nCharlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common\n\nuse; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant\n\naspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent  reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly  have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one\n\nequally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the\n\narrangement.\n \nFrom the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge\n\nof what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss\n\nde Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed\n\n\n\ncoming to inform them of, though it happened almost every  day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a\n\nfew minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely\n\never prevailed upon to get out.\n\nVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to\n\nRosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it\n\nnecessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that\n\nthere might be other family livings to be disposed of, she  could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and  then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and\n\nnothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room\n\nduring these visits. She examined into their employments,  looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently;  found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected\n\nthe housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any\n\nrefreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out  that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her  family.\n\nElizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was\n\nnot in commission of the peace of the county, she was a most  active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of  which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any\n\nof the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome,\n\ndiscontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to  settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold  them into harmony and plenty.\n\n\n\nThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and\n\nthere being only one card-table in the evening, every such\n\nentertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other  engagements were few, as the style of living in the  neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach.\n\nThis, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole\n\nshe spent her time comfortably enough; there were half-hours  of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was  so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment\n\nout of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she frequently\n\nwent while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was  along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where  there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value\n\nbut herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady\n\nCatherine's curiosity.\n\nIn this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was\n\nto bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so\n\nsmall a circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon  after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the  course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her\n\nacquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would\n\nfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings  parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss  Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin,\n\nfor whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who\n\n\n\ntalked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of  him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost\n\nangry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss\n\nLucas and herself.\n \nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr.\n\nCollins was walking the whole morning within view of the\n\nlodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the\n\nearliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as the  carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great  intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to\n\nRosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady\n\nCatherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord  ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr.\n\nCollins returned, the gentleman accompanied him. Charlotte\n\nhad seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road,  and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an  honour they might expect, adding:\n\n\"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr.\n\nDarcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.\"\n\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the\n\ndoorbell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered\n\nthe room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about  thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the\n\n\n\ngentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look  in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual\n\nreserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings\n\ntoward her friend, met her with every appearance of  composure. Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying\n\na word.\n \nColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with\n\nthe readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very  pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight  observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for\n\nsome time without speaking to anybody. At length, however,\n\nhis civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth  after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual  way, and after a moment's pause, added:\n\n\"My eldest sister has been in town these three months.\n\nHave you never happened to see her there?\"\n\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of\n\nwhat had passed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she\n\nthought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had  never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The subject  was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards\n\nwent away.\n\n\n\nChapter 31.\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings.\n\nIt was some days, however, before they received any\n\ninvitation thither-for while there were visitors in the house,\n\nthey could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,  almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were\n\nhonoured by such an attention, and then they were merely\n\nasked on leaving church to come there in the evening. For the  last week they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her  daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage\n\nmore than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen\n\nonly at church.\n\nThe invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her\n\nladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their\n\ncompany was by no means so acceptable as when she could  get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her  nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more\n\nthan to any other person in the room.\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs.  Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very\n\nmuch. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably\n\nof Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home,\n\n\n\nof new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\n\nwell enter tained in that room before; and they conversed with\n\nso much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady\n\nCatherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy. HIS eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while, shared the\n\nfeeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not\n\nscruple to call out:\n\n\"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you\n\nare talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear\n\nwhat it is.\"\n \n\"We are speaking of music, madam,\" said he, when no\n\nlonger able to avoid a reply.\n\n\"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my\n\ndelight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are\n\nspeaking of music. There are few people in England, I  suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than  myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should\n\nhave been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health\n\nhad allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have\n\nperformed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\"\n\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's\n\nproficiency.\n\n\n\n\"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\" said\n\nLady Catherine; \"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot\n\nexpect to excel if she does not practice a good deal.\"\n\n\"I assure you, madam,\" he replied, \"that she does not need\n\nsuch advice. She practises very constantly.\"\n\n\"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when\n\nI next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any\n\naccount. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music  is to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss  Bennet several times, that she will never play really well\n\nunless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no\n\ninstrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to  come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.  Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know,\n\nin that part of the house.\"\n\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-\n\nbreeding, and made no answer.\n\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded\n\nElizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down\n\ndirectly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady  Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to  her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and\n\nmaking with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte\n\nstationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair\n\nperformer's countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing,\n\n\n\nand at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch\n\nsmile, and said:\n \n\"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all\n\nthis state to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister  DOES play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that  never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My\n\ncourage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.\"\n\n\"I shall not say you are mistaken,\" he replied, \"because  you could not really believe me to entertain any design of  alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your\n\nacquaintance long enough to know that you find great\n\nenjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact\n\nare not your own.\"\n\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and\n\nsaid to Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"Your cousin will give you a very\n\npretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.  I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to  expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had\n\nhoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed,\n\nMr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to\n\nretaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your\n\nrelations to hear.\"\n \n\"I am not afraid of you,\" said he, smilingly.\n\n\n\n\"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\" cried\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam. \"I should like to know how he behaves\n\namong strangers.\"\n\n\"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something  very dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in  Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball--and at this ball,\n\nwhat do you think he did? He danced only four dances,\n\nthough gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge,  more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a  partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.\"\n\n\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in\n\nthe assembly beyond my own party.\"\n\n\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room.\n\nWell, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers\n\nwait your orders.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Darcy, \"I should have judged better, had I  sought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend  myself to strangers.\"\n\n\"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\" said\n\nElizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?\"\n\n\n\n\"I can answer your question,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"without\n\napplying to him. It is because he will not give himself the\n\ntrouble.\"\n \n\"I certainly have not the talent which some people\n\npossess,\" said Darcy, \"of conversing easily with those I have\n\nnever seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or\n\nappear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.\"\n\n\"My fingers,\" said Elizabeth, \"do not move over this  instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many  women's do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do\n\nnot produce the same expression. But then I have always\n\nsupposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the  trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe MY fingers  as capable as any other woman's of superior execution.\"\n\nDarcy smiled and said, \"You are perfectly right. You have\n\nemployed your time much better. No one admitted to the  privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting. We  neither of us perform to strangers.\"\n\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called\n\nout to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately  began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after  listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy:\n\n\"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised\n\nmore, and could have the advantage of a London master. She\n\n\n\nhas a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not  equal to Anne's. Anne would have been a delightful\n\nperformer, had her health allowed her to learn.\"\n\nElizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the\n\nwhole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this\n\ncomfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as\n\nlikely to marry HER, had she been his relation.\n\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's\n\nperformance, mixing with them many instructions on\n\nexecution and taste. Elizabeth received them with all the\n\nforbearance of civility, and, at the request of the gentlemen,  remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was\n\nready to take them all home.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 32.\n\nElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at\n\nthe door, the certain signal of a visitor. As she had heard no\n\ncarriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and  under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished  letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when\n\nthe door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy,\n\nand Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.\n\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had\n\nunderstood all the ladies were to be within.\n \nThey then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something,\n\nand in this emergence recollecting WHEN she had seen him\n\nlast in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he  would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she\n\nobserved:\n \n\"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last\n\nNovember, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if  I recollect right, he went but the day before. He and his sisters\n\nwere well, I hope, when you left London?\"\n\n\n\n\"Perfectly so, I thank you.\"\n\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer, and,\n\nafter a short pause added:\n\n\"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much\n\nidea of ever returning to Netherfield again?\"\n\n\"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he\n\nmay spend very little of his time there in the future. He has\n\nmany friends, and is at a time of life when friends and\n\nengagements are continually increasing.\"\n\n\"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be\n\nbetter for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place\n\nentirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there.  But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for  the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we\n\nmust expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle.\"\n\n\"I should not be surprised,\" said Darcy, \"if he were to give\n\nit up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.\"\n\nElizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking\n\nlonger of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now\n\ndetermined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.\n\n\n\nHe took the hint, and soon began with, \"This seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal\n\nto it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.\"\n \n\"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have\n\nbestowed her kindness on a more grateful object.\"\n\n\"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a\n\nwife.\"\n \n\"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having  met with one of the very few sensible women who would  have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My\n\nfriend has an excellent understanding--though I am not certain\n\nthat I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing  she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a  prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.\"\n\n\"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so\n\neasy a distance of her own family and friends.\"\n\n\"An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.\"\n\n\"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than\n\nhalf a day's journey. Yes, I call it a VERY easy distance.\"\n\n\"I should never have considered the distance as one of the\n\nADVANTAGES of the match,\" cried Elizabeth. \"I should\n\nnever have said Mrs. Collins was settled NEAR her family.\"\n\n\n\n\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.\n\nAnything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I\n\nsuppose, would appear far.\"\n\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she\n\nanswered:\n \n\"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too  near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and  depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is\n\nfortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant,\n\ndistance becomes no evil. But that is not the case HERE. Mr.\n\nand Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a\n\none as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded\n\nmy friend would not call herself NEAR her family under less\n\nthan HALF the present distance.\"\n\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said,\n\n\"YOU cannot have a right to such very strong local\n\nattachment. YOU cannot have been always at Longbourn.\"\n\nElizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a\n\ncolder voice:\n \n\"Are you pleased with Kent?\"\n\n\n\nA short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the\n\nentrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her\n\nwalk. The tete-a-tete surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the  mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet,  and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to\n\nanybody, went away.\n\n\"What can be the meaning of this?\" said Charlotte, as soon  as he was gone. \"My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you,  or he would never have called us in this familiar way.\"\n\nBut when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very\n\nlikely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after  various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to  proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which\n\nwas the more probable from the time of year. All field sports\n\nwere over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and  a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors;  and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of\n\nthe walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins\n\nfound a temptation from this period of walking thither almost  every day. They called at various times of the morning,  sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then\n\naccompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that\n\nColonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\n\n\n\nbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of  her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in\n\ncomparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness\n\nin Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have\n\nthe best informed mind.\n \nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was\n\nmore difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he\n\nfrequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his  lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity  rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to\n\nhimself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins\n\nknew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam's\n\noccasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was  generally different, which her own knowledge of him could\n\nnot have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this\n\nchange the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend  Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out. She  watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever\n\nhe came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly\n\nlooked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that  look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she\n\noften doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and\n\nsometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind. She had\n\nonce or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his  being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea;  and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject,\n\nfrom the danger of raising expectations which might only end\n\n\n\nin disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a\n\ndoubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could\n\nsuppose him to be in her power.\n\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he certainly admired her,\n\nand his situation in life was most eligible; but, to\n\ncounterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable  patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 33\n\nMore than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was\n\nbrought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to\n\ninform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it\n\ncould occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did,\n\nand even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a\n\nvoluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a\n\nfew formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,  but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk  with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself\n\nthe trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in\n\nthe course of their third rencontre that he was asking some\n\nodd  unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at  Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr.\n\nand Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings\n\nand her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to  expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be  staying THERE too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he\n\nhave Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he\n\nmeant anything, he must mean and allusion to what might  arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite  glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the\n\nParsonage.\n\n\n\nShe was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that\n\nJane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again\n\nsurprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel  Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter  immediately and forcing a smile, she said:\n\n\"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.\"\n\n\"I have been making the tour of the park,\" he replied, \"as I  generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at  the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?\"\n\n\"No, I should have turned in a moment.\"\n\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the\n\nParsonage together.\n\n\"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\" said she.\n\n\"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his\n\ndisposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases.\"\n\n\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he\n\nhas at least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not\n\nknow anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing\n\nwhat he likes than Mr. Darcy.\"\n\n\n\n\"He likes to have his own way very well,\" replied Colonel\n\nFitzwilliam. \"But so we all do. It is only that he has better\n\nmeans of having it than many others, because he is rich, and\n\nmany others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you\n\nknow, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.\"\n\n\"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very\n\nlittle of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of\n\nself-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented  by want of money from going wherever you chose, or  procuring anything you had a fancy for?\"\n\n\"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I\n\nhave experienced many hardships of that nature. But in  matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money.  Younger sons cannot marry where they like.\"\n\n\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think\n\nthey very often do.\"\n\n\"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there\n\nare too many in my rank of life who can afford to marry\n\nwithout some attention to money.\"\n\n\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she  coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively  tone, \"And pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger\n\nson? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you\n\nwould not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\"\n\n\n\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy\n\nher affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said:\n\n\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly  for the sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he  does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.\n\nBut, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as\n\nshe is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage\n\nwhich he must divide with me. I am joined with him in the\n\nguardian ship of Miss Darcy.\"\n\n\"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you  make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young  ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage,\n\nand if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her\n\nown way.\"\n\nAs she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she\n\nsupposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness,\n\nconvinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near\n\nthe truth. She directly replied:\n\n\"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of\n\nher; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in\n\nthe world. She is a very great favourite with some ladies of\n\n\n\nmy acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have\n\nheard you say that you know them.\"\n\n\"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant\n\ngentlemanlike man--he is a great friend of Darcy's.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes,\" said Elizabeth drily; \"Mr. Darcy is\n\nuncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal\n\nof care of him.\"\n \n\"Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy DOES take care  of him in those points where he most wants care. From  something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason\n\nto think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to\n\nbeg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley\n\nwas the person meant. It was all conjecture.\"\n\n\"What is it you mean?\"\n\n\"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be\n\ngenerally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's\n\nfamily, it would be an unpleasant thing.\"\n\n\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\n\n\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing\n\nit to be Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he  congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the  inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without\n\n\n\nmentioning names or any other particulars, and I only  suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of\n\nyoung man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing\n\nthem to have been together the whole of last summer.\"\n\n\"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\"\n\n\"I understood that there were some very strong objections\n\nagainst the lady.\"\n\n\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\n\n\"He did not talk to me of his own arts,\" said Fitzwilliam,\n\nsmiling. \"He only told me what I have now told you.\"\n\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart\n\nswelling with indignation. After watching her a little,\n\nFitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.\n\n\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,\" said she.\n\n\"Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he\n\nto be the judge?\"\n\n\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\n\n\"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the\n\npropriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own\n\njudgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what  manner his friend was to be happy. But,\" she continued,\n\n\n\nrecollecting herself, \"as we know none of the particulars, it is  not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there\n\nwas much affection in the case.\"\n \n\"That is not an unnatural surmise,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"but it\n\nis a lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very\n\nsadly.\"\n\nThis was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a\n\npicture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an  answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation  talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parson-\n\nage. There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor\n\nleft them, she could think without interruption of all that she  had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people\n\ncould be meant than those with whom she was connected.\n\nThere could not exist in the world TWO men over whom Mr.\n\nDarcy could have such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss\n\nBingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his\n\nown vanity, however, did not mislead him, HE was the cause,  his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had\n\nsuffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a\n\nwhile every hope of happiness for the most affectionate,\n\ngenerous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting\n\nan evil he might have inflicted.\n\n\n\n\"There were some very strong objections against the lady,\"\n\nwere Colonel Fitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections\n\nprobably were, her having one uncle who was a country\n\nattorney, and another who was in business in London.\n\n\"To Jane herself,\" she exclaimed, \"there could be no\n\npossibility of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!-\n\n-her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her\n\nmanners captivating. Neither could anything be urged against  my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities  Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which\n\nhe will probably never each.\" When she thought of her\n\nmother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not  allow that any objections THERE had material weight with  Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a\n\ndeeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's\n\nconnections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite  decided, at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst  kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley\n\nfor his sister.\n \nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr.\n\nDarcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings,\n\nwhere they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing  that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much  as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr.\n\n\n\nCollins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady\n\nCatherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 34.\n\nWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters\n\nwhich Jane had written to her since her being in Kent. They\n\ncontained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of  past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.  But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want\n\nof that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her\n\nstyle, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at  ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone, had  been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence\n\nconveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it\n\nhad hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's shameful  boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a  keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation\n\nto think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after\n\nthe next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she  should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to  the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.\n\nShe could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without\n\nremembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel\n\nFitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all,\n\nand agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy\n\nabout him.\n\n\n\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by\n\nthe idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had\n\nonce before called late in the evening, and might now come to  inquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished,  and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her\n\nutter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an\n\nhurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her  health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were  better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a\n\nfew moments, and then getting up, walked about the room.\n\nElizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:\n\n\"In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will\n\nnot be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently\n\nI admire and love you.\"\n\nElizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She\n\nstared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered\n\nsufficient encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt,  and had long felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke  well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be\n\ndetailed; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of\n\ntenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of its  being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always  opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which\n\n\n\nseemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was\n\nvery unlikely to recommend his suit.\n\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be\n\ninsensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and  though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at  first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to\n\nresentment by his subsequent language, she lost all\n\ncompassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself  to answer him with patience, when he should have done. He  concluded with representing to her the strength of that\n\nattachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found\n\nimpossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it  would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he  said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a\n\nfavourable answer. He SPOKE of apprehension and anxiety,\n\nbut his countenance expressed real security. Such a  circumstance could only exasperate farther, and, when he\n\nceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said:\n \n\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode\n\nto express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed,  however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that  obligation should be felt, and if I could FEEL gratitude, I\n\nwould now thank you. But I cannot--I have never desired your\n\ngood opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most  unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It  has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will\n\n\n\nbe of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have  long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have\n\nlittle difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation.\"\n\nMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale\n\nwith anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in\n\nevery feature. He was struggling for the appearance of  composure, and would not open his lips till he believed  himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's\n\nfeelings dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness,\n\nhe said:\n \n\"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of\n\nexpecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so\n\nlittle ENDEAVOUR at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of\n\nsmall importance.\"\n\n\"I might as well inquire,\" replied she, \"why with so evident\n\na desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me\n\nthat you liked me against your will, against your reason, and\n\neven against your character? Was not this some excuse for  incivility, if I WAS uncivil? But I have other provocations.  You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against you-\n\nhad they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable,\n\ndo you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept\n\n\n\nthe man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever,\n\nthe happiness of a most beloved sister?\"\n\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed\n\ncolour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without\n\nattempting to interrupt her while she continued:\n\n\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No\n\nmotive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted\n\nTHERE. You dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the world for\n\ncaprice and instability, and the other to its derision for\n\ndisappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the\n\nacutest kind.\"\n \nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was\n\nlistening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by\n\nany feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of\n\naffected incredulity.\n\n\"Can you deny that you have done it?\" she repeated.\n\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied: \"I have no wish\n\nof denying that I did everything in my power to separate my  friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.  Towards HIM I have been kinder than towards myself.\"\n\n\n\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to\n\nconciliate her.\n \n\"But it is not merely this affair,\" she continued, \"on which  my dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my  opinion of you was decided. Your character was unfolded in\n\nthe recital which I received many months ago from Mr.\n\nWickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon\n\nothers?\"\n \n\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,\"\n\nsaid Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened\n\ncolour.\n \n\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help\n\nfeeling an interest in him?\"\n\n\"His misfortunes!\" repeated Darcy contemptuously; \"yes,\n\nhis misfortunes have been great indeed.\"\n\n\"And of your infliction,\" cried Elizabeth with energy.\n\n\"You have reduced him to his present state of poverty-comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages  which you must know to have been designed for him. You\n\nhave deprived the best years of his life of that independence\n\nwhich was no less his due than his desert. You have done all\n\n\n\nthis! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with\n\ncontempt and ridicule.\"\n\n\"And this,\" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps\n\nacross the room, \"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation  in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully.  My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But\n\nperhaps,\" added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards\n\nher, \"these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your  pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that  had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\n\nbitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with\n\ngreater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into  the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed  inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But\n\ndisguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of\n\nthe feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you  expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?--to  congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition\n\nin life is so decidedly beneath my own?\"\n\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she\n\nsaid:\n \n\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the\n\nmode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than\n\n\n\nas it spared the concern which I might have felt in refusing\n\nyou, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.\"\n\nShe saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she\n\ncontinued:\n \n\"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any\n\npossible way that would have tempted me to accept it.\"\n\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her\n\nwith an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.\n\nShe went on:\n \n\"From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may\n\nalmost say--of my acquaintance with you, your manners,\n\nimpressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your  conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others,  were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on\n\nwhich succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike;\n\nand I had not known you a month before I felt that you were  the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on  to marry.\"\n\n\"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly\n\ncomprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed  of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up  so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your\n\nhealth and happiness.\"\n\n\n\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and\n\nElizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and\n\nquit the house.\n\nThe tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness\n\nsat down and cried for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she\n\nreflected on what had passed, was increased by every review\n\nof it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr.  Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for so many  months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all\n\nthe objections which had made him prevent his friend's\n\nmarrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal  force in his own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying  to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his\n\npride, his abominable pride--his shameless avowal of what he\n\nhad done with respect to Jane--his unpardonable assurance in  acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the  unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham,\n\nhis cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon\n\novercame the pity which the consideration of his attachment  had for a moment excited. She continued in very agitated  reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made\n\nher feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's\n\nobservation, and hurried her away to her room.\n\n\n\nChapter 35.\n\nElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened;\n\nit was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally\n\nindisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast,  to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding  directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr.\n\nDarcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of\n\nentering the park, she turned up the lane, which led farther  from the turn-pike-road. The park paling was still the  boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates\n\ninto the ground.\n\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park. The five weeks which\n\nshe had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the\n\ncountry, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early  trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she  caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove\n\nwhich edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of\n\nits being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the  person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and  stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She\n\nhad turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a\n\nvoice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again\n\n\n\ntowards the gate. He had by that time reached it also, and,  holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a\n\nlook of haughty composure, \"I have been walking in the grove\n\nsome time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the  honour of reading that letter?\" And then, with a slight bow,  turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.\n\nWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest\n\ncuriosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still  increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two  sheets of letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close\n\nhand. The envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way\n\nalong the lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings,\n\nat eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:-\n\n\"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the\n\napprehension of its containing any repetition of those\n\nsentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so  disgusting to you. I write without any intention of paining  you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for\n\nthe happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\n\neffort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must  occasion, should have been spared, had not my character  required it to be written and read. You must, therefore, pardon\n\nthe freedom with which I demand your attention; your\n\nfeelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of\n\nyour justice.\n\n\n\n\"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means\n\nof equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first\n\nmentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I\n\nhad detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that\n\nI had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and\n\nhumanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the\n\nprospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have\n\nthrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged  favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any  other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been\n\nbrought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to\n\nwhich the separation of two young persons, whose affection  could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no  comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was\n\nlast night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance,\n\nI shall hope to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am under\n\nthe necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to\n\nyours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be\n\nobeyed, and further apology would be absurd.\n\n\"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in\n\ncommon with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister\n\nto any other young woman in the country. But it was not till  the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any  apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often\n\nseen him in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of\n\n\n\ndancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William  Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to\n\nyour sister had given rise to a general expectation of their\n\nmarriage. He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time  alone could be undecided. From that moment I observed my  friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that\n\nhis partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever\n\nwitnessed in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and\n\nmanners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but  without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained\n\nconvinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she\n\nreceived his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them  by any participation of sentiment. If YOU have not been  mistaken here, _I_ must have been in error. Your superior\n\nknowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. If it\n\nbe so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on  her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall  not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's\n\ncountenance and air was such as might have given the most\n\nacute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper,  her heart was not likely to be easily touched. That I was  desirous of believing her indifferent is certain--but I will\n\nventure to say that my investigation and decisions are not\n\nusually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe her  to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial  conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to\n\nthe marriage were not merely those which I last night\n\nacknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put\n\n\n\naside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so  great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other\n\ncauses of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and\n\nexisting to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself  endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately  before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The\n\nsituation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was\n\nnothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so  frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your  three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father.\n\nPardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your\n\nconcern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your  displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you  consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so\n\nas to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less\n\ngenerally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than it is  honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only  say farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of\n\nall parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened\n\nwhich could have led me before, to preserve my friend from  what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left  Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am\n\ncertain, remember, with the design of soon returning.\n\n\"The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters'  uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our  coincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike\n\nsensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother,\n\n\n\nwe shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We  accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office of\n\npointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I\n\ndescribed, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this  remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his  determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have\n\nprevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the\n\nassurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's\n\nindifference. He had before believed her to return his affection\n\nwith sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great\n\nnatural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my\n\njudgement than on his own. To convince him, therefore, that  he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point. To  persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that\n\nconviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a\n\nmoment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much.  There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on\n\nwhich I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I\n\ncondescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal\n\nfrom him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as it  was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet  ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill\n\nconsequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not\n\nappear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without  some danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was\n\nbeneath me; it is done, however, and it was done for the best.\n\nOn this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology\n\nto offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it was\n\n\n\nunknowingly done and though the motives which governed  me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not\n\nyet learnt to condemn them.\n\n\"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of  having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying  before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of\n\nwhat he has PARTICULARLY accused me I am ignorant; but\n\nof the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one\n\nwitness of undoubted veracity.\n\n\"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who\n\nhad for many years the management of all the Pemberley\n\nestates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust  naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on  George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was\n\ntherefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at\n\nschool, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important  assistance, as his own father, always poor from the  extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him\n\na gentleman's education. My father was not only fond of this\n\nyoung man's society, whose manner were always engaging; he  had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church  would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As\n\nfor myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think\n\nof him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities-the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the  knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation\n\n\n\nof a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who  had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which\n\nMr. Darcy could not have. Here again shall give you pain--to\n\nwhat degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the  sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of  their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real\n\ncharacter--it adds even another motive.\n \n\"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his  attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in  his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his\n\nadvancement in the best manner that his profession might al-\n\nlow--and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family  living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was  also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not\n\nlong survive mine, and within half a year from these events,\n\nMr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate\n\npecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he\n\ncould not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of\n\nstudying law, and I must be aware that the interest of one  thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.\n\nI rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but, at any\n\nrate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. I knew that  Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the business was  therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance in\n\nthe church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation\n\n\n\nto receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds.  All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought\n\ntoo ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society\n\nin town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying  the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all  restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For\n\nabout three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of\n\nthe incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,  he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His  circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in\n\nbelieving it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a\n\nmost unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on  being ordained, if I would present him to the living in  question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he\n\nwas well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and\n\nI could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it. His resentment\n\nwas in proportion to the distress of his circumstances--and he\n\nwas doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his\n\nreproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of  acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last\n\nsummer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.\n\n\"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish\n\nto forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present  should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said\n\nthus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is\n\n\n\nmore than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of  my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About\n\na year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment\n\nformed for her in London; and last summer she went with the\n\nlady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went  Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to\n\nhave been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.\n\nYounge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart\n\nretained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child,\n\nthat she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to  consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must  be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to\n\nadd, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them\n\nunexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and  then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and  offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,\n\nacknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt\n\nand how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings  prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham,  who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of\n\ncourse removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham's chief object\n\nwas unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty  thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of  revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His\n\nrevenge would have been complete indeed.\n\n\n\n\"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in\n\nwhich we have been concerned together; and if you do not\n\nabsolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me\n\nhenceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in  what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed  on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at.\n\nIgnorant as you previously were of everything concerning\n\neither, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion\n\ncertainly not in your inclination.\n\n\"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you\n\nlast night; but I was not then master enough of myself to\n\nknow what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of  everything here related, I can appeal more particularly to the  testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near\n\nrelationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of\n\nthe executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably  acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If your  abhorrence of ME should make MY assertions valueless, you\n\ncannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my\n\ncousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting  him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this  letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only\n\nadd, God bless you.\n\n\"FITZWILLIAM DARCY\"\n\n\n\nChapter 36.\n\nIf Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may\n\nwell be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and\n\nwhat a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she  read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she  first understand that he believed any apology to be in his\n\npower; and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have\n\nno explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not  conceal. With a strong prejudice against everything he might  say, she began his account of what had happened at\n\nNetherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her\n\npower of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing  what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of  attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of\n\nher sister's insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and\n\nhis account of the real, the worst objections to the match,  made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He  expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her;\n\nhis style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and\n\ninsolence.\n \nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.\n\nWickham--when she read with somewhat clearer attention a\n\nrelation of events which, if true, must overthrow every\n\ncherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an\n\n\n\naffinity to his own history of himself--her feelings were yet  more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\n\nAstonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.\n\nShe wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming,  \"This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!\"-and when she had gone through the whole letter,\n\nthough scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put\n\nit hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that\n\nshe would never look in it again.\n\nIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could\n\nrest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a\n\nminute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as  well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of\n\nall that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as\n\nto examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of his\n\nconnection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he  had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,  though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally\n\nwell with his own words. So far each recital confirmed the\n\nother; but when she came to the will, the difference was great.  What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her  memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible\n\nnot to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\n\nother; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her\n\nwishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the\n\nclosest attention, the particulars immediately following of\n\nWickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his\n\n\n\nreceiving in lieu so consider able a sum as three thousand  pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the\n\nletter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\n\nimpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement-but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion.  Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the\n\naffair, which she had believed it impossible that any\n\ncontrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy's  conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which  must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.\n\nThe extravagance and general profligacy which he\n\nscrupled not to lay at Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly  shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its  injustice. She had never heard of him before his entrance into\n\nthe ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the\n\npersuasion of the young man who, on meeting him  accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance.  Of his former way of life nothing had been known in\n\nHertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real\n\ncharacter, had information been in her power, she had never  felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner  had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.\n\nShe tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some\n\ndistinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might  rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the  predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under\n\nwhich she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had\n\n\n\ndescribed as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance.\n\nBut no such recollection befriended her. She could see him\n\ninstantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she\n\ncould remember no more substantial good than the general  approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his  social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on\n\nthis point a considerable while, she once more continued to\n\nread. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on  Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had  passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the\n\nmorning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of\n\nevery particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself--from whom  she had previously received the information of his near\n\nconcern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had\n\nno reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on\n\napplying to him, but the idea was checked by the  awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly  banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have\n\nhazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of\n\nhis cousin's corroboration.\n \nShe perfectly remembered everything that had passed in\n\nconversation between Wickham and herself, in their first\n\nevening at Mr. Phillips's. Many of his expressions were still\n\nfresh in her memory. She was NOW struck with the  impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and  wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of\n\nputting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency\n\n\n\nof his professions with his conduct. She remembered that he  had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr.\n\nDarcy might leave the country, but that HE should stand his\n\nground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next  week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family  had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\n\nherself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere\n\ndiscussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking  Mr. Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect  for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.\n\nHow differently did everything now appear in which he\n\nwas concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the  consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the  mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of\n\nhis wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. His\n\nbehaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive;\n\nhe had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had  been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference\n\nwhich she believed she had most incautiously shown. Every\n\nlingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in  farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow Mr.  Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his\n\nblamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were\n\nhis manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\n\nacquaintance-an acquaintance which had latterly brought them  much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways-\n\n-seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust-\n\n\n\n-anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits; that  among his own connections he was esteemed and valued--that\n\neven Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that\n\nshe had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as  to prove him capable of SOME amiable feeling; that had his  actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a\n\nviolation of everything right could hardly have been\n\nconcealed from the world; and that friendship between a  person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley,  was incomprehensible.\n\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy\n\nnor Wickham could she think without feeling she had been\n\nblind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.\n\n\"How despicably I have acted!\" she cried; \"I, who have\n\nprided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself\n\non my abilities! who have often disdained the generous  candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or  blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this discovery! Yet,\n\nhow just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have\n\nbeen more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been  my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by  the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our\n\nacquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance,\n\nand driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till\n\nthis moment I never knew myself.\"\n\n\n\nFrom herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr.\n\nDarcy's explanation THERE had appeared very insufficient,\n\nand she read it again. Widely different was the effect of a  second perusal. How could she deny that credit to his  assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to give\n\nin the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of\n\nher sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering  what Charlotte's opinion had always been. Neither could she  deny the justice of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane's\n\nfeelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there\n\nwas a constant complacency in her air and manner not often\n\nunited with great sensibility.\n\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her\n\nfamily were mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet\n\nmerited reproach, her sense of shame was severe. The justice  of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the  circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having\n\npassed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first\n\ndisapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on\n\nhis mind than on hers.\n \nThe compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It\n\nsoothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which\n\nhad thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as  she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the  work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the\n\n\n\ncredit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct,  she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known\n\nbefore.\n \nAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way\n\nto   every   variety   of   thought--re-considering   events,  determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as\n\nshe could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue,\n\nand a recollection of her long absence, made her at length\n\nreturn home; and she entered the house with the wish of\n\nappearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing\n\nsuch reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.\n \nShe was immediately told that the two gentlemen from\n\nRosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only\n\nfor a few minutes, to take leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam\n\nhad been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her\n\nreturn, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be  found. Elizabeth could but just AFFECT concern in missing  him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no\n\nlonger an object; she could think only of her letter.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 37.\n\nThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr.  Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing\n\nintelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as\n\ntolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy  scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then  hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on\n\nhis return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message\n\nfrom her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to\n\nmake her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.\n\nElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without\n\nrecollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this time\n\nhave been presented to her as her future niece; nor could she  think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation\n\nwould have been. \"What would she have said? how would she\n\nhave behaved?\" were questions with which she amused\n\nherself.\n \nTheir first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.\n\n\"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly,\" said Lady Catherine; \"I\n\nbelieve no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I\n\nam particularly attached to these young men, and know them  to be so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to  go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits\n\ntolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most\n\n\n\nacutely, more, I think, than last year. His attachment to\n\nRosings certainly increases.\"\n\nMr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in\n\nhere, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and\n\ndaughter.\n\nLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet\n\nseemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by\n\nherself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so\n\nsoon, she added:\n \n\"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and\n\nbeg that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very\n\nglad of your company, I am sure.\"\n\n\"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind\n\ninvitation,\" replied Elizabeth, \"but it is not in my power to\n\naccept it. I must be in town next Saturday.\"\n\n\"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.  I expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so  before you came. There can be no occasion for your going so\n\nsoon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another\n\nfortnight.\"\n\n\"But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my\n\nreturn.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother\n\ncan. Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.\n\nAnd if you will stay another MONTH complete, it will be in\n\nmy power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going  there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object  to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of\n\nyou--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I\n\nshould not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you\n\nlarge.\"\n\n\"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide\n\nby our original plan.\"\n\nLady Catherine seemed resigned. \"Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling\n\npost by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive\n\nto send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to  that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly  guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.\n\nWhen my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I\n\nmade a point of her having two men-servants go with her.  Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and  Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a\n\ndifferent manner. I am excessively attentive to all those\n\nthings. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.  Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would  really be discreditable to YOU to let them go alone.\"\n\n\n\n\"My uncle is to send a servant for us.\"\n\n\"Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am\n\nvery glad you have somebody who thinks of these things.\n\nWhere shall you change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.\"\n\nLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting\n\ntheir journey, and as she did not answer them all herself,\n\nattention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky  for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten  where she was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours;\n\nwhenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest\n\nrelief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which  she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant\n\nrecollections.\n \nMr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing\n\nby heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards  its writer were at times widely different. When she  remembered the style of his address, she was still full of\n\nindignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had\n\ncondemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against  herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of  compassion. His attachment excited gratitude, his general\n\ncharacter respect; but she could not approve him; nor could\n\nshe for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest  inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour,\n\n\n\nthere was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the  unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier\n\nchagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented\n\nwith laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain  the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother,  with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible\n\nof the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an\n\nendeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia;  but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,  what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine,\n\nweak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's\n\nguidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and  Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a  hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was\n\nan officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while\n\nMeryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there forever.\n\nAnxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern;\n\nand Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her\n\nformer good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had  lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his  conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the\n\nimplicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous\n\nthen was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every  respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for  happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and\n\nindecorum of her own family!\n\n\n\nWhen to these recollections was added the development of\n\nWickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy\n\nspirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so\n\nmuch affected as to make it almost impossible for her to\n\nappear tolerably cheerful.\n\nTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the\n\nlast week of her stay as they had been at first. The very last\n\nevening was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired  minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them  directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent\n\non the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that\n\nMaria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.\n\nWhen  they  parted,  Lady  Catherine,  with  great\n\ncondescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them\n\nto come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh  exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to\n\nboth.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 38.\n\nOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he\n\ndeemed indispensably necessary.\n\n\"I know not, Miss Elizabeth,\" said he, \"whether Mrs.\n\nCollins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the\n\nhouse without receiving her thanks for it. The favor of your\n\ncompany has been much felt, I assure you. We know how  little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain  manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the\n\nlittle we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull\n\nto a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us  grateful for the condescension, and that we have done  everything in our power to prevent your spending your time\n\nunpleasantly.\"\n\nElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions\n\nshe had received, must make HER feel the obliged. Mr.\n\nCollins was gratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:\n\n\"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed\n\nyour time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best;\n\n\n\nand most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you  to very superior society, and, from our connection with\n\nRosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home\n\nscene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford  visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with  regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of\n\nextraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.\n\nYou see on what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not\n\nthink anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they\n\nare sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.\"\n\nWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth\n\ntried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.\n\n\"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into  Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you  will be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs.\n\nCollins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust\n\nit does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunatebut on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me  assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart\n\nmost cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear\n\nCharlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.  There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of\n\n\n\ncharacter and ideas between us. We seem to have been\n\ndesigned for each other.\"\n\nElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness\n\nwhere that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add,  that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.  She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them\n\ninterrupted by the lady from whom they sprang. Poor\n\nCharlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask\n\nfor compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish\n\nand her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet\n\nlost their charms.\n \nAt length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on,\n\nthe parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.\n\nAfter an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his\n\nbest respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the\n\nkindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his  compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He\n\nthen handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the\n\npoint of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with\n\nsome consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave\n\nany message for the ladies at Rosings.\n\n\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"you will of course wish to have your\n\nhumble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks\n\nfor their kindness to you while you have been here.\"\n\nElizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to\n\nbe shut, and the carriage drove off.\n\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence,\n\n\"it seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet h ow\n\nmany things have happened!\"\n\n\"A great many indeed,\" said her companion with a sigh.\n\n\"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea\n\nthere twice! How much I shall have to tell!\" Elizabeth added\n\nprivately, \"And how much I shall have to conceal!\"\n\nTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford\n\nthey reached Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain\n\na few days.\n\nJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which\n\nthe kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was\n\nto go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure\n\nenough for observation.\n\n\n\nIt was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could\n\nwait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr.\n\nDarcy's proposals. To know that she had the power of\n\nrevealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must,  at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity  she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a\n\ntemptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but\n\nthe state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent\n\nof what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once\n\nentered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating\n\nsomething of Bingley which might only grieve her sister\n\nfurther.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 39.\n\nIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed\n\ninn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they\n\nquickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality,  both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.  These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily\n\nemployed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the\n\nsentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.\n\nAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually\n\naffords, exclaiming, \"Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable\n\nsurprise?\"\n\n\"And we mean to treat you all,\" added Lydia, \"but you\n\nmust lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the\n\nshop out there.\" Then, showing her purchases--\"Look here, I\n\nhave bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I  thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as  soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better.\"\n\nAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with\n\nperfect unconcern, \"Oh! but there were two or three much  uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very\n\ntolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears\n\n\n\nthis summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are\n\ngoing in a fortnight.\"\n\n\"Are they indeed!\" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest\n\nsatisfaction.\n \n\"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so\n\nwant papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be\n\nsuch a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost\n\nanything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things!\n\nOnly think what a miserable summer else we shall have!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" thought Elizabeth, \"THAT would be a delightful\n\nscheme indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good\n\nHeaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!\"\n\n\"Now I have got some news for you,\" said Lydia, as they\n\nsat down at table. \"What do you think? It is excellent newscapital news--and about a certain person we all like!\"\n\nJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter\n\nwas told he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:\n\n\"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You  thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he  often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is\n\nan ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long\n\n\n\nchin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear  Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no\n\ndanger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you!\n\nShe is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay.\n\nWickham is safe.\"\n \n\"And Mary King is safe!\" added Elizabeth; \"safe from a\n\nconnection imprudent as to fortune.\"\n\n\"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\"\n\n\"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\"\n\nsaid Jane.\n \n\"I am sure there is not on HIS. I will answer for it, he\n\nnever cared three straws about her--who could about such a\n\nnasty little freckled thing?\"\n\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of\n\nsuch coarseness of EXPRESSION herself, the coarseness of\n\nthe SENTIMENT was little other than her own breast had\n\nharboured and fancied liberal!\n \nAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage\n\nwas ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party,\n\nwith all their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the  unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were\n\nseated in it.\n\n\n\n\"How nicely we are all crammed in,\" cried Lydia. \"I am\n\nglad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having\n\nanother bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and\n\nsnug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the first  place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went  away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any\n\nflirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a\n\nhusband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid  soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how  ashamed I should be of not being married before three-\n\nandtwenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands,\n\nyou can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.  Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in  it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you;\n\nand then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me!\n\nwe had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel  Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.  Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the\n\nbye, Mrs. Forster and me are SUCH friends!) and so she\n\nasked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so  Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you  think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's\n\nclothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not\n\na soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and  me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her  gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When\n\nDenny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the\n\nmen came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I\n\n\n\nlaughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have  died. And THAT made the men suspect something, and then\n\nthey soon found out what was the matter.\"\n\nWith such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to\n\nLongbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there\n\nwas no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.\n\nTheir reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet\n\nre j  oiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than\n\nonce during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to\n\nElizabeth:\n \n\"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\"\n\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the\n\nLucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various\n\nwere the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was  inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest  daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand\n\ncollecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who\n\nsat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all  to the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder  than any other person's, was enumerating the various\n\npleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Mary,\" said she, \"I wish you had gone with us, for we\n\nhad such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the\n\nblinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I\n\nshould have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick;  and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very  handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold\n\nluncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would\n\nhave treated you too. And then when we came away it was  such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I  was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so merry all\n\nthe way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody\n\nmight have heard us ten miles off!\"\n\nTo this Mary very gravely replied, \"Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would\n\ndoubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.\n\nBut I confess they would have no charms for ME--I should infinitely prefer a book.\"\n\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom\n\nlistened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never\n\nattended to Mary at all.\n\nIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but\n\nElizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said\n\nthat the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before  they were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason\n\n\n\ntoo for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham  again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The\n\ncomfort to HER of the regiment's approaching removal was\n\nindeed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and  once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague\n\nher on his account.\n \nShe had not been many hours at home before she found\n\nthat the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a  hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her  parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the\n\nsmallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the\n\nsame time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though  often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at\n\nlast.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 40.\n\nElizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was\n\nconcerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to\n\nher the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.\n\nDarcy and herself.\n\nMiss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the\n\nstrong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of\n\nElizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should\n\nhave delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to\n\nrecommend them; but still more was she grieved for the\n\nunhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.\n\n\"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,\" said she,\n\n\"and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how\n\nmuch it must increase his disappointment!\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, \"I am heartily sorry for him;  but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive  away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for\n\nrefusing him?\"\n\n\"Blame you! Oh, no.\"\n\n\n\n\"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of\n\nWickham?\"\n \n\"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what\n\nyou did.\"\n\n\"But you WILL know it, when I tell you what happened\n\nthe very next day.\"\n\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its con\n\ntents as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a  stroke was this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone  through the world without believing that so much wickedness\n\nexisted in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in\n\none individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful  to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.  Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error,\n\nand seek to clear the one without involving the other.\n\n\"This will not do,\" said Elizabeth; \"you never will be able  to make both of them good for anything. Take your choice,  but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a\n\nquantity of merit between them; just enough to make one\n\ngood sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty  much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's; but  you shall do as you choose.\"\n\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be\n\nextorted from Jane.\n\n\n\n\"I do not know when I have been more shocked,\" said she.\n\n\"Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr.\n\nDarcy! Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.\n\nSuch a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.\"\n\n\"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by\n\nseeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample  justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned  and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you\n\nlament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a\n\nfeather.\"\n \n\"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness\n\nin his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his\n\nmanner!\"\n \n\"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the  education of those two young men. One has got all the  goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.\"\n\n\"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the\n\nAPPEARANCE of it as you used to do.\"\n\n\"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so\n\ndecided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur\n\nto one's genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of\n\nthat kind. One may be continually abusive without saying\n\n\n\nanything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man\n\nwithout now and then stumbling on something witty.\"\n\n\"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could\n\nnot treat the matter as you do now.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may\n\nsay unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt,\n\nno Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very\n\nweak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I\n\nwanted you!\"\n\n\"How unfortunate that you should have used such v ery\n\nstrong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for\n\nnow they DO appear wholly undeserved.\"\n\n\"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness\n\nis a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been\n\nencouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice.\n\nI want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham's character.\"\n\nMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, \"Surely there\n\ncan be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is\n\nyour opinion?\"\n\n\"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not\n\nauthorised me to make his communication public. On the\n\ncontrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be\n\n\n\nkept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to  undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will\n\nbelieve me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so\n\nviolent, that it would be the death of half the good people in  Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not  equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will\n\nnot signify to anyone here what he really is. Some time hence\n\nit will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their  stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say  nothing about it.\"\n\n\"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might\n\nruin him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has\n\ndone, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not\n\nmake him desperate.\"\n\nThe tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this\n\nconversation. She had got rid of two of the secrets which had  weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing  listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of\n\neither. But there was still something lurking behind, of which\n\nprudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other  half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how  sincerely she had been valued by her friend. Here was\n\nknowledge in which no one could partake; and she was\n\nsensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding  between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last  encumbrance of mystery. \"And then,\" said she, \"if that very\n\n\n\nimprobable event should ever take place, I shall merely be  able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable\n\nmanner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be\n\nmine till it has lost all its value!\"\n \nShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not\n\nhappy. She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley.\n\nHaving never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments\n\noften boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,\n\nand prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and  all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to  check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been\n\ninjurious to her own health and their tranquillity.\n\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" said Mrs. Bennet one day, \"what is your  opinion NOW of this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I  am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told\n\nmy sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that\n\nJane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there's the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no\n\ntalk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I\n\nhave inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know.\"\n\n\n\n\"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any\n\nmore.\"\n \n\"Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to\n\ncome. Though I shall always say he used my daughter  extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it.  Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart;\n\nand then he will be sorry for what he has done.\"\n\nBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such\n\nexpectation, she made no answer.\n\n\"Well, Lizzy,\" continued her mother, soon afterwards,\n\n\"and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well,\n\nwell, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table do they  keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is  half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough. There is\n\nnothing extravagant in THEIR housekeeping, I dare say.\"\n\n\"No, nothing at all.\"\n\n\"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes,\n\nyes. THEY will take care not to outrun their income. THEY\n\nwill never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it\n\ndo them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having  Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as  quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.\"\n\n\"It was a subject which they could not mention before me.\"\n\n\n\n\"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no\n\ndoubt they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they\n\ncan be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so\n\nmuch the better. I should be ashamed of having one that was\n\nonly entailed on me.\"\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 41.\n\nThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping\n\napace. The dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss\n\nBennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia,\n\nwhose own misery was extreme, and who could not\n\ncomprehend such hardheartedness in any of the family.\n\n\"Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to\n\ndo?\" would they often exclaiming the bitterness of woe. \"How\n\ncan you be smiling so, Lizzy?\"\n\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she\n\nremembered what she had herself endured on a similar\n\noccasion, five and-twenty years ago.\n\n\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I cried for two days together when\n\nColonel Miller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.\"\n\n\"I am sure I shall break MINE,\" said Lydia.\n\n\"If one could but go to Brighton!\" observed Mrs. Bennet.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so\n\ndisagreeable.\"\n\n\"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\"\n\n\"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do ME a great deal\n\nof good,\" added Kitty.\n\nSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually\n\nthrough Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by\n\nthem; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt  anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she  been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views\n\nof his friend.\n \nBut the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to\n\nBrighton. This invaluable friend was a very young woman,\n\nand very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and  good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other,  and out of their THREE months' acquaintance they had been\n\nintimate TWO.\n \nThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of  Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to\n\nher sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless\n\necstasy, calling for everyone's congratulations, and laughing\n\n\n\nand talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless  Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as\n\nunreasonable as her accent was peevish.\n\n\"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask ME as well  as Lydia,\" said she, \"Though I am NOT her particular friend. I  have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too,\n\nfor I am two years older.\"\n\nIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and  Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as\n\nin her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death\n\nwarrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and  detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she  could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go.\n\nShe represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general\n\nbehaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the  friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the  probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a\n\ncompanion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater\n\nthan at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:\n\n\"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in\n\nsome public place or other, and we can never expect her to do\n\nit with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as\n\nunder the present circumstances.\"\n\n\n\n\"If you were aware,\" said Elizabeth, \"of the very great\n\ndisadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice\n\nof Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner--nay, which has\n\nalready arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently\n\nin the affair.\"\n \n\"Already arisen?\" repeated Mr. Bennet. \"What, has she\n\nfrightened away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But\n\ndo not be cast down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to  be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret.  Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept\n\naloof by Lydia's folly.\"\n\n\"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent.  It is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now  complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world\n\nmust be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and\n\ndisdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character. Excuse  me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not  take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of\n\nteaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the\n\nbusiness of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of\n\namendment. Her character will be fixed, and she will, at\n\nsixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or\n\nher family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest\n\ndegree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a  tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her  mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal\n\n\n\ncontempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this  danger Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever\n\nLydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled!\n\nOh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?\"\n\nMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject,\n\nand affectionately taking her hand said in reply:\n\n\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you\n\nand Jane are known you must be respected and valued; and\n\nyou will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--\n\nor I may say, three--very silly sisters. We shall have no peace  at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let her go,  then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out\n\nof any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an\n\nobject of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less  importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.\n\nThe officers will find women better worth their notice. Let us\n\nhope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own\n\ninsignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees  worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her\n\nlife.\"\n \nWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but\n\nher own opinion continued the same, and she left him  disappointed and sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to\n\n\n\nincrease her vexations by dwelling on them. She was  confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over\n\nunavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of\n\nher disposition.\n\nHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly\n\nhave found expression in their united volubility. In Lydia's\n\nimagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of  earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the  streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She\n\nsaw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of\n\nthem at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp-its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines,  crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with\n\nscarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw herself seated\n\nbeneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at\n\nonce.\n \nHad she known her sister sought to tear her from such\n\nprospects and such realities as these, what would have been\n\nher sensations? They could have been understood only by her  mother, who might have felt nearly the same. Lydia's going to  Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy\n\nconviction of her husband's never intending to go there\n\nhimself.\n\n\n\nBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very\n\nday of Lydia's leaving home.\n\nElizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.\n\nHaving been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of formal\n\npartiality entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very\n\ngentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a  sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to  herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for\n\nthe inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions\n\nwhich had marked the early part of their acquaintance could  only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her. She  lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the\n\nobject of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she\n\nsteadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained  in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause,  his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be\n\ngratified, and her preference secured at any time by their\n\nrenewal.\n \nOn the very last day of the regiment's remaining at\n\nMeryton, he dined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn;\n\nand so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good\n\nhumour, that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in  which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned  Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three\n\n\n\nweeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with\n\nthe former.\n \nHe looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a\n\nmoment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he  had formerly seen him often; and, after observing that he was  a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him.\n\nHer answer was warmly in his favour. With an air of\n\nindifference he soon afterwards added:\n \n\"How long did you say he was at Rosings?\"\n\n\"Nearly three weeks.\"\n\n\"And you saw him frequently?\"\n\n\"Yes, almost every day.\"\n\n\"His manners are very different from his cousin's.\"\n\n\"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon\n\nacquaintance.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not\n\nescape her. \"And pray, may I ask?--\" But checking himself, he\n\nadded, in a gayer tone, \"Is it in address that he improves? Has  he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?--for I  dare not hope,\" he continued in a lower and more serious tone,\n\n\"that he is improved in essentials.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, no!\" said Elizabeth. \"In essentials, I believe, he is\n\nvery much what he ever was.\"\n\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing\n\nwhether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.  There was a something in her countenance which made him  listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she\n\nadded:\n \n\"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not\n\nmean that his mind or his manners were in a state of\n\nimprovement, but that, from knowing him better, his\n\ndisposition was better understood.\"\n\nWickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minute he was silent, till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and\n\nsaid in the gentlest of accents:\n\n\"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy,  will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he  is wise enough to assume even the APPEARANCE of what is\n\nright. His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to\n\nhimself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such  foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort  of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding,\n\nis merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good\n\nopinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her  has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a\n\n\n\ngood deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the  match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very\n\nmuch at heart.\"\n \nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances,\n\nand she was in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the\n\nevening passed with the APPEARANCE, on his side, of usual  cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish  Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and\n\npossibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.\n\nWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation between her and her family was\n\nrather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed\n\ntears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet  was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,  and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the\n\nopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice\n\nwhich there was every reason to believe would be well  attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself  in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were\n\nuttered without being heard.\n\n\n\nChapter 42.\n\nHad Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated\n\nby youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour\n\nwhich youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman  whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early  in their marriage put and end to all real affection for her.\n\nRespect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and\n\nall his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr.  Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the  disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in\n\nany of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate\n\nfor their folly of their vice. He was fond of the country and of  books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal  enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted,\n\nthan as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his\n\namusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man  would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other  powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will\n\nderive benefit from such as are given.\n\nElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the\n\nimpropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband. She had  always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and\n\ngrateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she\n\nendeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\n\n\n\nbanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal  obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the\n\ncontempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.\n\nBut she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-\n\njudged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,\n\nmight at least have preserved the respectability of his  daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\n\nWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure\n\nshe found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the\n\nregiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before,\n\nand at home she had a mother and sister whose constant\n\nrepinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a\n\nreal gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might\n\nin time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers\n\nof her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose\n\ndisposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to\n\nbe hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of\n\nsuch double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon the\n\nwhole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes been\n\nfound before, that an event to which she had been looking\n\nwith impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the\n\nsatisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently  necessary to name some other period for the commencement  of actual felicity-to have some other point on which her\n\nwishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the\n\n\n\npleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and  prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was\n\nnow the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best\n\nconsolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the\n\ndiscontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and  could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it\n\nwould have been perfect.\n\n\"But it is fortunate,\" thought she, \"that I have something to  wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my  disappointment would be certain. But here, by carrying with\n\nme one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I\n\nmay reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure  realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can  never be successful; and general disappointment is only\n\nwarded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation.\"\n\nWhen Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short. Those to\n\nher mother contained little else than that they were just\n\nreturned from the library, where such and such officers had\n\nattended them, and where she had seen such beautiful\n\nornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown,\n\nor a new parasol, which she would have described more fully,\n\nbut was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster  called her, and they were going off to the camp; and from her  correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be\n\n\n\nlearnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were\n\nmuch too full of lines under the words to be made public.\n\nAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence,\n\nhealth, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at  Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families  who had been in town for the winter came back again, and\n\nsummer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet\n\nwas restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the  middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to  enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise\n\nas to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she\n\nmight be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer  above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious  arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be\n\nquartered in Meryton.\n\nThe time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it,\n\nwhen a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once\n\ndelayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr.\n\nGardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far,\n\nand see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\n\nthe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to  give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and,  according to the present plan, were to go no farther north\n\n\n\nwards than Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be  seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs.\n\nGardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where\n\nshe had formerly passed some years of her life, and where  they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an  object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of\n\nMatlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.\n\nElizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it was her business to be satisfied--and\n\ncertainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.\n\nWith the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner. \"But surely,\" said she, \"I\n\nmay enter his county without impunity, and rob it of a few\n\npetrified spars without his perceiving me.\"\n\nThe period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But\n\nthey did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their\n\nfour children, did at length appear at Longbourn. The  children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger  boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin\n\nJane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense\n\nand sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to\n\n\n\nthem in every way-teaching them, playing with them, and\n\nloving them.\n\nThe Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set\n\noff the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and  amusement. One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness  of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health\n\nand temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance\n\nevery pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might  supply it among themselves if there were disappointments\n\nabroad.\n \nIt is not the object of this work to give a description of\n\nDerbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick,  Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small\n\npart of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town\n\nof Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's former residence,\n\nand where she had lately learned some acquaintance still  remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the\n\nprincipal wonders of the country; and within five miles of\n\nLambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was\n\nsituated. It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile\n\nor two out of it. In talking over their route the evening before,\n\nMrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.\n\nMr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\n\n\n\n\"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you\n\nhave heard so much?\" said her aunt; \"a place, too, with which\n\nso many of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham\n\npassed all his youth there, you know.\"\n\nElizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business\n\nat Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for\n\nseeing it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great\n\nhouses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure\n\nin fine carpets or satin curtains.\n\nMrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. \"If it were merely a\n\nfine house richly furnished,\" said she, \"I should not care about\n\nit myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of\n\nthe finest woods in the country.\"\n\nElizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.\n\nThe possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the\n\nplace, instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at  the very idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly  to her aunt than to run such a risk. But against this there were\n\nobjections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last\n\nresource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family\n\nwere unfavourably answered.\n\nAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the\n\nchambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place?\n\nwhat was the name of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm,  whether the family were down for the summer? A most\n\n\n\nwelcome negative followed the last question--and her alarms  now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\n\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was\n\nrevived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could  readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she  had not really any dislike to the scheme. To Pemberley,\n\ntherefore, they were to go.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 43.\n\nElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a\n\nhigh flutter.\n\nThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide\n\nextent.\n \nElizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw\n\nand admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They  gradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves\n\nat the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased,\n\nand the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House,  situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road  with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone\n\nbuilding, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a\n\nridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some  natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any  artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal nor falsely\n\nadorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place\n\nfor which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had  been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all\n\nof them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt\n\nthat to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\n\n\n\nThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house,\n\nall her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She\n\ndreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On\n\napplying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and  Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\n\nwonder at her being where she was.\n\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They followed her into the dining-\n\nparlour. It was a large, well proportioned room, handsomely\n\nfitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a  window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood,  which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness\n\nfrom the distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of\n\nthe ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the  river, the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the  valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight. As they\n\npassed into other rooms these objects were taking different\n\npositions; but from every window there were beauties to be  seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture  suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw,\n\nwith admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor\n\nuselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real elegance,\n\nthan the furniture of Rosings.\n\n\n\n\"And of this place,\" thought she, \"I might have been\n\nmistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly\n\nacquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might\n\nhave rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as  visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,\"--recollecting herself-\"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost\n\nto me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.\"\n\nThis was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something\n\nvery like regret.\n\nShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her\n\nmaster was really absent, but had not the courage for it. At\n\nlength however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she  turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he  was, adding, \"But we expect him to-morrow, with a large\n\nparty of friends.\" How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own\n\njourney had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\n\nHer aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended,\n\namongst several other miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her\n\naunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it. The housekeeper  came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young  gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been\n\nbrought up by him at his own expense. \"He is now gone into\n\nthe army,\" she added; \"but I am afraid he has turned out very\n\nwild.\"\n\n\n\nMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but\n\nElizabeth could not return it.\n \n\"And that,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the\n\nminiatures, \"is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at\n\nthe same time as the other--about eight years ago.\"\n\n\"I have heard much of your master's fine person,\" said\n\nMrs. Gardiner, looking at the picture; \"it is a handsome face.\n\nBut, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.\"\n\nMrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on\n\nthis intimation of her knowing her master.\n\n\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\"\n\nElizabeth coloured, and said: \"A little.\"\n \n\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman,\n\nma'am?\"\n \n\"Yes, very handsome.\"\n\n\"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery  upstairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.  This room was my late master's favourite room, and these\n\nminiatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond\n\nof them.\"\n\n\n\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being\n\namong them.\n\nMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss\n\nDarcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.\n\n\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\" said\n\nMrs. Gardiner.\n \n\"Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen;\n\nand so accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the  next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a  present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with\n\nhim.\"\n \nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had\n\nevidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.\n\n\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the\n\nyear?\"\n\n\"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may\n\nspend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for\n\nthe summer months.\"\n \n\"Except,\" thought Elizabeth, \"when she goes to\n\nRamsgate.\"\n\n\n\n\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; but I do not know when THAT will be. I do not\n\nknow who is good enough for him.\"\n\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, \"It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you\n\nshould think so.\"\n \n\"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that\n\nknows him,\" replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was  going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment  as the housekeeper added, \"I have never known a cross word\n\nfrom him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was\n\nfour years old.\"\n\nThis was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man\n\nhad been her firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was\n\nawakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her\n\nuncle for saying:\n\n\"There are very few people of whom so much can be said.\n\nYou are lucky in having such a master.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I  could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that  they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured\n\n\n\nwhen they grow up; and he was always the sweetesttempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world.\"\n\nElizabeth almost stared at her. \"Can this be Mr. Darcy?\"\n\nthought she.\n\n\"His father was an excellent man,\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\n \n\"Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just\n\nlike him--just as affable to the poor.\"\n\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects of the pictures, the\n\ndimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in\n\nvain, Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family  prejudice  to  which  he  attributed  her  excessive  commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject;\n\nand she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they\n\nproceeded together up the great staircase.\n\n\"He is the best landlord, and the best master,\" said she,\n\n\"that ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who\n\nthink of nothing but themselves. There is not one of his\n\ntenants or servants but will give him a good name. Some  people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of  it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like\n\nother young men.\"\n\n\n\n\"In what an amiable light does this place him!\" thought\n\nElizabeth.\n \n\"This fine account of him,\" whispered her aunt as they\n\nwalked, \"is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor\n\nfriend.\"\n \n\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\"\n\n\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\"\n\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were\n\ninformed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss\n\nDarcy, who had taken a liking to the room when last at\n\nPemberley.\n\n\"He is certainly a good brother,\" said Elizabeth, as she\n\nwalked towards one of the windows.\n \nMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room. \"And this is always the way with him,\" she added. \"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure\n\nto be done in a moment. There is nothing he would not do for\n\nher.\"\n \nThe picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal\n\nbedrooms, were all that remained to be shown. In the former\n\n\n\nwere many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the  art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had\n\nwillingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in\n\ncrayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\n\nalso more intelligible.\n\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they\n\ncould have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth\n\nwalked in quest of the only face whose features would be  known to her. At last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking  resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as\n\nshe remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at\n\nher. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest  contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the  gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken\n\nin his father's lifetime.\n \nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance. The commendation\n\nbestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature.\n\nWhat praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent\n\nservant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered\n\nhow many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how\n\nmuch of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how\n\nmuch of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that  had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable\n\nto his character, and as she stood before the canvas on which\n\n\n\nhe was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she  thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than\n\nit had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and\n\nsoftened its impropriety of expression.\n\nWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of\n\nthe housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who\n\nmet them at the hall-door.\n \nAs they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also,\n\nand while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the\n\nbuilding, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from\n\nthe road, which led behind it to the stables.\n \nThey were within twenty yards of each other, and so\n\nabrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his\n\nsight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were  overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and  for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly\n\nrecovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to\n\nElizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.\n\nShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his\n\napproach, received his compliments with an embarrassment\n\nimpossible to be overcome. Had his first appearance, or his  resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been\n\n\n\ninsufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr.  Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his\n\nmaster, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\n\naloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and  confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew  not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her\n\nfamily. Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last\n\nparted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her  embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being  found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which\n\nthey continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her\n\nlife. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his  accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his  inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of\n\nher having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a\n\nway, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.\n\nAt length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly\n\nrecollected himself, and took leave.\n\nThe others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was\n\noverpowered by shame and vexation. Her coming there was\n\nthe most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!  How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light  might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had\n\n\n\npurposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she  come? Or, why did he thus come a day before he was\n\nexpected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should\n\nhave been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was  plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted  from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again\n\nover the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so\n\nstrikingly altered--what could it mean? That he should even  speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to  inquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his\n\nmanners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such\n\ngentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did  it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his\n\nletter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to\n\naccount for it.\n \nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were\n\napproaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was\n\nsensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically  to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to  direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\n\ndistinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed\n\non that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be,  where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what at the  moment was passing in his mind--in what manner he thought\n\nof her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still\n\n\n\ndear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt  himself at ease; yet there had been THAT in his voice which\n\nwas not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of\n\npleasure in seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had\n\nnot seen her with composure.\n\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her\n\nabsence of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of\n\nappearing more like herself.\n\nThey entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots\n\nwhere the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander,\n\nwere many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills,  with the long range of woods overspreading many, and  occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a\n\nwish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be\n\nbeyond a walk. With a triumphant smile they were told that it  was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued  the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some\n\ntime, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the\n\nwater, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a  simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it  was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the\n\nvalley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the\n\nstream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood  which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings;  but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their\n\n\n\ndistance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great  walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to\n\nthe carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore,\n\nobliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house  on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but  their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able\n\nto indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so\n\nmuch engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some  trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he  advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner,\n\nthey were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was\n\nquite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr.  Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk  here being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed\n\nthem to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however\n\nastonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than  before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if  he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\n\nshe felt that he would probably strike into some other path.\n\nThe idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost none of his\n\nrecent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as\n\nthey met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not  got beyond the words \"delightful,\" and \"charming,\" when  some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that\n\npraise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously\n\nconstrued. Her colour changed, and she said no more.\n\n\n\nMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of\n\nintroducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility\n\nfor which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly  suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of  some of those very people against whom his pride had\n\nrevolted in his offer to herself. \"What will be his surprise,\"\n\nthought she, \"when he knows who they are? He takes them\n\nnow for people of fashion.\"\n\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as\n\nshe named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at\n\nhim, to see how he bore it, and was not without the\n\nexpectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such  disgraceful companions. That he was SURPRISED by the\n\nconnection was evident; he sustained it, however, with\n\nfortitude, and so far from going away, turned his back with\n\nthem, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner.\n\nElizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It\n\nwas consoling that he should know she had some relations for\n\nwhom there was no need to blush. She listened most\n\nattentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in  every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked\n\nhis intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.\n\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard  Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood,\n\n\n\noffering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle,  and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was\n\nusually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-\n\ninarm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.  Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the  compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment,\n\nhowever, was extreme, and continually was she repeating,\n\n\"Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be\n\nfor ME--it cannot be for MY sake that his manners are thus\n\nsoftened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a\n\nchange as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.\"\n\nAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better\n\ninspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a\n\nlittle alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued  by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm  inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her\n\nhusband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they\n\nwalked on together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke.\n\nShe wished him to know that she had been assured of his\n\nabsence before she came to the place, and accordingly began\n\nby observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--\"for\n\nyour housekeeper,\" she added, \"informed us that you would  certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left  Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately\n\nexpected in the country.\" He acknowledged the truth of it all,\n\n\n\nand said that business with his steward had occasioned his\n\ncoming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with\n\nwhom he had been travelling. \"They will join me early to-\n\nmorrow,\" he continued, \"and among them are some who will  claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\"\n\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts\n\nwere instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's\n\nname had been the last mentioned between them; and, if she\n\nmight judge by his complexion, HIS mind was not very\n\ndifferently engaged.\n\n\"There is also one other person in the party,\" he continued\n\nafter a pause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to  you. Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce  my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?\"\n\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it\n\nwas too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to  it. She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy  might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of\n\nher brother, and, without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it\n\nwas gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him\n\nthink really ill of her.\n\nThey now walked on in silence, each of them deep in\n\nthought. Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible;\n\nbut she was flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his  sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon\n\n\n\noutstripped the others, and when they had reached the  carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile\n\nbehind.\n \nHe then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared\n\nherself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such  a time much might have been said, and silence was very\n\nawkward. She wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an\n\nembargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had  been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale  with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly-\n\nand her patience and her ideas were nearly worn our before\n\nthe tete-a-tete was over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming  up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some  refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each\n\nside with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into\n\nthe carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\n\nwalking slowly towards the house.\n\nThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and\n\neach of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to\n\nanything they had expected. \"He is perfectly well behaved,\n\npolite, and unassuming,\" said her uncle.\n\n\"There IS something a little stately in him, to be sure,\"\n\nreplied her aunt, \"but it is confined to his air, and is not\n\nunbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though\n\nsome people may call him proud, I have seen nothing of it.\"\n\n\n\n\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It\n\nwas more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no\n\nnecessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth\n\nwas very trifling.\"\n\n\"To be sure, Lizzy,\" said her aunt, \"he is not so handsome\n\nas Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance,\n\nfor his features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell\n\nme that he was so disagreeable?\"\n\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that\n\nshe had liked him better when they had met in Kent than\n\nbefore, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this\n\nmorning.\n\n\"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\"\n\nreplied her uncle. \"Your great men often are; and therefore I\n\nshall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind\n\nanother day, and warn me off his grounds.\"\n\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his\n\ncharacter, but said nothing.\n\n\"From what we have seen of him,\" continued Mrs.\n\nGardiner, \"I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor  Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary,\n\nthere is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.\n\nAnd there is something of dignity in his countenance that\n\n\n\nwould not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to  be sure, the good lady who showed us his house did give him\n\na most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud\n\nsometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and THAT in\n\nthe eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.\"\n\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in\n\nvindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave\n\nthem to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that  by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions  were capable of a very different construction; and that his\n\ncharacter was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so\n\namiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In  confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the  pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected,\n\nwithout actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such\n\nas such as might be relied on.\n\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures,\n\nevery idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was\n\ntoo much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the  interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else.  Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they had no\n\nsooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\n\nacquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of\n\na intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.\n\n\n\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends;\n\nand she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of\n\nMr. Darcy's civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 44.\n\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the\n\ninn the whole of that morning. But her conclusion was false;\n\nfor on the very morning after their arrival at Lambton, these  visitors came. They had been walking about the place with  some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to\n\ndress themselves for dining with the same family, when the\n\nsound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a  gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street.  Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what it\n\nmeant, and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her\n\nrelations by acquainting them with the honour which she  expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the  embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the\n\ncircumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the\n\npreceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business.  Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there  was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such\n\na quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While\n\nthese newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the  perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment  increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure;\n\nbut amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the\n\npartiality of the brother should have said too much in her  favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she\n\n\n\nnaturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail\n\nher.\n \nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and\n\nas she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to  compose herself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her  uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\n\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable\n\nintroduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see  that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed  as herself. Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that\n\nMiss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a\n\nvery few minutes convinced her that she was only  exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word  from her beyond a monosyllable.\n\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth;\n\nand, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed,  and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less  handsome than her brother; but there was sense and good\n\nhumour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\n\nunassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find\n\nin her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr.\n\nDarcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such\n\ndifferent feelings.\n\nThey had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had\n\n\n\nbarely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a  visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and\n\nin a moment he entered the room. All Elizabeth's anger\n\nagainst him had been long done away; but had she still felt  any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the  unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on\n\nseeing her again. He inquired in a friendly, though general\n\nway, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same\n\ngood-humoured ease that he had ever done.\n\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less\n\ninteresting personage than to herself. They had long wished to\n\nsee him. The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively  attention. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy\n\nand their niece directed their observation towards each with\n\nan earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from\n\nthose inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least  knew what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they  remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was\n\noverflowing with admiration was evident enough.\n\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to\n\nascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to  compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in\n\nthe latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most\n\nsure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give  pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready,  Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\n\n\n\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of\n\nhis were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy\n\nthat he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice\n\npleased herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he  was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be\n\nimaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to\n\nMiss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his\n\nsister. On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three\n\nlittle circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her  anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not  untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that\n\nmight lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to\n\nher, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in  a tone which had something of real regret, that it \"was a very  long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;\" and,\n\nbefore she could reply, he added, \"It is above eight months.\n\nWe have not met since the 26th of November, when we were\n\nall dancing together at Netherfield.\"\n\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he\n\nafterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by\n\nany of the rest, whether ALL her sisters were at Longbourn.  There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding  remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them\n\nmeaning.\n\n\n\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an\n\nexpression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she\n\nheard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his\n\ncompanions, as convinced her that the improvement of  manners which she had yesterday witnessed however\n\ntemporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one\n\nday. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and  courting the good opinion of people with whom any  intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace--\n\nwhen she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the\n\nvery relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected  their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference,  the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind,\n\nthat she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being\n\nvisible. Never, even in the company of his dear friends at  Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen  him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or\n\nunbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result\n\nfrom the success of his endeavours, and when even the\n\nacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed\n\nwould draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both\n\nof Netherfield as Rosings.\n\nTheir visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs.\n\nGardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before\n\n\n\nthey left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence  which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\n\nreadily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of\n\nknowing how SHE, whom the invitation most concerned, felt  disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away  her head. Presuming however, that this studied avoidance\n\nspoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of\n\nthe proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of  society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to  engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed\n\non.\n \nBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing  Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.\n\nElizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak\n\nof her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some  others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of  considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though\n\nwhile it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager\n\nto be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle  and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their  favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to\n\ndress.\n \nBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's\n\ncuriosity; it was not their wish to force her communication. It  was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr.\n\n\n\nDarcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to interest,\n\nbut nothing to justify inquiry.\n\nOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had\n\nthey drawn his character from their own feelings and his\n\nservant's report, without any reference to any other account,\n\nthe circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not\n\nhave recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\n\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became\n\nsensible that the authority of a servant who had known him  since he was four years old, and whose own manners  indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. Neither\n\nhad anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton\n\nfriends that could materially lessen its weight. They had  nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and  if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a\n\nsmall market-town where the family did not visit. It was\n\nacknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did\n\nmuch good among the poor.\n\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he\n\nwas not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of\n\nhis concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly  understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting\n\n\n\nDerbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr.\n\nDarcy afterwards discharged.\n\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this\n\nevening more than the last; and the evening, though as it  passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her  feelings towards ONE in that mansion; and she lay awake two\n\nwhole hours endeavouring to make them out. She certainly\n\ndid not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she  had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike  against him, that could be so called. The respect created by\n\nthe conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first\n\nunwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be  repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into  somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in\n\nhis favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable\n\na light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above  respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill  which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude; gratitude, not\n\nmerely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well\n\nenough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her  manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations  accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded,\n\nwould avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this\n\naccidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance,  and without any indelicate display of regard, or any  peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were\n\nconcerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and\n\n\n\nbent on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a  man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but\n\ngratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as\n\nsuch its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as  by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly  defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,\n\nshe felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to\n\nknow how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself,  and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she  should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still\n\npossessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.\n\nIt had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for\n\nshe had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be\n\nimitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of  politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be  highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\n\nmorning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased;\n\nthough when she asked herself the reason, she had very little\n\nto say in reply.\n\nMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing\n\nscheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive\n\nengagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at\n\nPemberley before noon.\n\n\n\nChapter 45.\n\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be\n\nto her, and was curious to know with how much civility on\n\nthat lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.\n\nOn reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful\n\nfor summer. Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a\n\nmost refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the  house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which\n\nwere scattered over the intermediate lawn.\n \nIn this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was\n\nsitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady  with whom she lived in London. Georgiana's reception of  them was very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment\n\nwhich, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing\n\nwrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior  the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and  her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.\n\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by\n\na curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as  such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It  was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-\n\nlooking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of\n\n\n\ndiscourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of\n\nthe others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with\n\noccasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried\n\non. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to  join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when  there was least danger of its being heard.\n\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by\n\nMiss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter,\n\nhad they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she\n\nwas not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her  own thoughts were employing her. She expected every  moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.\n\nShe wished, she feared that the master of the house might be\n\namongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she  could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a  quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley's voice,\n\nElizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry\n\nafter the health of her family. She answered with equal\n\nindifference and brevity, and the others said no more.\n\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced\n\nby the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety\n\nof all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till  after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to  Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There\n\n\n\nwas now employment for the whole party--for though they  could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful\n\npyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected\n\nthem round the table.\n \nWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the\n\nappearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on\n\nhis entering the room; and then, though but a moment before  she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to  regret that he came.\n\nHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two\n\nor three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the  river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the  family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner\n\ndid he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly\n\neasy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to  be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she  saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened\n\nagainst them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not\n\nwatch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no\n\ncountenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in  Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her\n\nface whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had\n\nnot yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy  were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance,\n\nexerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he\n\n\n\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and  forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at conversation\n\non either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the\n\nimprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with\n\nsneering civility:\n\n\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed\n\nfrom Meryton? They must be a great loss to YOUR family.\"\n\nIn Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections\n\nconnected with him gave her a moment's distress; but exerting\n\nherself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently  answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While she  spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a\n\nheightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister\n\novercome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had  Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her  beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from\n\nthe hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth\n\nby bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed  her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure  her in Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all\n\nthe follies and absurdities by which some part of her family\n\nwere connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever  reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement. To no  creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible,\n\n\n\nexcept to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her  brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very\n\nwish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their\n\nbecoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a  plan, and without meaning that it should effect his endeavour  to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might\n\nadd something to his lively concern for the welfare of his\n\nfriend.\n \nElizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared\n\nnot approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in\n\ntime, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her  brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected  her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had\n\nbeen designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to\n\nhave fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\n\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending\n\nthem to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings\n\nin criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. But  Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's recommendation  was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err.\n\nAnd he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave\n\nGeorgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss\n\n\n\nBingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\n\n\"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr.\n\nDarcy,\" she cried; \"I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have\n\nknown her again.\"\n\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no\n\nmiraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.\n\n\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I  never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her  complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all\n\nhandsome. Her nose wants character--there is nothing marked\n\nin its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common\n\nway; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called  so fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them.\n\nThey have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all;\n\nand in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without\n\nfashion, which is intolerable.\"\n \nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired\n\nElizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending\n\nherself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing\n\nhim at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she\n\n\n\nexpected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a\n\ndetermination of making him speak, she continued:\n\n\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire,\n\nhow amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty;  and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they  had been dining at Netherfield, 'SHE a beauty!--I should as\n\nsoon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she seemed to\n\nimprove on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\n\none time.\"\n \n\"Yes,\" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no\n\nlonger, \"but THAT was only when I first saw her, for it is\n\nmany months since I have considered her as one of the\n\nhandsomest women of my acquaintance.\"\n\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the\n\nsatisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any\n\npain but herself.\n\nMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred\n\nduring their visit, as they returned, except what had\n\nparticularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of\n\neverybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person  who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his  sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but\n\nhimself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs.\n\nGardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.\n\n\n\nChapter 46.\n\nElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding\n\na letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this\n\ndisappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings\n\nthat had now been spent there; but on the third her repining\n\nwas over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters\n\nfrom her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been\n\nmissent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane\n\nhad written the direction remarkably ill.\n\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves. The one missent must first be attended\n\nto; it had been written five days ago. The beginning contained\n\nan account of all their little parties and engagements, with  such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which  was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave\n\nmore important intelligence. It was to this effect:\n\n\"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has  occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am  afraid of alarming you--be assured that we are all well. What I\n\nhave to say relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve\n\nlast night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel  Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with  one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine\n\nour surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly\n\nunexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on\n\n\n\nboth sides! But I am willing to hope the best, and that his  character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet\n\nI can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over\n\nit) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at  least, for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our  poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How\n\nthankful am I that we never let them know what has been said\n\nagainst him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off  Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not  missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent\n\noff directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten\n\nmiles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him  here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of  their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my\n\npoor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out,\n\nbut I hardly know what I have written.\"\n\nWithout allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this\n\nletter instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost\n\nimpatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later\n\nthan the conclusion of the first.\n \n\"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my\n\nhurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though\n\nnot confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot  answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what  I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be\n\n\n\ndelayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham  and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be\n\nassured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to\n\nfear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came  yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many  hours after the express. Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs. F.\n\ngave them to understand that they were going to Gretna\n\nGreen, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking\n\nthe alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did\n\ntrace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering  that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed  the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known\n\nafter this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I\n\nknow not what to think. After making every possible inquiry\n\non that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire,\n\nanxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns\n\nin Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success--no such\n\npeople had been seen to pass through. With the kindest  concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his  apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I\n\nam sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can\n\nthrow any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very  great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot  think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more\n\neligible for them to be married privately in town than to\n\npursue their first plan; and even if HE could form such a\n\n\n\ndesign against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which  is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?\n\nImpossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not\n\ndisposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head  when I expressed my hopes, and said he fear W. was not a  man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her\n\nroom. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is\n\nnot to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life saw  him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed\n\ntheir attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one\n\ncannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have\n\nbeen spared something of these distressing scenes; but now,  as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your  return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if\n\ninconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have\n\njust told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I  cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as  possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\n\nafraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to\n\nask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel  Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I\n\nam sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow\n\nhim to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and\n\nColonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again tomorrow evening. In such and exigence, my uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will\n\nimmediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his\n\ngoodness.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting\n\nfrom her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow\n\nhim, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as\n\nshe reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr.  Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made  him start, and before he could recover himself to speak, she,\n\nin whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's\n\nsituation, hastily exclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must  leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business  that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.\"\n\n\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more\n\nfeeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not  detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr.  and Mrs. Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go\n\nyourself.\"\n\nElizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and\n\nshe felt how little would be gained by her attempting to  pursue them. Calling back the servant, therefore, she\n\ncommissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made\n\nher almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress\n\nhome instantly.\n\nOn his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support\n\nherself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for\n\nDarcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, \"Let me call your maid. Is\n\n\n\nthere nothing you could take to give you present relief? A\n\nglass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.\"\n\n\"No, I thank you,\" she replied, endeavouring to recover\n\nherself. \"There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well;  I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just  received from Longbourn.\"\n\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few\n\nminutes could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched  suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his  concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length\n\nshe spoke again. \"I have just had a letter from Jane, with such\n\ndreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My  younger sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown  herself into the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off\n\ntogether from Brighton. YOU know him too well to doubt the\n\nrest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that can\n\ntempt him to-she is lost for ever.\"\n\nDarcy was fixed in astonishment. \"When I consider,\" she\n\nadded in a yet more agitated voice, \"that I might have\n\nprevented it! I, who knew what he was. Had I but explained  some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own  family! Had his character been known, this could not have\n\nhappened. But it is all--all too late now.\"\n\n\"I am grieved indeed,\" cried Darcy; \"grieved--shocked.\n\nBut is it certain--absolutely certain?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday nig ht,\n\nand were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are\n\ncertainly not gone to Scotland.\"\n\n\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to\n\nrecover her?\"\n \n\"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg\n\nmy uncle's immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope,\n\nin half-an-hour. But nothing can be done--I know very well  that nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked  on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the\n\nsmallest hope. It is every way horrible!\"\n\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\n\n\"When MY eyes were opened to his real character--Oh!\n\nhad I known what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not-\n\n-I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched\n\nmistake!\"\n \nDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation,\n\nhis brow contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed,\n\nand instantly understood it. Her power was sinking;  everything MUST sink under such a proof of family  weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She\n\ncould neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-\n\nconquest brought nothing to her consolatory to her bosom,\n\n\n\nafforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary,  exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes;\n\nand never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\n\nhim, as now, when all love must be vain.\n \nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.\n\nLydia--the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them\n\nall, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her\n\nface with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to\n\neverything else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was  only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her\n\ncompanion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke\n\ncompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, \"I am afraid you  have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to  plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing\n\nconcern. Would to Heaven that anything could be either said\n\nor done on my part that might offer consolation to such  distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which  may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate\n\naffair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of\n\nseeing you at Pemberley to-day.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy.\n\nSay that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal\n\nthe unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be\n\nlong.\"\n\n\n\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than\n\nthere was at present reason to hope, and leaving his\n\ncompliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting\n\nlook, went away.\n\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it\n\nwas that they should ever see each other again on such terms\n\nof cordiality as had marked their several meetings in  Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the  whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and\n\nvarieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which\n\nwould now have promoted its continuance, and would\n\nformerly have rejoiced in its termination.\n\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection,\n\nElizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable\n\nnor faulty. But if otherwise--if regard springing from such  sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is  so often described as arising on a first interview with its\n\nobject, and even before two words have been exchanged,\n\nnothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given  somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for  Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her\n\nto seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that\n\nas it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early  example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found  additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business.\n\n\n\nNever, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane,\n\nshe thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.\n\nSurprise was the least of her feelings on this development.\n\nWhile the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she\n\nwas all surprise--all astonishment that Wickham should marry\n\na girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and\n\nhow Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared  incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an  attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and\n\nthough she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging\n\nin an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no  difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her  understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\n\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in\n\nHertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes\n\nanother, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them\n\nin her opinion. Her affections had continually been fluctuating  but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and  mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did\n\nshe now feel it!\n \nShe was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother\n\n\n\nincapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and  though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for\n\nLydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost\n\nimportance, and till he entered the room her impatience was\n\nsevere. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm,\n\nsupposing by the servant's account that their niece was taken\n\nsuddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly on that head, she\n\neagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading  the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last  with trembling energy, though Lydia had never been a\n\nfavourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be\n\ndeeply afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it;  and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr.  Gardiner promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth,\n\nthough expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude;\n\nand all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating  to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as  soon as possible.\n\n\"But what is to be done about Pemberley?\" cried Mrs.\n\nGardiner. \"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for\n\nus; was it so?\"\n \n\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our\n\nengagement. THAT is all settled.\"\n\n\n\n\"What is all settled?\" repeated the other, as she ran into her\n\nroom to prepare. \"And are they upon such terms as for her to\n\ndisclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\n\nBut wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had\n\nElizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained\n\ncertain that all employment was impossible to one so\n\nwretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well\n\nas her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be\n\nwritten to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for\n\ntheir sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole\n\ncompleted; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his  account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and  Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself,\n\nin a shorter space of time than she could have supposed,\n\nseated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 47.\n\n\"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\" said her  uncle, as they drove from the town; \"and really, upon serious  consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as\n\nyour eldest sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very\n\nunlikely that any young man should form such a design  against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless,  and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am\n\nstrongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her\n\nfriends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed  again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel  Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the risk!\"\n\n\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up\n\nfor a moment.\n \n\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of\n\nyour uncle's opinion. It is really too great a violation of\n\ndecency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot\n\nthink so very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so\n\nwholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?\"\n\n\"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every\n\nother neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should\n\nbe so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to\n\nScotland if that had been the case?\"\n\n\n\n\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no\n\nabsolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland.\"\n\n\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney\n\ncoach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them\n\nwere to be found on the Barnet road.\"\n \n\"Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may\n\nbe there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more\n\nexceptional purpose. It is not likely that money should be very  abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they  could be more economically, though less expeditiously,\n\nmarried in London than in Scotland.\"\n \n\"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection?  Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not  likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account,\n\nwas persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham\n\nwill never marry a woman without some money. He cannot  afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she  beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him,\n\nfor her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by\n\nmarrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of  disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable  elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing\n\nof the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\n\nother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has  no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my\n\n\n\nfather's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention\n\nhe has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his\n\nfamily, that HE would do as little, and think as little about it,\n\nas any father could do, in such a matter.\"\n\n\"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but\n\nlove of him as to consent to live with him on any terms ot her\n\nthan marriage?\"\n\n\"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\" replied  Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, \"that a sister's sense of  decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But,\n\nreally, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her\n\njustice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to  think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a  twelvemonth-she has been given up to nothing but amusement\n\nand vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the\n\nmost idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions  that came in her way. Since the ----shire were first quartered  in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been\n\nin her head. She has been doing everything in her power by\n\nthinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall  I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally  lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every\n\ncharm of person and address that can captivate a woman.\"\n\n\"But you see that Jane,\" said her aunt, \"does not think so\n\nvery ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\"\n\n\n\n\"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there,\n\nwhatever might be their former conduct, that she would think\n\ncapable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?\n\nBut Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as\n\nfalse and deceitful as he is insinuating.\"\n\n\"And do you really know all this?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner,\n\nwhose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all\n\nalive.\n \n\"I do indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, colouring. \"I told you, the\n\nother day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you  yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he  spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and\n\nliberality towards him. And there are other circumstances\n\nwhich I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate;  but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.  From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared\n\nto see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the\n\ncontrary himself. He must know that she was as amiable and\n\nunpretending as we have found her.\"\n\n\"But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant\n\nof what you and Jane seem so well to understand?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent,\n\nand saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel\n\n\n\nFitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week\n\nor fortnight's time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to\n\nwhom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make  our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be  to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood\n\nhad of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was\n\nsettled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity  of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.  That SHE could be in any danger from the deception never\n\nentered my head. That such a consequence as THIS could\n\nensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my\n\nthoughts.\"\n\n\"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no\n\nreason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?\"\n\n\"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of  affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been  perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on\n\nwhich it could be thrown away. When first he entered the\n\ncorps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all  were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses  about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished\n\nHER by any particular attention; and, consequently, after a\n\nmoderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her  fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who\n\n\n\ntreated her with more distinction, again became her\n\nfavourites.\"\n \n* * * * *\n \nIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could\n\ndetain them from it long, during the whole of the journey.\n\nFrom Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.\n\nThey travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping\n\none night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the  next day. It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane  could not have been wearied by long expectations.\n\nThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were\n\nstanding on the steps of the house as they entered the  paddock; and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the  joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself\n\nover their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was\n\nthe first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\n\nElizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came\n\nrunning down from her mother's apartment, immediately met\n\nher.\n\n\n\nElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether\n\nanything had been heard of the fugitives.\n\n\"Not yet,\" replied Jane. \"But now that my dear uncle is\n\ncome, I hope everything will be well.\"\n\n\"Is my father in town?\"\n\n\"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.\"\n\n\"And have you heard from him often?\"\n\n\"We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on\n\nWednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give\n\nme his directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He\n\nmerely added that he should not write again till he had\n\nsomething of importance to mention.\"\n\n\"And my mother--how is she? How are you all?\"\n\n\"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are\n\ngreatly shaken. She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction  in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room.  Mary and Kitty are, thank Heaven, are quite well.\"\n\n\"But you--how are you?\" cried Elizabeth. \"You look pale.\n\nHow much you must have gone through!\"\n\n\n\nHer sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while\n\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was\n\nnow put an end to by the approach of the whole party. Jane\n\nran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them\n\nboth, with alternate smiles and tears.\n \nWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions\n\nwhich Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by  the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence  to give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the\n\nbenevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her;\n\nshe still expected that it would all end well, and that every  morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her  father, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce\n\ntheir marriage.\n\nMrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes' conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret,\n\ninvectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and\n\ncomplaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming  everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the  errors of her daughter must principally be owing.\n\n\"If I had been able,\" said she, \"to carry my point in going\n\nto Brighton, with all my family, THIS would not have  happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.\n\n\n\nWhy did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for\n\nshe is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been\n\nwell looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to  have the charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am.  Poor dear child! And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I\n\nknow he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him and then\n\nhe will be killed, and what is to become of us all? The\n\nCollinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall\n\ndo.\"\n \nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr.  Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very\n\nnext day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for\n\nrecovering Lydia.\n\n\"Do not give way to useless alarm,\" added he; \"though it is\n\nright to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look\n\non it as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.\n\nIn a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as\n\nI get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him come\n\nhome with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may\n\nconsult together as to what is to be done.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh! my dear brother,\" replied Mrs. Bennet, \"that is\n\nexactly what I could most wish for. And now do, when you\n\nget to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they\n\nare not married already, MAKE them marry. And as for  wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia  she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,\n\nafter they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from\n\nfighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am  frightened out of my wits--and have such tremblings, such  flutterings, all over me-such spasms in my side and pains in\n\nmy head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by\n\nnight nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to give any\n\ndirections about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does\n\nnot know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how\n\nkind you are! I know you will contrive it all.\"\n\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his\n\nearnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid\n\nrecommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her\n\nfear; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was\n\non the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on the\n\nhousekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.\n\nThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there\n\nwas no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family,\n\nthey did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had  not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants,  while they waited at table, and judged it better that ONE only\n\n\n\nof the household, and the one whom they could most trust  should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.\n\nIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and\n\nKitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before. One came from\n\nher books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of both,\n\nhowever, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in\n\neither, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger  which she had herself incurred in this business, had given  more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for\n\nMary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to\n\nElizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:\n\n\"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be\n\nmuch talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour\n\ninto the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly\n\nconsolation.\"\n \nThen, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying,\n\nshe added, \"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may\n\ndraw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female\n\nis irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin;  that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and\n\nthat she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards\n\nthe undeserving of the other sex.\"\n\n\n\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued\n\nto console herself with such kind of moral extractions from\n\nthe evil before them.\n \nIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to\n\nbe for half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly\n\navailed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries,\n\nwhich Jane was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in  general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event,\n\nwhich Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss\n\nBennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former\n\ncontinued the subject, by saying, \"But tell me all and  everything about it which I have not already heard. Give me  further particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no\n\napprehension of anything before the elopement took place?\n\nThey must have seen them together for ever.\"\n\n\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some\n\npartiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him\n\nany alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was\n\nattentive and kind to the utmost. He WAS coming to us, in  order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of  their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first\n\ngot abroad, it hastened his journey.\"\n\n\n\n\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not\n\nmarry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel\n\nForster seen Denny himself?\"\n\n\"Yes; but, when questioned by HIM, Denny denied  knowing anything of their plans, and would not give his real  opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not\n\nmar-rying--and from THAT, I am inclined to hope, he might\n\nhave been misunderstood before.\"\n \n\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you\n\nentertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\"\n\n\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our\n\nbrains? I felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's  happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his  conduct had not been always quite right. My father and\n\nmother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a\n\nmatch it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural  triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's  last letter she had prepared her for such a step. She had\n\nknown, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many\n\nweeks.\"\n \n\"But not before they went to Brighton?\"\n\n\"No, I believe not.\"\n\n\n\n\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham\n\nhimself? Does he know his real character?\"\n \n\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham\n\nas he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and  extravagant. And since this sad affair has taken place, it is  said that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may\n\nbe false.\"\n \n\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we\n\nknew of him, this could not have happened!\"\n\n\"Perhaps it would have been better,\" replied her sister.\n\n\"But to expose the former faults of any person without\n\nknowing what their present feelings were, seemed\n\nunjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.\"\n\n\"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's\n\nnote to his wife?\"\n \n\"He brought it with him for us to see.\"\n\nJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to\n\nElizabeth. These were the contents:\n \n\"MY DEAR HARRIET,\n\n\"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I  cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow\n\n\n\nmorning, as soon as I am missed. I am going to Gretna  Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you\n\na simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love,\n\nand he is an angel. I should never be happy without him,\n\nso think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word\n\nat Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will\n\nmake the surprise the greater, when I write to them and\n\nsign my name 'Lydia Wickham.' What a good joke it will  be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses  to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with\n\nhim to-night. Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he\n\nknows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next\n\nball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my  clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell\n\nSally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown\n\nbefore they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to  Colonel Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey.\n\n\"Your affectionate friend,\n \n\"LYDIA BENNET.\"\n \n\"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\" cried Elizabeth\n\nwhen she had finished it. \"What a letter is this, to be written at\n\nsuch a moment! But at least it shows that SHE was serious on\n\nthe subject of their journey. Whatever he might afterwards\n\npersuade her to, it was not on her side a SCHEME of infamy.\n\nMy poor father! how he must have felt it!\"\n\n\n\n\"I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a  word for full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill\n\nimmediately, and the whole house in such confusion!\"\n\n\"Oh! Jane,\" cried Elizabeth, \"was there a servant belonging  to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the  day?\"\n\n\"I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at\n\nsuch a time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and  though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my  power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done!\n\nBut the horror of what might possibly happen almost took\n\nfrom me my faculties.\"\n\n\"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you.\n\nYou do not look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have\n\nhad every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.\"\n\n\"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have  shared in every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right  for either of them. Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary\n\nstudies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken\n\nin on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after  my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday  with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And Lady\n\nLucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday\n\nmorning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any\n\nof her daughters', if they should be of use to us.\"\n\n\n\n\"She had better have stayed at home,\" cried Elizabeth;\n\n\"perhaps she MEANT well, but, under such a misfortune as\n\nthis, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours. Assistance\n\nis impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over\n\nus at a distance, and be satisfied.\"\n \nShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her\n\nfather had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery\n\nof his daughter.\n\n\"He meant I believe,\" replied Jane, \"to go to Epsom, the\n\nplace where they last changed horses, see the postilions and\n\ntry if anything could be made out from them. His principal\n\nobject must be to discover the number of the hackney coach  which took them from Clapham. It had come with a fare from  London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a\n\ngentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another\n\nmight be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If  he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had  before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries\n\nthere, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the\n\nstand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other  designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be  gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had\n\ndifficulty in finding out even so much as this.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 48.\n\nThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him. His family knew him to be, on all\n\ncommon occasions, a most negligent and dilatory\n\ncorrespondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.  They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing  intelligence to send; but even of THAT they would have been\n\nglad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters\n\nbefore he set off.\n \nWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle\n\npromised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to\n\nLongbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.\n\nMrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in\n\nHertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to\n\nthem in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also visited\n\nthem frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of  cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came  without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's\n\nextravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without\n\nleaving them more dispirited than she found them.\n\n\n\nAll Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light. He\n\nwas declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place,\n\nand his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had  been extended into every tradesman's family. Everybody  declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;\n\nand everybody began to find out that they had always\n\ndistrusted the appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though\n\nshe did not credit above half of what was said, believed\n\nenough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin more\n\ncertain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became\n\nalmost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come  when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never  before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have\n\ngained some news of them.\n\nMr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his\n\nwife received a letter from him; it told them that, on his\n\narrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and\n\npersuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street; that Mr.\n\nBennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in\n\ntown, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone\n\nto one of them, on their first coming to London, before they  procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any  success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it,\n\nhe meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.\n\n\n\nBennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again very soon. There was also a\n\npostscript to this effect:\n\n\"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out,\n\nif possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the  regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections\n\nwho would be likely to know in what part of town he has now\n\nconcealed himself. If there were anyone that one could apply  to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be  of essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide\n\nus. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his\n\npower to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts,  perhaps, Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living,  better than any other person.\"\n\nElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this\n \ndeference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her  power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as  the compliment deserved. She had never heard of his having\n\nhad any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom\n\nhad been dead many years. It was possible, however, that  some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to give  more information; and though she was not very sanguine in\n\nexpecting it, the application was a something to look forward\n\nto.\n\n\n\nEvery day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.\n\nThe arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning's\n\nimpatience. Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to  be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day  was expected to bring some news of importance.\n\nBut before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter\n\narrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr.  Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that  came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and\n\nElizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were,\n\nlooked over her, and read it likewise. It was as follows:\n \n\"MY DEAR SIR,\n \n\"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my\n\nsituation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction\n\nyou are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday  informed by a letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear  sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with\n\nyou and all your respectable family, in your present distress,\n\nwhich must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from  a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be  wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--\n\nor that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of\n\nall others the most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of  your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of\n\n\n\nthis. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason\n\nto suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this\n\nlicentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded\n\nfrom a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,  for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined  to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she\n\ncould not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age.\n\nHowsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have\n\nrelated the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that\n\nthis false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes  of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself  condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a\n\nfamily? And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect,\n\nwith augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last\n\nNovember; for had it been otherwise, I must have been\n\ninvolved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise\n\nyou, dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to\n\nthrow off your unworthy child from your affection for ever,\n\nand leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense.\n\n\"I am, dear sir, etc., etc.\"\n \nMr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an\n\nanswer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a  pleasant nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a  single relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and\n\nit was certain that he had no near one living. His former\n\n\n\nacquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in  the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular\n\nfriendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who\n\ncould be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in  the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very  powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of\n\ndiscovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he\n\nhad left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable\n\namount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand\n\npounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.\n\nHe owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were\n\nstill more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal  these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them  with horror. \"A gamester!\" she cried. \"This is wholly\n\nunexpected. I had not an idea of it.\"\n\nMr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was  Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their\n\nendeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's entreaty\n\nthat he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do  whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for  continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this,\n\nshe did not express so much satisfaction as her children\n\nexpected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been\n\nbefore.\n\n\n\n\"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\" she\n\ncried. \"Sure he will not leave London before he has found\n\nthem. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if\n\nhe comes away?\"\n\nAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the\n\nsame time that Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore,\n\ntook them the first stage of their journey, and brought its\n\nmaster back to Longbourn.\n\nMrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about\n\nElizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her\n\nfrom that part of the world. His name had never been  voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind  of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their\n\nbeing followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.\n\nElizabeth had received none since her return that could come\n\nfrom Pemberley.\n\nThe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other\n\nexcuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing,\n\ntherefore, could be fairly conjectured from THAT, though  Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted  with her own feelings, was perfectly aware that, had she\n\nknown nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of\n\nLydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.\n\n\n\nWhen Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever\n\nbeen in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business\n\nthat had taken him away, and it was some time before his\n\ndaughters had courage to speak of it.\n\nIt was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at\n\ntea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then,\n\non her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have  endured, he replied, \"Say nothing of that. Who should suffer  but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.\"\n\n\"You must not be too severe upon yourself,\" replied\n\nElizabeth.\n \n\"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human\n\nnature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my\n\nlife feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of\n\nbeing overpowered by the impression. It will pass away soon\n\nenough.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose them to be in London?\"\n\n\"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?\"\n\n\"And Lydia used to want to go to London,\" added Kitty.\n\n\"She is happy then,\" said her father drily; \"and her\n\nresidence there will probably be of some duration.\"\n\n\n\nThen after a short silence he continued:\n \n\"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your\n\nadvice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows\n\nsome greatness of mind.\"\n\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch\n\nher mother's tea.\n \n\"This is a parade,\" he cried, \"which does one good; it gives\n\nsuch an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the  same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering  gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may\n\ndefer it till Kitty runs away.\"\n\n\"I am not going to run away, papa,\" said Kitty fretfully. \"If  I should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than  Lydia.\"\n\n\"YOU go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as\n\nEastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through\n\nthe village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you\n\nstand up with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out  of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of  every day in a rational manner.\"\n\n\n\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to\n\ncry.\n \n\"Well, well,\" said he, \"do not make yourself unhappy. If\n\nyou are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a\n\nreview at the end of them.\"\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 49.\n\nTwo days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding\n\nthat she came to call them to their mother, went forward to\n\nmeet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they  approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, \"I beg your pardon,  madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might\n\nhave got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of\n\ncoming to ask.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from\n\ntown.\"\n \n\"Dear madam,\" cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment,\n\n\"don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr.\n\nGardiner? He has been here this half-hour, and master has had\n\na letter.\"\n \nAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for\n\nspeech. They ran through the vestibule into the breakfastroom; from thence to the library; their father was in neither;  and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their\n\nmother, when they were met by the butler, who said:\n\n\"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking\n\ntowards the little copse.\"\n\n\n\nUpon this information, they instantly passed through the\n\nhall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who\n\nwas deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on\n\none side of the paddock.\n\nJane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister,\n\npanting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:\n\n\"Oh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from\n\nmy uncle?\"\n\n\"Yes I have had a letter from him by express.\"\n\n\"Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?\"\n\n\"What is there of good to be expected?\" said he, taking the\n\nletter from his pocket. \"But perhaps you would like to read it.\"\n\nElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now\n\ncame up.\n \n\"Read it aloud,\" said their father, \"for I hardly know\n\nmyself what it is about.\"\n\n\"Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.\n\n\"MY DEAR BROTHER,\n\n\n\n\"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece,\n\nand such as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you\n\nsatisfaction. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was\n\nfortunate enough to find out in what part of London they  were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to  know they are discovered. I have seen them both--\"\n\n\"Then it is as I always hoped,\" cried Jane; \"they are\n\nmarried!\"\n \nElizabeth read on:\n \n\"I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I\n\nfind there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing\n\nto perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on  your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is  required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement,\n\nher equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among\n\nyour children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,  moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during  your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are\n\nconditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation\n\nin complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for  you. I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in  bringing me your answer. You will easily comprehend, from\n\nthese particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so\n\nhopeless as they are generally believed to be. The world has  been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there will\n\n\n\nbe some little money, even when all his debts are discharged,  to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I\n\nconclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in\n\nyour name throughout the whole of this business, I will  immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a  proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for\n\nyour coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn,\n\nand depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer  as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have  judged it best that my niece should be married from this\n\nhouse, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-\n\nday. I shall write again as soon as anything more is\n\ndetermined on. Yours, etc.,\n \n\"EDW. GARDINER.\"\n \n\"Is it possible?\" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.\n\n\"Can it be possible that he will marry her?\"\n\n\"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought\n\nhim,\" said her sister. \"My dear father, I congratulate you.\"\n\n\"And have you answered the letter?\" cried Elizabeth.\n\n\"No; but it must be done soon.\"\n \nMost earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more\n\ntime before he wrote.\n\n\n\n\"Oh! my dear father,\" she cried, \"come back and write\n\nimmediately. Consider how important every moment is in\n\nsuch a case.\"\n \n\"Let me write for you,\" said Jane, \"if you dislike the\n\ntrouble yourself.\"\n\n\"I dislike it very much,\" he replied; \"but it must be done.\"\n\nAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked\n\ntowards the house.\n \n\"And may I ask--\" said Elizabeth; \"but the terms, I\n\nsuppose, must be complied with.\"\n\n\"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so\n\nlittle.\"\n \n\"And they MUST marry! Yet he is SUCH a man!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be\n\ndone. But there are two things that I want very much to know;\n\none is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it\n\nabout; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.\"\n\n\"Money! My uncle!\" cried Jane, \"what do you mean, sir?\"\n\n\n\n\"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on\n\nso slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life,\n\nand fifty after I am gone.\"\n\n\"That is very true,\" said Elizabeth; \"though it had not  occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and  something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings!\n\nGenerous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A\n\nsmall sum could not do all this.\"\n \n\"No,\" said her father; \"Wickham's a fool if he takes her\n\nwith a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be\n\nsorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our\n\nrelationship.\"\n\n\"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a\n\nsum to be repaid?\"\n\nMr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in\n\nthought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their  father then went on to the library to write, and the girls\n\nwalked into the breakfast-room.\n \n\"And they are really to be married!\" cried Elizabeth, as\n\nsoon as they were by themselves. \"How strange this is! And  for THIS we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small  as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his\n\ncharacter, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!\"\n\n\n\n\"I comfort myself with thinking,\" replied Jane, \"that he\n\ncertainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for\n\nher. Though our kind uncle has done something towards\n\nclearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or\n\nany thing like it, has been advanced. He has children of his  own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten\n\nthousand pounds?\"\n\n\"If he were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have\n\nbeen,\" said Elizabeth, \"and how much is settled on his side on\n\nour sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done\n\nfor them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The\n\nkindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their  taking her home, and affording her their personal protection  and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years\n\nof gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is\n\nactually with them! If such goodness does not make her  miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a  meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!\"\n\n\"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either\n\nside,\" said Jane: \"I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His  consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is  come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will\n\nsteady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly,\n\nand live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their\n\npast imprudence forgotten.\"\n\n\n\n\"Their conduct has been such,\" replied Elizabeth, \"as\n\nneither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to\n\ntalk of it.\"\n \nIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father whether\n\nhe would not wish them to make it known to her. He was\n\nwriting and, without raising his head, coolly replied:\n\n\"Just as you please.\"\n\n\"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?\"\n\n\"Take whatever you like, and get away.\"\n\nElizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs.\n\nBennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all. After\n\na slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.\n\nMrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its\n\nexuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from\n\ndelight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation.  To know that her daughter would be married was enough. She  was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any\n\nremembrance of her misconduct.\n\n\n\n\"My dear, dear Lydia!\" she cried. \"This is delightful\n\nindeed! She will be married! I shall see her again! She will be\n\nmarried at sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it\n\nwould be. I knew he would manage everything! How I long to\n\nsee her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the\n\nwedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them\n\ndirectly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him\n\nhow much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring  the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment.  My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we shall be together when\n\nwe meet!\"\n \nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all\n\nunder.\n \n\"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,\" she added,  \"in a great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he  has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.\"\n\n\"Well,\" cried her mother, \"it is all very right; who should\n\ndo it but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own,  I and my children must have had all his money, you know;  and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him,\n\nexcept a few presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I\n\nshall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it  sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I\n\n\n\nam in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will\n\ndictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your father\n\nabout the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered\n\nimmediately.\"\n\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some\n\nvery plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some\n\ndifficulty, persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to  be consulted. One day's delay, she observed, would be of  small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite\n\nso obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.\n\n\"I will go to Meryton,\" said she, \"as soon as I am dressed,  and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I  come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty,\n\nrun down and order the carriage. An airing would do me a\n\ngreat deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you  in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you  heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and\n\nyou shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her\n\nwedding.\"\n\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick\n\nof this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might\n\nthink with freedom.\n\n\n\nPoor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but\n\nthat it was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it\n\nso; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness\n\nnor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister,  in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago,  she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 50.\n\nMr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of\n\nhis wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than\n\never. Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not\n\nhave been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or\n\ncredit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of\n\nprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great\n\nBritain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place. He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense\n\nof his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to\n\nfind out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the\n\nobligation as  soon as he could.\n \nWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to\n\nbe perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son.\n\nThe son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively\n\nentered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\n\nBennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for\n\n\n\neconomy, and her husband's love of independence had alone\n\nprevented their exceeding their income.\n \nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on\n\nMrs. Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least,\n\nwhich was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no\n\nhesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of  grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,  though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper\n\nhis perfect approbation of all that was done, and his\n\nwillingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for  him. He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be  prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so\n\nlittle inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement.\n\nHe would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money\n\nwhich passed to her through her mother's hands, Lydia's\n\nexpenses had been very little within that sum.\n\nThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at\n\npresent was to have as little trouble in the business as\n\npossible. When the first transports of rage which had\n\n\n\nproduced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally\n\nreturned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon\n\ndispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he\n\nwas quick in its execution. He begged to know further  particulars of what he was indebted to his brother, but was too  angry with Lydia to send any message to her.\n\nThe good news spread quickly through the house, and with\n\nproportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne  in the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have  been more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia\n\nBennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative,\n\nbeen secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But\n\nthere was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the goodnatured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before\n\nfrom all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of\n\ntheir spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such\n\nan husband her misery was considered certain.\n\nIt was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs;\n\nbut on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of\n\nher table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of  shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage of a  daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since\n\nJane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment,\n\nand her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those  attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages,  and servants. She was busily searching through the\n\n\n\nneighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and,  without knowing or considering what their income might be,\n\nrejected many as deficient in size and importance.\n\n\"Haye Park might do,\" said she, \"if the Gouldings could  quit it--or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were  larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have\n\nher ten miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are\n\ndreadful.\"\n \nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained. But when they had withdrawn,\n\nhe said to her: \"Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of\n\nthese houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right  understanding. Into ONE house in this neighbourhood they  shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the\n\nimpudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.\"\n\nA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet\n\nwas firm. It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with\n\namazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a\n\nguinea to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she\n\nshould receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the\n\noccasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his  anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\n\nresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which\n\nher marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she  could believe possible. She was more alive to the disgrace\n\n\n\nwhich her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's  nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living\n\nwith Wickham a fortnight before they took place.\n\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her\n\nmarriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the\n\nelopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable  beginning from all those who were not immediately on the\n\nspot.\n\nShe had no fear of its spreading farther through his means.\n\nThere were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have\n\nmortified her so much--not, however, from any fear of\n\ndisadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,  there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's  marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was\n\nnot to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with\n\na family where, to every other objection, would now be added  an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man  whom he so justly scorned.\n\nFrom such a connection she could not wonder that he\n\nwould shrink. The wish of procuring her regard, which she  had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in\n\n\n\nrational expectation survive such a blow as this. She was  humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly\n\nknew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she\n\ncould no longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear  of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining  intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been\n\nhappy with him, when it was no longer likely they should\n\nmeet.\n \nWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only\n\nfour months ago, would now have been most gladly and\n\ngratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as  the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there  must be a triumph.\n\nShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man\n\nwho, in disposition and talents, would most suit her. His  understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have\n\nanswered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been\n\nto the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind\n\nmight have been softened, his manners improved; and from  his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she  must have received benefit of greater importance.\n\nBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring\n\nmultitude what connubial felicity really was. An union of a\n\n\n\ndifferent tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other,\n\nwas soon to be formed in their family.\n\nHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable\n\nindependence, she could not imagine. But how little of  permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only  brought together because their passions were stronger than\n\ntheir virtue, she could easily conjecture.\n\n* * * * *\n \nMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr.\n\nBennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance\n\nof his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family;\n\nand concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be  mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter\n\nwas to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on\n\nquitting the militia.\n\n\"It was greatly my wish that he should do so,\" he added,  \"as soon as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will  agree with me, in considering the removal from that corps as\n\nhighly advisable, both on his account and my niece's. It is Mr.\n\nWickham's intention to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in\n\nGeneral ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an\n\nadvantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He  promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where\n\n\n\nthey may each have a character to preserve, they will both be  more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him\n\nof our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy\n\nthe various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton,  with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged  myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying\n\nsimilar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall\n\nsubjoin a list according to his information? He has given in all  his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston  has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They\n\nwill then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to\n\nLongbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the  South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to\n\nyou and your mother.--Yours, etc.,\n\n\"E. GARDINER.\"\n \nMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of\n\nWickham's removal from the ----shire as clearly as Mr.\n\nGardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased\n\nwith it. Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had  expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had  by no means given up her plan of their residing in\n\nHertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it\n\nwas such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment  where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many\n\nfavourites.\n\n\n\n\"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,\" said she, \"it will be quite\n\nshocking to send her away! And there are several of the young\n\nmen, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so\n\npleasant in General----'s regiment.\"\n\nHis daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the\n\nNorth, received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and\n\nElizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so\n\nrationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at\n\nLongbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.  And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she\n\nwould be able to show her married daughter in the\n\nneighbourhood before she was banished to the North. When  Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his  permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon\n\nas the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.\n\nElizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last\n\nobject of her wishes.\n\n\n\nChapter 51.\n\nTheir sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return\n\nin it by dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder\n\nMiss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister\n\nmust endure.\n \nThey came. The family were assembled in the breakfast\n\nroom to receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet\n\nas the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked\n\nimpenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.\n\nLydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave\n\nher hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who\n\nfollowed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity\n\nwhich shewed no doubt of their happiness.\n\nTheir reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then\n\nturned, was not quite so cordial. His countenance rather\n\ngained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy  assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to  provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet\n\nwas shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed,\n\n\n\nwild, noisy, and fearless. She turned from sister to sister,  demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all\n\nsat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some\n\nlittle alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a\n\ngreat while since she had been there.\n\nWickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but\n\nhis manners were always so pleasing, that had his character\n\nand his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and  his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would  have delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed\n\nhim quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving\n\nwithin herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of  an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\n\ncheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no\n\nvariation of colour.\n \nThere was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother\n\ncould neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who  happened to sit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his\n\nacquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured\n\nease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies. They  seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the  world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and\n\nLydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not\n\nhave alluded to for the world.\n\n\n\n\"Only think of its being three months,\" she cried, \"since I\n\nwent away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there\n\nhave been things enough happened in the time. Good\n\ngracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of  being married till I came back again! though I thought it\n\nwould be very good fun if I was.\"\n\nHer father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth\n\nlooked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor  saw anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily  continued, \"Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am\n\nmarried to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook\n\nWilliam Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the\n\nwindow frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed\n\nand smiled like anything.\"\n\nElizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing\n\nthrough the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them\n\nsoon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her  mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, \"Ah!  Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I\n\nam a married woman.\"\n \nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at\n\n\n\nfirst. Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see  Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and\n\nto hear herself called \"Mrs. Wickham\" by each of them; and\n\nin the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and\n\nboast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\n\n\"Well, mamma,\" said she, when they were all returned to\n\nthe breakfast room, \"and what do you think of my husband? Is\n\nnot he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy  me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must  all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a\n\npity it is, mamma, we did not all go.\"\n\n\"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear\n\nLydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off. Must it be\n\nso?\"\n \n\"Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all\n\nthings. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and  see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say  there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good\n\npartners for them all.\"\n\n\"I should like it beyond anything!\" said her mother.\n\n\"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two\n\nof my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands\n\nfor them before the winter is over.\"\n\n\n\n\"I thank you for my share of the favour,\" said Elizabeth;\n\n\"but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.\"\n\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with\n\nthem. Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he\n\nleft London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a\n\nfortnight.\n\nNo one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be\n\nso short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about  with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.  These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle\n\nwas even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did\n\nnot.\n \nWickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had\n\nscarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from\n\nthe reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on  by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would  have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he\n\nchose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his\n\nflight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances;  and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist  an opportunity of having a companion.\n\nLydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear\n\nWickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every thing best in the world;\n\n\n\nand she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of\n\nSeptember, than any body else in the country.\n\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting\n\nwith her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:\n \n\"Lizzy, I never gave YOU an account of my wedding, I\n\nbelieve. You were not by, when I told mamma and the others\n\nall about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?\"\n\n\"No really,\" replied Elizabeth; \"I think there cannot be too\n\nlittle said on the subject.\"\n\n\"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went\n\noff. We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because\n\nWickham's lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us\n\nat the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such\n\na fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would  happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite  distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing,\n\npreaching and talking away just as if she was reading a\n\nsermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I\n\nwas thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I  longed to know whether he would be married in his blue\n\ncoat.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it\n\nwould never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand,\n\nthat my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I\n\nwas with them. If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot  out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or  scheme, or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but,\n\nhowever, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the\n\ncarriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon  business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know,  when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was\n\nso frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to\n\ngive me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not  be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten\n\nminutes' time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected\n\nafterwards that if he had been prevented going, the wedding\n\nneed not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\"\n\n\"Mr. Darcy!\" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\n\n\"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you\n\nknow. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have\n\nsaid a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will\n\nWickham say? It was to be such a secret!\"\n\n\"If it was to be secret,\" said Jane, \"say not another word on\n\nthe subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\"\n\n\"Oh! certainly,\" said Elizabeth, though burning with\n\ncuriosity; \"we will ask you no questions.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Lydia, \"for if you did, I should certainly\n\ntell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.\"\n\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put\n\nit out of her power, by running away.\n\nBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy\n\nhad been at her sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and\n\nexactly among people, where he had apparently least to do,  and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it,  rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied\n\nwith none. Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct\n\nin the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not  bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote  a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\n\nLydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which\n\nhad been intended.\n \n\"You may readily comprehend,\" she added, \"what my\n\ncuriosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any\n\nof us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family,\n\nshould have been amongst you at such a time. Pray write  instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent  reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think\n\nnecessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with\n\nignorance.\"\n\n\n\n\"Not that I SHALL, though,\" she added to herself, as she\n\nfinished the letter; \"and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in\n\nan honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks\n\nand stratagems to find it out.\"\n\nJane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to\n\nspeak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall;\n\nElizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries\n\nwould receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a\n\nconfidante.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 52.\n\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she\n\nwas least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the\n\nbenches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter\n\nconvinced her that it did not contain a denial.\n \n\"Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.\n\n\"MY DEAR NIECE,\n\n\"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this  whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a LITTLE  writing will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must\n\nconfess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect\n\nit from YOU. Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean  to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be  necessary on YOUR side. If you do not choose to understand\n\nme, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised\n\nas I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party\n\nconcerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. But\n\nif you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more\n\nexplicit.\n\n\"On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn,  your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called,  and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before\n\n\n\nI arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as\n\nYOUR'S seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner\n\nthat he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham\n\nwere, and that he had seen and talked with them both;\n\nWickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to\n\ntown with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive\n\nprofessed was his conviction of its being owing to himself\n\nthat Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as\n\nto make it impossible for any young woman of character to\n\nlove or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to\n\nhis mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it  beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. His  character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his\n\nduty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which\n\nhad been brought on by himself. If he HAD ANOTHER  motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been  some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but\n\nhe had something to direct his search, which was more than\n\nWE had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for\n\nhis resolving to follow us.\n\n\"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some\n\ntime ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from\n\nher charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did  not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street,  and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This\n\nMrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with\n\n\n\nWickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could\n\nget from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I\n\nsuppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did\n\nknow where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had\n\ngone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been\n\nable to receive them into her house, they would have taken up\n\ntheir abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend  procured the wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He  saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His\n\nfirst object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade\n\nher to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her  friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,  offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found\n\nLydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She\n\ncared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she  would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should  be married some time or other, and it did not much signify\n\nwhen. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he\n\nthought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very  first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never  been HIS design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the\n\nregiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were\n\nvery pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences  of Lydia's flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign  his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he\n\ncould conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere,\n\n\n\nbut he did not know where, and he knew he should have\n\nnothing to live on.\n\n\"Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister\n\nat once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,  he would have been able to do something for him, and his  situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found,\n\nin reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the\n\nhope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in  some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he  was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate\n\nrelief.\n \n\"They met several times, for there was much to be  discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get;  but at length was reduced to be reasonable.\n\n\"Every thing being settled between THEM, Mr. Darcy's\n\nnext step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he  first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came  home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy\n\nfound, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him,\n\nbut would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your  father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as  your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till\n\nafter the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,\n\nand till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had\n\ncalled on business.\n\n\n\n\"On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your\n\nuncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of\n\ntalk together.\n\n\"They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It  was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the  express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very\n\nobstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of\n\nhis character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at  different times, but THIS is the true one. Nothing was to be  done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do\n\nnot speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it),\n\nyour uncle would most readily have settled the whole.\n\n\"They battled it together for a long time, which was more\n\nthan either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.\n\nBut at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being\n\nallowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with  only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely  against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning\n\ngave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation\n\nthat would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the  praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther  than yourself, or Jane at most.\n\n\"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for\n\nthe young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I  believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\n\n\n\nthousand in addition to her own settled upon HER, and his  commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be\n\ndone by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was\n\nowing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration,\n\nthat Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and\n\nconsequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.\n\nPerhaps there was some truth in THIS; though I doubt\n\nwhether HIS reserve, or ANYBODY'S reserve, can be\n\nanswerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,  my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle\n\nwould never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for\n\nANOTHER INTEREST in the affair.\n \n\"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his\n\nfriends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed\n\nthat he should be in London once more when the wedding\n\ntook place, and all money matters were then to receive the last\n\nfinish.\n \n\"I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation\n\nwhich you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least\n\nit will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and\n\nWickham had constant admission to the house. HE was\n\nexactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire;\n\nbut I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her\n\nbehaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by  Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming  home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now\n\n\n\ntell you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly  in the most serious manner, representing to her all the\n\nwickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she\n\nhad brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good  luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite  provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,\n\nand for their sakes had patience with her.\n\n\"Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia  informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the  next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or\n\nThursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I\n\ntake this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough  to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,  in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in\n\nDerbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me; he\n\nwants nothing but a little more liveliness, and THAT, if he  marry PRUDENTLY, his wife may teach him. I thought him  very sly;-he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness\n\nseems the fashion.\n \n\"Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least  do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never  be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low\n\nphaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very\n\nthing.\n\n\n\n\"But I must write no more. The children have been\n\nwanting me this half hour.\n\n\"Yours, very sincerely,\n\n\"M. GARDINER.\"\n \nThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of\n\nspirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure\n\nor pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled\n\nsuspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy  might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which  she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too\n\ngreat to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just,\n\nfrom the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest  extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he\n\nhad taken on himself all the trouble and mortification\n\nattendant on such a research; in which supplication had been\n\nnecessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise,  and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason  with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always\n\nmost wished to avoid, and whose very name it was\n\npunishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a  girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did  whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly\n\nchecked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even\n\nher vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his  affection for her -for a woman who had already refused him--\n\n\n\nas able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence\n\nagainst relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of\n\nWickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the\n\nconnection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed\n\nto think how much. But he had given a reason for his  interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It\n\nwas reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had\n\nliberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though  she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she  could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might\n\nassist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must\n\nbe materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful,  to know that they were under obligations to a person who  could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of\n\nLydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did\n\nshe grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever  encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards  him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.\n\nProud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been\n\nable to get the better of himself. She read over her aunt's  commendation of him again and again. It was hardly enough;  but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some pleasure,\n\nthough mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she\n\nand her uncle had been persuaded that affection and\n\nconfidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.\n\n\n\nShe was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path,\n\nshe was overtaken by Wickham.\n\n\"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear\n\nsister?\" said he, as he joined her.\n\n\"You certainly do,\" she replied with a smile; \"but it does\n\nnot follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.\"\n\n\"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good\n\nfriends; and now we are better.\"\n \n\"True. Are the others coming out?\"\n\n\"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the\n\ncarriage to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our\n\nuncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.\"\n\nShe replied in the affirmative.\n\n\"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would\n\nbe too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to  Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?  Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But of\n\ncourse she did not mention my name to you.\"\n\n\"Yes, she did.\"\n\n\n\n\"And what did she say?\"\n\n\"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had\n\n--not turned out well. At such a distance as THAT, you know,\n\nthings are strangely misrepresented.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she\n\nhad silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:\n \n\"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We\n\npassed each other several times. I wonder what he can be\n\ndoing there.\"\n\n\"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\"\n\nsaid Elizabeth. \"It must be something particular, to take him\n\nthere at this time of year.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at\n\nLambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you\n\nhad.\"\n \n\"Yes; he introduced us to his sister.\"\n \n\"And do you like her?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved\n\nwithin this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very\n\n\n\npromising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn\n\nout well.\"\n \n\"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\"\n\n\"Did you go by the village of Kympton?\"\n\n\"I do not recollect that we did.\"\n \n\"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have\n\nhad. A most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It\n\nwould have suited me in every respect.\"\n\n\"How should you have liked making sermons?\"\n\n\"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of\n\nmy duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One\n\nought not to repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a  thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would  have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be.\n\nDid you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you\n\nwere in Kent?\"\n \n\"I have heard from authority, which I thought AS GOOD,\n\nthat it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the\n\npresent patron.\"\n\n\"You have. Yes, there was something in THAT; I told you\n\nso from the first, you may remember.\"\n\n\n\n\"I DID hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-\n\nmaking was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at\n\npresent; that you actually declared your resolution of never\n\ntaking orders, and that the business had been compromised\n\naccordingly.\"\n\n\"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You\n\nmay remember what I told you on that point, when first we\n\ntalked of it.\"\n \nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's\n\nsake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-\n\nhumoured smile:\n \n\"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you\n\nknow. Do not let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope\n\nwe shall be always of one mind.\"\n\nShe held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate\n\ngallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they\n\nentered the house.\n\n\n\nChapter 53.\n\nMr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject\n\nof it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to\n\nkeep him quiet.\n\nThe day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs.\n\nBennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her\n\nhusband by no means entered into her scheme of their all\n\ngoing to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a\n\ntwelvemonth.\n \n\"Oh! my dear Lydia,\" she cried, \"when shall we meet\n\nagain?\"\n\n\"Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years,\n\nperhaps.\"\n\n\"Write to me very often, my dear.\"\n\n\"As often as I can. But you know married women have\n\nnever much time for writing. My sisters may write to ME.\n\nThey will have nothing else to do.\"\n\nMr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than\n\nhis wife's. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty\n\nthings.\n\n\n\n\"He is as fine a fellow,\" said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they\n\nwere out of the house, \"as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks,\n\nand makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I\n\ndefy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more\n\nvaluable son-in-law.\"\n \nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for\n\nseveral days.\n\n\"I often think,\" said she, \"that there is nothing so bad as\n\nparting with one's friends. One seems so forlorn without\n\nthem.\"\n \n\"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a\n\ndaughter,\" said Elizabeth. \"It must make you better satisfied\n\nthat your other four are single.\"\n\n\"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she\n\nis married, but only because her husband's regiment happens\n\nto be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have\n\ngone so soon.\"\n\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into\n\nwas shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the\n\nagitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to  be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received  orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was\n\ncoming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several\n\n\n\nweeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at\n\nJane, and smiled and shook her head by turns.\n\n\"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\"\n\n(for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). \"Well, so much  the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us,  you know, and I am sure _I_ never want to see him again.\n\nBut, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if\n\nhe likes it. And who knows what MAY happen? But that is  nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to  mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is\n\ncoming?\"\n\n\"You may depend on it,\" replied the other, \"for Mrs.  Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and  went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she\n\ntold me that it was certain true. He comes down on Thursday\n\nat the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was going to the  butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on  Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to\n\nbe killed.\"\n \nMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they\n\nwere alone together, she said:\n\n\"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us\n\nof the present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But\n\n\n\ndon't imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused\n\nfor the moment, because I felt that I SHOULD be looked at. I\n\ndo assure you that the news does not affect me either with\n\npleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone;\n\nbecause we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of\n\nMYSELF, but I dread other people's remarks.\"\n\nElizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not\n\nseen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable  of coming there with no other view than what was  acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and\n\nshe wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there\n\nWITH his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come\n\nwithout it.\n \n\"Yet it is hard,\" she sometimes thought, \"that this poor\n\nman cannot come to a house which he has legally hired,\n\nwithout raising all this speculation! I WILL leave him to\n\nhimself.\"\n \nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to\n\nbe her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth\n\ncould easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They  were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen\n\nthem.\n \nThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between\n\ntheir parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought\n\nforward again.\n\n\n\n\"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\" said Mrs.\n\nBennet, \"you will wait on him of course.\"\n\n\"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and\n\npromised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my  daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a  fool's errand again.\"\n\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such\n\nan attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on\n\nhis returning to Netherfield.\n\n\"'This an etiquette I despise,\" said he. \"If he wants our\n\nsociety, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not\n\nspend my hours in running after my neighbours every time\n\nthey go away and come back again.\"\n\n\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you\n\ndo not wait on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my\n\nasking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs.  Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with  ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him.\"\n\nConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear\n\nher husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to  know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in  consequence of it, before THEY did. As the day of his arrival\n\ndrew near:\n\n\n\n\"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\" said Jane to her\n\nsister. \"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect\n\nindifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually\n\ntalked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no  one can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy  shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\"\n\n\"I wish I could say anything to comfort you,\" replied\n\nElizabeth; \"but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.\"\n\nMr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance\n\nof servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the  period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long  as it could. She counted the days that must intervene before\n\ntheir invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before.\n\nBut on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock\n\nand ride towards the house.\n \nHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.\n\nJane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window--she looked,--she saw  Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.\n\n\"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,\" said Kitty;\n\n\"who can it be?\"\n\n\n\n\"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am\n\nsure I do not know.\"\n \n\"La!\" replied Kitty, \"it looks just like that man that used to\n\nbe with him before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud\n\nman.\"\n \n\"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well,\n\nany friend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to\n\nbe sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\"\n\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore\n\nfelt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in\n\nseeing him almost for the first time after receiving his  explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.\n\nEach felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\n\nmother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her\n\nresolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend,  without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had  sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane,\n\nto whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.\n\nGardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had\n\nundervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he\n\nwas the person to whom the whole family were indebted for  the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\n\n\n\ninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just  as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming-\n\n-at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily\n\nseeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known\n\non first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.\n\nThe colour which had been driven from her face, returned\n\nfor half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of\n\ndelight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space\n\nof time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.\n\nBut she would not be secure.\n \n\"Let me first see how he behaves,\" said she; \"it will then\n\nbe early enough for expectation.\"\n\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried\n\nthem to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching\n\nthe door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate  than Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen's appearing,  her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable\n\nease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\n\nsymptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\n\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not\n\noften command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.\n\nHe looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had\n\nbeen used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him\n\n\n\nat Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's  presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a\n\npainful, but not an improbable, conjecture.\n\nBingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.  He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility\n\nwhich made her two daughters ashamed, especially when\n\ncontrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her\n\ncurtsey and address to his friend.\n\nElizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to\n\nthe latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from\n\nirremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful\n\ndegree by a distinction so ill applied.\n\nDarcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\n\ndid, a question which she could not answer without confusion,\n\nsaid scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that\n\nwas the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in\n\nDerbyshire. There he had talked to her friends, when he could\n\nnot to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without\n\nbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally,  unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised he eyes to  his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself,\n\nand frequently on no object but the ground. More\n\nthoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last\n\n\n\nmet, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry\n\nwith herself for being so.\n\n\"Could I expect it to be otherwise!\" said she. \"Yet why did\n\nhe come?\"\n \nShe was in no humour for conversation with anyone but\n\nhimself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.\n\nShe inquired after his sister, but could do no more.\n\n\"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\" said\n\nMrs. Bennet.\n \nHe readily agreed to it.\n\n\"I began to be afraid you would never come back again.\n\nPeople DID say you meant to quit the place entirely at  Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went\n\naway. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own\n\ndaughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must  have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The  Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It\n\nwas only said, 'Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia\n\nBennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was my brother  Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to\n\nmake such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\"\n\n\n\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.\n\nElizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked,\n\ntherefore, she could not tell.\n\n\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well\n\nmarried,\" continued her mother, \"but at the same time, Mr.\n\nBingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.\n\nThey are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it\n\nseems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His  regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving  the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank\n\nHeaven! he has SOME friends, though perhaps not so many\n\nas he deserves.\"\n \nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.\n\nIt drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which\n\nnothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked  Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at  present. A few weeks, he believed.\n\n\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\"\n\nsaid her mother, \"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many  as you please on Mr. Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be  vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the\n\ncovies for you.\"\n\nElizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at\n\n\n\npresent as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was  persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious\n\nconclusion. At that instant, she felt that years of happiness\n\ncould not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such\n\npainful confusion.\n\n\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never\n\nmore to be in company with either of them. Their society can\n\nafford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as\n\nthis! Let me never see either one or the other again!\"\n\nYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer\n\nno compensation, received soon afterwards material relief,\n\nfrom observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled\n\nthe admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he\n\nhad spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to\n\nbe giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome\n\nas she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected,  though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no  difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really\n\npersuaded that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was\n\nso busily engaged, that she did not always know when she\n\nwas silent.\n \nWhen the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was\n\nmindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and\n\nengaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.\n\n\n\n\"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\" she added,\n\n\"for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take\n\na family dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not\n\nforgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much  disappointed that you did not come back and keep your  engagement.\"\n\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said\n\nsomething of his concern at having been prevented by\n\nbusiness. They then went away.\n\nMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay\n\nand dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very\n\ngood table, she did not think anything less than two courses  could be good enough for a man on whom she had such  anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who\n\nhad ten thousand a year.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 54.\n\nAs soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more.\n\nMr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.\n\n\"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\"\n\nsaid she, \"did he come at all?\"\n \nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\n\n\"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and\n\naunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears  me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why  silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will think no more about\n\nhim.\"\n \nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful\n\nlook, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors,\n\nthan Elizabeth.\n \n\"Now,\" said she, \"that this first meeting is over, I feel  perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be  embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on\n\nTuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we\n\nmeet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, very indifferent indeed,\" said Elizabeth, laughingly.\n\n\"Oh, Jane, take care.\"\n \n\"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in\n\ndanger now?\"\n\n\"I think you are in very great danger of making him as\n\nmuch in love with you as ever.\"\n\n* * * * *\n \nThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and  Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour and common\n\npoliteness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.\n\nOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at  Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very\n\ngood time. When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth\n\neagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place,  which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her  sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas,\n\nforbore to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room,\n\nhe seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and\n\nhappened to smile: it was decided. He placed himself by her.\n\n\n\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his\n\nfriend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have\n\nimagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy,\n\nhad she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy,\n\nwith an expression of half-laughing alarm.\n\nHis behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as\n\nshowed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded\n\nthan formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to  himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily  secured. Though she dared not depend upon the consequence,\n\nshe yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\n\ngave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she  was in no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from\n\nher as the table could divide them. He was on one side of her\n\nmother. She knew how little such a situation would give\n\npleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage. She  was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she  could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how\n\nformal and cold was their manner whenever they did. Her\n\nmother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed  him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at  times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his\n\nkindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the\n\nfamily.\n\nShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the\n\n\n\nvisit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into  something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious\n\nsalutation attending his entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the\n\nperiod which passed in the drawing-room, before the  gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that\n\nalmost made her uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance\n\nas the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the\n\nevening must depend.\n\n\"If he does not come to me, THEN,\" said she, \"I shall give\n\nhim up for ever.\"\n\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he\n\nwould have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had  crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea,  and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a\n\nconfederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her\n\nwhich would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's  approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever,  and said, in a whisper:\n\n\"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We\n\nwant none of them; do we?\"\n \nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he\n\nspoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to\n\ncoffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!\n\n\n\n\"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be\n\nfoolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one\n\namong the sex, who would not protest against such a\n\nweakness as a second proposal to the same woman? There is\n\nno indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!\"\n\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his\n\ncoffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:\n\n\"Is your sister at Pemberley still?\"\n\n\"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.\"\n \n\"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on\n\nto Scarborough, these three weeks.\"\n\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success. He stood by\n\nher, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the\n\nyoung lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\n\nWhen the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to\n\nbe soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown\n\nby seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist  players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the  party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure. They were\n\n\n\nconfined for the evening at different tables, and she had  nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned\n\ntowards her side of the room, as to make him play as\n\nunsuccessfully as herself.\n\nMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered\n\nbefore any of the others, and she had no opportunity of\n\ndetaining them.\n\n\"Well girls,\" said she, as soon as they were left to\n\nthemselves, \"What say you to the day? I think every thing has\n\npassed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as\n\nwell dressed as any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a  turn-and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch. The  soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases'\n\nlast week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the\n\npartridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has  two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never  saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I\n\nasked her whether you did not. And what do you think she\n\nsaid besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at\n\nNetherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty\n\nbehaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them\n\nprodigiously.\"\n\n\n\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced\n\nthat she would get him at last; and her expectations of\n\nadvantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far  beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing  him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\n\n\"It has been a very agreeable day,\" said Miss Bennet to\n\nElizabeth. \"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we may often meet again.\"\n\nElizabeth smiled.\n \n\"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It\n\nmortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his  conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without  having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what\n\nhis manners now are, that he never had any design of\n\nengaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with  greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of  generally pleasing, than any other man.\"\n\n\"You are very cruel,\" said her sister, \"you will not let me\n\nsmile, and are provoking me to it every moment.\"\n\n\"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!\"\n \n\"And how impossible in others!\"\n\n\n\n\"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more\n\nthan I acknowledge?\"\n\n\"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.\n\nWe all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.\"\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 55.\n\nA few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time. He sat with them above\n\nan hour, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet\n\ninvited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of\n\nconcern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\n\n\"Next time you call,\" said she, \"I hope we shall be more\n\nlucky.\"\n\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.\n\n\"Can you come to-morrow?\"\n\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.\n\nHe came, and in such very good time that the ladies were\n\nnone of them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's\n\nroom, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished,\n\ncrying out:\n\n\"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--\n\nMr. Bingley is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste.\n\n\n\nHere, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair.\"\n\n\"We will be down as soon as we can,\" said Jane; \"but I\n\ndare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up\n\nstairs half an hour ago.\"\n\n\"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be\n\nquick, be quick! Where is your sash, my dear?\"\n\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be\n\nprevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.\n\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible\n\nagain in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the\n\nlibrary, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her  instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed,  Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and\n\nCatherine for a considerable time, without making any\n\nimpression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and  when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, \"What is the  matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What\n\nam I to do?\"\n \n\"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.\" She then  sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a  precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,\n\n\"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,\" took her out of\n\nthe room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke\n\n\n\nher distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that SHE  would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-\n\nopened the door and called out:\n\n\"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\"\n\nElizabeth was forced to go.\n\n\"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;\"\n\nsaid her mother, as soon as she was in the hall. \"Kitty and I\n\nare going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room.\"\n\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of\n\nsight, then returned into the drawing-room.\n\nMrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.  Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His ease and cheerfulness\n\nrendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party;\n\nand he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother,  and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and  command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.\n\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before\n\nhe went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his  own and Mrs. Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to\n\nshoot with her husband.\n\n\n\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but\n\nElizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must\n\nspeedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the  stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded  that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's\n\nconcurrence.\n \nBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr.  Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on.  The latter was much more agreeable than his companion\n\nexpected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in\n\nBingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into\n\nsilence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric,\n\nthan the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned\n\nwith him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's\n\ninvention was again at work to get every body away from him  and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went  into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as\n\nthe others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\n\nwanted to counteract her mother's schemes.\n \nBut on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to\n\nfear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On\n\nopening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley  standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest  conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of\n\n\n\nboth, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each\n\nother, would have told it all. Their situation was awkward\n\nenough; but HER'S she thought was still worse. Not a syllable\n\nwas uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going  away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat  down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her\n\nsister, ran out of the room.\n\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where\n\nconfidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her,  acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the\n\nhappiest creature in the world.\n\n\"'This too much!\" she added, \"by far too much. I do not\n\ndeserve it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?\"\n\nElizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a\n\nwarmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.\n\nEvery sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to  Jane. But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said for the present.\n\n\"I must go instantly to my mother;\" she cried. \"I would not\n\non any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow  her to hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father  already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will\n\ngive such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so\n\nmuch happiness!\"\n\n\n\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely\n\nbroken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\n\nElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the\n\nrapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that  had given them so many previous months of suspense and\n\nvexation.\n \n\"And this,\" said she, \"is the end of all his friend's anxious\n\ncircumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!\n\nthe happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\"\n\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose\n\nconference with her father had been short and to the purpose.\n\n\"Where is your sister?\" said he hastily, as he opened the\n\ndoor.\n \n\"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment,\n\nI dare say.\"\n\nHe then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relation-\n\nship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her\n\nsister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his  own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his  being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of\n\nfelicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis\n\n\n\nthe excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of  Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her\n\nand himself.\n \nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet\n\nanimation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.\n\nKitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming\n\nsoon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her  approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,  though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour;\n\nand when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and\n\nmanner plainly showed how really happy he was.\n\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was\n\ngone, he turned to his daughter, and said:\n\n\"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy\n\nwoman.\"\n \nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him\n\nfor his goodness.\n\n\"You are a good girl;\" he replied, \"and I have great  pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not  a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by\n\nno means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that\n\nnothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant\n\n\n\nwill cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed\n\nyour income.\"\n\n\"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money\n\nmatters would be unpardonable in me.\"\n\n\"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,\" cried his\n\nwife, \"what are you talking of? Why, he has four or five\n\nthousand a year, and very likely more.\" Then addressing her\n\ndaughter, \"Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I  shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I  always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be\n\nso beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw\n\nhim, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought  how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is the  handsomest young man that ever was seen!\"\n\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond\n\ncompetition her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for  no other. Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with  her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able\n\nto dispense.\n\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\n\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at\n\nLongbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always\n\nremaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous\n\n\n\nneighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him  an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to\n\naccept.\n \nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her\n\nsister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to  bestow on anyone else; but she found herself considerably\n\nuseful to both of them in those hours of separation that must\n\nsometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always attached  himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and  when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same\n\nmeans of relief.\n \n\"He has made me so happy,\" said she, one evening, \"by  telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town  last spring! I had not believed it possible.\"\n\n\"I suspected as much,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But how did he\n\naccount for it?\"\n \n\"It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly\n\nno friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot\n\nwonder at, since he might have chosen so much more\n\nadvantageously in many respects. But when they see, as I trust  they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn  to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though\n\nwe can never be what we once were to each other.\"\n\n\n\n\"That is the most unforgiving speech,\" said Elizabeth, \"that\n\nI ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to\n\nsee you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.\"\n\n\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town  last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a  persuasion of MY being indifferent would have prevented his\n\ncoming down again!\"\n\n\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit\n\nof his modesty.\"\n\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his\n\ndiffidence, and the little value he put on his own good\n\nqualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not  betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had  the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew\n\nit was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\n\n\"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever  existed!\" cried Jane. \"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from  my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see\n\nYOU as happy! If there WERE but such another man for\n\nyou!\"\n\n\"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be\n\nso happy as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I\n\nnever can have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for\n\n\n\nmyself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet\n\nwith another Mr. Collins in time.\"\n \nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not\n\nbe long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to  Mrs. Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do  the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.\n\nThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest\n\nfamily in the world, though only a few weeks before, when  Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to\n\nbe marked out for misfortune.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 56.\n\nOne morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement\n\nwith Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the\n\nfamily were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention\n\nwas suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a\n\ncarriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the  lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides,  the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.\n\nThe horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery\n\nof the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them. As it  was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley  instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement\n\nof such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\n\nshrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the  remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till  the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was\n\nLady Catherine de Bourgh.\n\nThey were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of  Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to\n\nthem, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\n\nShe entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a\n\nword. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her\n\n\n\nladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had\n\nbeen made.\n \nMrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a\n\nguest of such high importance, received her with the utmost  politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very  stiffly to Elizabeth, \"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That\n\nlady, I suppose, is your mother.\"\n\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\n\n\"And THAT I suppose is one of your sisters.\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a\n\nLady Catherine. \"She is my youngest girl but one. My\n\nyoungest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere  about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe,  will soon become a part of the family.\"\n\n\"You have a very small park here,\" returned Lady\n\nCatherine after a short silence.\n \n\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare\n\nsay; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William\n\nLucas's.\"\n \n\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the\n\nevening, in summer; the windows are full west.\"\n\n\n\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after\n\ndinner, and then added:\n \n\"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether\n\nyou left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.\"\n\n\"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.\"\n\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for\n\nher from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for\n\nher calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely\n\npuzzled.\n\nMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to\n\ntake some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely,\n\nand not very politely, declined eating anything; and then,\n\nrising up, said to Elizabeth,\n\n\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little\n\nwilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a\n\nturn in it, if you will favour me with your company.\"\n\n\"Go, my dear,\" cried her mother, \"and show her ladyship\n\nabout the different walks. I think she will be pleased with the\n\nhermitage.\"\n\nElizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the\n\n\n\ndining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them,\n\nafter a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.\n\nHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that\n\nher waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along  the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was\n\ndetermined to make no effort for conversation with a woman\n\nwho was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.\n\n\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\" said she, as\n\nshe looked in her face.\n \nAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began\n\nin the following manner:-\n\n\"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the\n\nreason of my journey hither. Your own heart, your own\n\nconscience, must tell you why I come.\"\n\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\n \n\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all\n\nable to account for the honour of seeing you here.\"\n\n\"Miss Bennet,\" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you\n\nought to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however\n\ninsincere YOU may choose to be, you shall not find ME so.  My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and\n\nfrankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall\n\n\n\ncertainly not depart from it. A report of a most alarming  nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your\n\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married,\n\nbut that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all  likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own  nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I KNOW it must be a scandalous\n\nfalsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to\n\nsuppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting  off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to  you.\"\n\n\"If you believed it impossible to be true,\" said Elizabeth,\n\ncolouring with astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took  the trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship  propose by it?\"\n\n\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally\n\ncontradicted.\"\n \n\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\"\n\nsaid Elizabeth coolly, \"will be rather a confirmation of it; if,\n\nindeed, such a report is in existence.\"\n\n\"If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not  been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know  that such a report is spread abroad?\"\n\n\"I never heard that it was.\"\n\n\n\n\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation\n\nfor it?\"\n \n\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your\n\nladyship. You may ask questions which I shall not choose to\n\nanswer.\"\n \n\"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being\n\nsatisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of\n\nmarriage?\"\n\n\"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\"\n\n\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of\n\nhis reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of\n\ninfatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself\n\nand to all his family. You may have drawn him in.\"\n\n\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\"\n\n\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been\n\naccustomed to such language as this. I am almost the nearest\n\nrelation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his\n\ndearest concerns.\"\n \n\"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such\n\nbehaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.\"\n\n\n\n\"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you\n\nhave the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No,\n\nnever. Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have\n\nyou to say?\"\n\n\"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to\n\nsuppose he will make an offer to me.\"\n\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:\n\n\"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From\n\ntheir infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was\n\nthe favourite wish of HIS mother, as well as of her's. While in\n\ntheir cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment\n\nwhen the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in  their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior  birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\n\nthe family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?\n\nTo his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his\n\ncousin?\"\n \n\"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If\n\nthere is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I  shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother\n\nand aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did\n\nas much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion  depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor\n\n\n\ninclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make  another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept\n\nhim?\"\n \n\"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid  it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed  by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the\n\ninclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and\n\ndespised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will  be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any\n\nof us.\"\n \n\"These are heavy misfortunes,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But the\n\nwife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of  happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could,  upon the whole, have no cause to repine.\"\n\n\"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this\n\nyour gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing\n\ndue to me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to\n\nunderstand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the\n\ndetermined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be\n\ndissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any  person's whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking  disappointment.\"\n\n\"THAT will make your ladyship's situation at present more\n\npitiable; but it will have no effect on me.\"\n\n\n\n\"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter\n\nand my nephew are formed for each other. They are\n\ndescended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line;\n\nand, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and  ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on both sides  is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of\n\nevery member of their respective houses; and what is to divide\n\nthem? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without  family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it  must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good,\n\nyou would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been\n\nbrought up.\"\n\n\"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as\n\nquitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's\n\ndaughter; so far we are equal.\"\n\n\"True. You ARE a gentleman's daughter. But who was  your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine  me ignorant of their condition.\"\n\n\"Whatever my connections may be,\" said Elizabeth, \"if\n\nyour nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to\n\nYOU.\"\n \n\"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\"\n\n\n\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question, she\n\ncould not but say, after a moment's deliberation:\n\n\"I am not.\"\n \nLady Catherine seemed pleased.\n\n\"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an\n\nengagement?\"\n\n\"I will make no promise of the kind.\"\n\n\"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to\n\nfind a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive\n\nyour self into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go\n\naway till you have given me the assurance I require.\"\n\n\"And I certainly NEVER shall give it. I am not to be\n\nintimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your\n\nladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would\n\nmy giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at  all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me,  would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to\n\nbestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine,\n\nthat the arguments with which you have supported this  extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the  application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my\n\ncharacter, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions\n\n\n\nas these. How far your nephew might approve of your  interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly\n\nno right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to\n\nbe importuned no farther on the subject.\"\n\n\"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To\n\nall the objections I have already urged, I have still another to\n\nadd. I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest\n\nsister's infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young  man's marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expence  of your father and uncles. And is such a girl to be my\n\nnephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his late father's\n\nsteward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are\n\nyou thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus\n\npolluted?\"\n\n\"You can now have nothing further to say,\" she resentfully\n\nanswered. \"You have insulted me in every possible method. I\n\nmust beg to return to the house.\"\n\nAnd she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and\n\nthey turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.\n\n\"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my  nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a  connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of\n\neverybody?\"\n\n\n\n\"Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know\n\nmy sentiments.\"\n\n\"You are then resolved to have him?\"\n \n\"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that  manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my  happiness, without reference to YOU, or to any person so\n\nwholly unconnected with me.\"\n\n\"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to  obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are  determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and\n\nmake him the contempt of the world.\"\n\n\"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\" replied  Elizabeth, \"have any possible claim on me, in the present  instance. No principle of either would be violated by my\n\nmarriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment\n\nof his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former  WERE excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one\n\nmoment's concern -and the world in general would have too\n\nmuch sense to join in the scorn.\"\n\n\"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve!  Very well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss  Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try\n\nyou. I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I\n\nwill carry my point.\"\n\n\n\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she\n\nadded, \"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no\n\ncompliments to your mother. You deserve no such attention. I\n\nam most seriously displeased.\"\n\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to\n\npersuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly\n\ninto it herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she  proceeded up stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the  door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would\n\nnot come in again and rest herself.\n\n\"She did not choose it,\" said her daughter, \"she would go.\"\n\n\"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here\n\nwas prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us\n\nthe Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare\n\nsay, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as  well call on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to  you, Lizzy?\"\n\nElizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here;\n\nfor to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was\n\nimpossible.\n\n\n\nChapter 57.\n\nThe discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.\n\nLady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of\n\nthis journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking  off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a  rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their\n\nengagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to\n\nimagine; till she recollected that HIS being the intimate friend  of Bingley, and HER being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a  time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody\n\neager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself\n\nforgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring  them more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas  Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the\n\nCollinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady\n\nCatherine), had only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at\n\nsome future time.\n \nIn revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she\n\ncould not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible  consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what  she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it\n\noccurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to\n\nher nephew; and how HE might take a similar representation\n\n\n\nof the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not\n\npronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for\n\nhis aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was\n\nnatural to suppose that he thought much higher of her  ladyship than SHE could do; and it was certain that, in  enumerating the miseries of a marriage with ONE, whose\n\nimmediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt\n\nwould address him on his weakest side. With his notions of\n\ndignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to  Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much\n\ngood sense and solid reasoning.\n\nIf he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at\n\nonce to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him.\n\nIn that case he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to  Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\n\n\"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise\n\nshould come to his friend within a few days,\" she added, \"I  shall know how to understand it. I shall then give over every  expectation, every wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied\n\nwith only regretting me, when he might have obtained my\n\naffections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n\n\nThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied\n\nit, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs.\n\nBennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.\n\nThe next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was\n\nmet by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in\n\nhis hand.\n \n\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"I was going to look for you; come into\n\nmy room.\"\n\nShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what\n\nhe had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its  being in some manner connected with the letter he held. It  suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and\n\nshe anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.\n\nShe followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat\n\ndown. He then said,\n \n\"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished\n\nme exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you\n\nought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I had  two daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate  you on a very important conquest.\"\n\n\n\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the\n\ninstantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,\n\ninstead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most\n\nto be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that\n\nhis letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father\n\ncontinued:\n \n\"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration\n\nin such matters as these; but I think I may defy even YOUR  sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer. This letter is\n\nfrom Mr. Collins.\"\n \n\"From Mr. Collins! and what can HE have to say?\"\n\n\"Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins  with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest  daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the\n\ngood-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your\n\nimpatience, by reading what he says on that point. What  relates to yourself, is as follows: 'Having thus offered you the  sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this\n\nhappy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of\n\nanother; of which we have been advertised by the same  authority. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not  long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has\n\nresigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be\n\nreasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious\n\npersonages in this land.'\n\n\n\n\"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\"\n\n'This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with\n\nevery thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid\n\nproperty, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite  of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and  yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure\n\nwith this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be\n\ninclined to take immediate advantage of.'\n\n\"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But\n\nnow it comes out:\n \n\"'My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have\n\nreason to imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\n\ndoes not look on the match with a friendly eye.'\n\n\"MR. DARCY, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I\n\nHAVE surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched\n\non any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name  would have given the lie more effectually to what they  related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see\n\na blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life! It\n\nis admirable!\"\n \nElizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been\n\ndirected in a manner so little agreeable to her.\n\n\"Are you not diverted?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh! yes. Pray read on.\"\n\n\"'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her\n\nladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual\n\ncondescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when  it become apparent, that on the score of some family  objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her\n\nconsent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it\n\nmy duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my  cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what  they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has\n\nnot been properly sanctioned.' Mr. Collins moreover adds, 'I\n\nam truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has  been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their  living together before the marriage took place should be so\n\ngenerally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of\n\nmy station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at  hearing that you received the young couple into your house as  soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice;\n\nand had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very\n\nstrenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive  them, as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or  allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.' That is his\n\nnotion of Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only\n\nabout his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a  young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not  enjoy it. You are not going to be MISSISH, I hope, and\n\npretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live,\n\n\n\nbut to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our\n\nturn?\"\n \n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I am excessively diverted. But it is\n\nso strange!\"\n\n\"Yes--THAT is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on\n\nany other man it would have been nothing; but HIS perfect\n\nindifference, and YOUR pointed dislike, make it so\n\ndelightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not  give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any consideration.  Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the\n\npreference even over Wickham, much as I value the\n\nimpudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy,  what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to\n\nrefuse her consent?\"\n \nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh;\n\nand as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was  not distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been  more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.\n\nIt was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.\n\nHer father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of  Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps,\n\ninstead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too\n\nmuch.\n\n\n\nChapter 58.\n\nInstead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days\n\nhad passed after Lady Catherine's visit. The gentlemen arrived\n\nearly; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their  having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary  dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed\n\ntheir all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in\n\nthe habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the  remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane, however,  soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind,\n\nwhile Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other.\n\nVery little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.\n\nThey walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to\n\ncall upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making  it a general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on\n\nwith him alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be\n\nexecuted, and, while her courage was high, she immediately\n\nsaid:\n \n\"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake\n\nof giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may\n\nbe wounding your's. I can no longer help thanking you for\n\nyour unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I\n\n\n\nhave known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to  you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my\n\nfamily, I should not have merely my own gratitude to\n\nexpress.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\" replied Darcy, in a tone of\n\nsurprise and emotion, \"that you have ever been informed of\n\nwhat may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I\n\ndid not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.\"\n \n\"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness\n\nfirst betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the\n\nmatter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the\n\nparticulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of  all my family, for that generous compassion which induced  you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications,\n\nfor the sake of discovering them.\"\n\n\"If you WILL thank me,\" he replied, \"let it be for yourself\n\nalone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add\n\nforce to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not\n\nattempt to deny. But your FAMILY owe me nothing. Much as\n\nI respect them, I believe I thought only of YOU.\"\n\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause, her companion added, \"You are too generous to\n\ntrifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last\n\nApril, tell me so at once. MY affections and wishes are\n\n\n\nunchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this\n\nsubject for ever.\"\n\nElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness\n\nand anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and  immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to  understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a\n\nchange, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her\n\nreceive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances.  The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had  probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the\n\noccasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love\n\ncan be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to encounter  his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of  heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but,\n\nthough she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of\n\nfeelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to\n\nhim, made his affection every moment more valuable.\n\nThey walked on, without knowing in what direction. There\n\nwas too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to\n\nany other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for  their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt,  who did call on him in her return through London, and there\n\nrelate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance\n\nof her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on  every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's  apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and\n\n\n\nassurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist her\n\nendeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she\n\nhad refused to give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect\n\nhad been exactly contrariwise.\n\n\"It taught me to hope,\" said he, \"as I had scarcely ever al\n\nlowed myself to hope before. I knew enough of your\n\ndisposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely,\n\nirrevocably   decided   against   me,   you   would   have\n\nacknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.\"\n\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \"Yes, you\n\nknow enough of my frankness to believe me capable of\n\nTHAT. After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations.\"\n\n\"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For,\n\nthough your accusations were ill-founded, formed on\n\nmistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had  merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I cannot\n\nthink of it without abhorrence.\"\n \n\"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame\n\nannexed to that evening,\" said Elizabeth. \"The conduct of  neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since  then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility.\"\n\n\"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The\n\nrecollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners,\n\n\n\nmy expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been  many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so\n\nwell applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more\n\ngentlemanlike manner.' Those were your words. You know  not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;-though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable\n\nenough to allow their justice.\"\n\n\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so  strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being  ever felt in such a way.\"\n\n\"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of\n\nevery proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your  countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not  have addressed you in any possible way that would induce\n\nyou to accept me.\"\n\n\"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections  will not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most  heartily ashamed of it.\"\n\nDarcy mentioned his letter. \"Did it,\" said he, \"did it soon\n\nmake you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any\n\ncredit to its contents?\"\n \nShe explained what its effect on her had been, and how\n\ngradually all her former prejudices had been removed.\n\n\n\n\"I knew,\" said he, \"that what I wrote must give you pain,\n\nbut it was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter.\n\nThere was one part especially, the opening of it, which I\n\nshould dread your having the power of reading again. I can  remember some expressions which might justly make you\n\nhate me.\"\n \n\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it\n\nessential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we  have both reason to think my opinions not entirely  unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as\n\nthat implies.\"\n\n\"When I wrote that letter,\" replied Darcy, \"I believed my self perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it  was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.\"\n\n\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end\n\nso. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter.  The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who  received it, are now so widely different from what they were\n\nthen, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to\n\nbe forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Think\n\nonly of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.\"\n\n\"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.\n\nYour retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that\n\nthe contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but,\n\nwhat is much better, of innocence. But with me, it is not so.\n\n\n\nPainful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in\n\npractice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what\n\nwas right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was  given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and  conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only\n\nchild), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good\n\nthemselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent  and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be  selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own\n\nfamily circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to\n\nwish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth  compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and  twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest,\n\nloveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a\n\nlesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I  was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my  reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my\n\npretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.\"\n\n\"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?\"\n\n\"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I\n\nbelieved you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.\"\n\n\"My manners must have been in fault, but not\n\nintentionally, I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but\n\n\n\nmy spirits might often lead me wrong. How you must have\n\nhated me after THAT evening?\"\n\n\"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon\n\nbegan to take a proper direction.\"\n\n\"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me,\n\nwhen we met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?\"\n\n\"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\"\n\n\"Your surprise could not be greater than MINE in being  noticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no  extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to\n\nreceive MORE than my due.\"\n\n\"My object then,\" replied Darcy, \"was to show you, by  every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent  the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen\n\nyour ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had\n\nbeen at tended to. How soon any other wishes introduced  themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an  hour after I had seen you.\"\n\nHe then told her of Georgiana's delight in her\n\nacquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden  interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that  interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following\n\nher from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed\n\n\n\nbefore he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and  thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than\n\nwhat such a purpose must comprehend.\n\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a\n\nsubject to each, to be dwelt on farther.\n\nAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too\n\nbusy to know anything about it, they found at last, on\n\nexamining their watches, that it was time to be at home.\n\n\"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\" was a\n\nwonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy\n\nwas delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him\n\nthe earliest information of it.\n \n\"I must ask whether you were surprised?\" said Elizabeth.\n\n\"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon\n\nhappen.\"\n\n\"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed  as much.\" And though he exclaimed at the term, she found  that it had been pretty much the case.\n\n\"On the evening before my going to London,\" said he, \"I\n\nmade a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have  made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred to make my  former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent. His\n\n\n\nsurprise was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I  told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in\n\nsupposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to\n\nhim; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her\n\nwas unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\"\n\nElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of\n\ndirecting his friend.\n\n\"Did you speak from your own observation,\" said she,  \"when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from  my information last spring?\"\n\n\"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the\n\ntwo visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced\n\nof her affection.\"\n \n\"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate\n\nconviction to him.\"\n \n\"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His  diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment  in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made every\n\nthing easy. I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a\n\ntime, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow myself  to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last  winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.\n\nHe was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer\n\n\n\nthan he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He\n\nhas heartily forgiven me now.\"\n\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a\n\nmost delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was\n\ninvaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he\n\nhad yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to\n\nbegin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of\n\ncourse was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the  conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they  parted.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 59.\n\n\"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\"  was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as  she entered their room, and from all the others when they sat\n\ndown to table. She had only to say in reply, that they had\n\nwandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She  coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else,  awakened a suspicion of the truth.\n\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything\n\nextraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed,  the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a  disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and\n\nElizabeth, agitated and confused, rather KNEW that she was\n\nhappy than FELT herself to be so; for, besides the immediate\n\nembarrassment, there were other evils before her. She\n\nanticipated what would be felt in the family when her\n\nsituation became known; she was aware that no one liked him\n\nbut Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike\n\nwhich not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\n\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion\n\nwas very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was\n\nabsolutely incredulous here.\n\n\"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr.\n\nDarcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be\n\nimpossible.\"\n\n\n\n\"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence\n\nwas on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you\n\ndo not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the\n\ntruth. He still loves me, and we are engaged.\"\n\nJane looked at her doubtingly. \"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I\n\nknow how much you dislike him.\"\n\n\"You know nothing of the matter. THAT is all to be\n\nforgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.  But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.  This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself.\"\n\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again,\n\nand more seriously assured her of its truth.\n\n\"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe\n\nyou,\" cried Jane. \"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do\n\ncongratulate you--but are you certain? forgive the question --\n\nare you quite certain that you can be happy with him?\"\n\n\"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us\n\nalready, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But\n\nare you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?\"\n\n\"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or  myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as  impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough?\n\n\n\nOh, Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection.\n\nAre you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel MORE than I ought to\n\ndo, when I tell you all.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do\n\nBingley. I am afraid you will be angry.\"\n\n\"My dearest sister, now BE serious. I want to talk very  seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without  delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?\"\n\n\"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know\n\nwhen it began. But I believe I must date it from my first\n\nseeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.\"\n\nAnother entreaty that she would be serious, however,\n\nproduced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her\n\nsolemn assurances of attachment. When convinced on that\n\narticle, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish.\n\n\"Now I am quite happy,\" said she, \"for you will be as\n\nhappy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for\n\nnothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed  him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can  be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you\n\n\n\nhave been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you  tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all\n\nthat I know of it to another, not to you.\"\n\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his\n\nfriend. But now she would no longer conceal from her his\n\nshare in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the\n\nnight spent in conversation.\n\n* * * * *\n \n\"Good gracious!\" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a\n\nwindow the next morning, \"if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is  not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he  mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had\n\nno notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other,\n\nand not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with  him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may  not be in Bingley's way.\"\n\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a\n\nproposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be\n\nalways giving him such an epithet.\n\nAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so\n\nexpressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no\n\ndoubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said\n\n\n\naloud, \"Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in\n\nwhich Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?\"\n\n\"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\" said Mrs.\n\nBennet, \"to walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.\"\n\n\"It may do very well for the others,\" replied Mr. Bingley;\n\n\"but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?\"\n\nKitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and  Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs to get\n\nready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:\n\n\"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have  that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not  mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no\n\noccasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do\n\nnot put yourself to inconvenience.\"\n\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening.\n\nElizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's.\n\nShe could not determine how her mother would take it;\n\nsometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur  would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But\n\nwhether she were violently set against the match, or violently\n\ndelighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be  equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no\n\n\n\nmore bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her\n\njoy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.\n\n* * * * *\n \nIn the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her\n\nfather's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and\n\nthat it should be through her means--that SHE, his favourite  child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be  filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a\n\nwretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy\n\nappeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved  by his smile. In a few minutes he approached the table where  she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her\n\nwork said in a whisper, \"Go to your father, he wants you in\n\nthe library.\" She was gone directly.\n\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. \"Lizzy,\" said he, \"what are you doing? Are you out\n\nof your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always\n\nhated him?\"\n \nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It\n\nwould have spared her from explanations and professions\n\nwhich it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now\n\n\n\nnecessary, and she assured him, with some confusion, of her\n\nattachment to Mr. Darcy.\n\n\"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is\n\nrich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine\n\ncarriages than Jane. But will they make you happy?\"\n\n\"Have you any other objection,\" said Elizabeth, \"than your\n\nbelief of my indifference?\"\n\n\"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant\n\nsort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked\n\nhim.\"\n \n\"I do, I do like him,\" she replied, with tears in her eyes, \"I\n\nlove him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly  amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not  pain me by speaking of him in such terms.\"\n\n\"Lizzy,\" said her father, \"I have given him my consent. He\n\nis the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse\n\nanything, which he condescended to ask. I now give it to  YOU, if you are resolved on having him. But let me advise\n\nyou to think better of it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I\n\nknow that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless  you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to  him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the\n\ngreatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely\n\nescape discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the\n\n\n\ngrief of seeing YOU unable to respect your partner in life.\n\nYou know not what you are about.\"\n\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in\n\nher reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr.  Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the  gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone,\n\nrelating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the\n\nwork of a day, but had stood the test of many months  suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,  she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to\n\nthe match.\n \n\"Well, my dear,\" said he, when she ceased speaking, \"I  have no more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I  could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less\n\nworthy.\"\n\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her\n\nwith astonishment.\n \n\"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did\n\nevery thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the  fellow's debts, and got him his commission! So much the bet ter. It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it\n\nbeen your uncle's doing, I must and WOULD have paid him;\n\nbut these violent young lovers carry every thing their own  way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and\n\n\n\nstorm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the\n\nmatter.\"\n \nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before,\n\non his reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her  some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the  room, \"If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them\n\nin, for I am quite at leisure.\"\n\nElizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable\n\ncomposure. Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the\n\nevening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything  material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity\n\nwould come in time.\n \nWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night,\n\nshe followed her, and made the important communication. Its  effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs.  Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it\n\nunder many, many minutes that she could comprehend what\n\nshe heard; though not in general backward to credit what was  for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a  lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget\n\nabout in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless\n\nherself.\n\n\n\n\"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr.\n\nDarcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh!\n\nmy sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What\n\npin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's  is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so pleased--so happy.  Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my dear\n\nLizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much\n\nbefore. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house  in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters  married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of\n\nme. I shall go distracted.\"\n\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away. But before she had\n\nbeen three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.\n\n\"My dearest child,\" she cried, \"I can think of nothing else!  Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a  Lord! And a special licence. You must and shall be married\n\nby a special licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish\n\nMr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-\n\nmorrow.\"\n \nThis was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the\n\ngentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though\n\nin the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure  of her relations' consent, there was still something to be\n\n\n\nwished for. But the morrow passed off much better than she  expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her\n\nintended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him,\n\nunless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark\n\nher deference for his opinion.\n\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking\n\npains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon\n\nassured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.\n\n\"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\" said he.\n\n\"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like\n\nYOUR husband quite as well as Jane's.\"\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 60.\n\nElizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. \"How could you begin?\" said she. \"I can\n\ncomprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once\n\nmade a beginning; but what could set you off in the first\n\nplace?\"\n\n\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the\n\nwords, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in\n\nthe middle before I knew that I HAD begun.\"\n\n\"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my\n\nmanners--my behaviour to YOU was at least always bordering\n\non the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather\n\nwishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere; did you\n\nadmire me for my impertinence?\"\n\n\"For the liveliness of your mind, I did.\"\n\n\"You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very\n\nlittle less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of  deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted with the  women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking\n\nfor YOUR approbation alone. I roused, and interested you,\n\nbecause I was so unlike THEM. Had you not been really  amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the  pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always\n\n\n\nnoble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the  persons who so assiduously courted you. There--I have saved\n\nyou the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things\n\nconsidered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be  sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of  THAT when they fall in love.\"\n\n\"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane\n\nwhile she was ill at Netherfield?\"\n \n\"Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But\n\nmake a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under\n\nyour protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as\n\npossible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for  teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I  shall begin directly by asking you what made you so\n\nunwilling to come to the point at last. What made you so shy\n\nof me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why,  especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not\n\ncare about me?\"\n \n\"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no\n\nencouragement.\"\n\n\"But I was embarrassed.\"\n \n\"And so was I.\"\n\n\n\n\"You might have talked to me more when you came to\n\ndinner.\"\n \n\"A man who had felt less, might.\"\n\n\"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to  give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I  wonder how long you WOULD have gone on, if you had been\n\nleft to yourself. I wonder when you WOULD have spoken, if I\n\nhad not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your  kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. TOO MUCH, I\n\nam afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort\n\nsprings from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have\n\nmentioned the subject. This will never do.\"\n\n\"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be\n\nperfectly fair. Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to\n\nseparate us were the means of removing all my doubts. I am\n\nnot indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of  expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for  any opening of your's. My aunt's intelligence had given me\n\nhope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.\"\n\n\"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to  make her happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what  did you come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride\n\nto Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any\n\nmore serious consequence?\"\n\n\n\n\"My real purpose was to see YOU, and to judge, if I could,\n\nwhether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed\n\none, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your\n\nsister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the\n\nconfession to him which I have since made.\"\n \n\"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady\n\nCatherine what is to befall her?\"\n \n\"I am more likely to want more time than courage,  Elizabeth. But it ought to done, and if you will give me a  sheet of paper, it shall be done directly.\"\n\n\"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you\n\nand admire the evenness of your writing, as another young  lady once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer  neglected.\"\n\nFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy\n\nwith Mr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet  answered Mrs. Gardiner's long letter; but now, having THAT\n\nto communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she\n\nwas almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had\n\nalready lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as\n\nfollows:\n \n\"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I\n\nought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of\n\nparticulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You\n\n\n\nsupposed more than really existed. But NOW suppose as  much as you choose; give a loose rein to your fancy, indulge\n\nyour imagination in every possible flight which the subject\n\nwill afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you  cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise  him a great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you,\n\nagain and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so\n\nsilly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We  will go round the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in  the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not\n\none with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only\n\nsmiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world  that he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley\n\nat Christmas. Yours, etc.\"\n \nMr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different\n\nstyle; and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent\n\nto Mr. Collins, in reply to his last.\n\n\"DEAR SIR,\n \n\"I must trouble you once more for congratulations.\n\nElizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady  Catherine as well as you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.\n\n\"Yours sincerely, etc.\"\n\n\n\nMiss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and\n\ninsincere. She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express\n\nher delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.  Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though  feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much\n\nkinder answer than she knew was deserved.\n \nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and\n\nall her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.\n\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to\n\nLucas Lodge. The reason of this sudden removal was soon\n\nevident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly  angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte,  really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the\n\nstorm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her\n\nfriend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the  course of their meetings she must sometimes think the  pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to\n\nall the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. He\n\nbore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even\n\nlisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on  carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and\n\n\n\nexpressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St.  James's, with very decent composure. If he did shrug his\n\nshoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.\n\nMrs. Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with\n\nthe familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet,\n\nwhenever she DID speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her  respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to  make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield\n\nhim from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious\n\nto keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom  he might converse without mortification; and though the  uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the\n\nseason of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope\n\nof the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time  when they should be removed from society so little pleasing  to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party\n\nat Pemberley.\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n\nChapter 61.\n\nHappy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which  Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.  With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs.\n\nBingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I\n\ncould say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment  of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her  children produced so happy an effect as to make her a\n\nsensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her\n\nlife; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might  not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that  she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.\n\nMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his\n\naffection for her drew him oftener from home than anything  else could do. He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially  when he was least expected.\n\nMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a\n\ntwelvemonth. So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton  relations was not desirable even to HIS easy temper, or HER  affectionate heart. The darling wish of his sisters was then\n\ngratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to\n\nDerbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\n\nKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her\n\ntime with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what\n\n\n\nshe had generally known, her improvement was great. She  was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed\n\nfrom the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper\n\nattention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and  less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia's society  she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham\n\nfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the\n\npromise of balls and young men, her father would never\n\nconsent to her going.\n\nMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and\n\nshe   was   necessarily   drawn   from   the   pursuit   of\n\naccomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite unable to sit  alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she  could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was\n\nno longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters'\n\nbeauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she\n\nsubmitted to the change without much reluctance.\n\nAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no\n\nrevolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with\n\nphilosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become  acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had  before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was\n\nnot wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on\n\nto make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth  received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by\n\n\n\nhis wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.\n\nThe letter was to this effect:\n \n\"MY DEAR LIZZY,\n\n\"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do  my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great  comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else\n\nto do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would\n\nlike a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall  have quite money enough to live upon without some help.  Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year;\n\nbut however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had\n\nrather not.\n \n\"Yours, etc.\"\n \nAs it happened that Elizabeth had MUCH rather not, she\n\nendeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and\n\nexpectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her  power to afford, by the practice of what might be called  economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent\n\nthem. It had always been evident to her that such an income as\n\ntheirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in  their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very  insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their\n\nquarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to\n\nfor some little assistance towards discharging their bills. Their  manner of living, even when the restoration of peace\n\n\n\ndismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. They  were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap\n\nsituation, and always spending more than they ought. His\n\naffection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a\n\nlittle longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she  retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had\n\ngiven her.\n\nThough Darcy could never receive HIM at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in his profession.  Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was\n\ngone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the\n\nBingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even  Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.\n\nMiss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's\n\nmarriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of  visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder  than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as\n\nheretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.\n\nPemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each other even as well as they intended.\n\nGeorgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth;\n\nthough at first she often listened with an astonishment  bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to\n\n\n\nher brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect  which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object\n\nof open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had\n\nnever before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she  began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with  her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister\n\nmore than ten years younger than himself.\n\nLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which\n\nannounced its arrangement, she sent him language so very\n\nabusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all  intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's  persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and\n\nseek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on\n\nthe part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her  affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife\n\nconducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at\n\nPemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had\n\nreceived, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but\n\nthe visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\n\nWith the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate\n\nterms. Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they\n\nwere both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the  persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the  means of uniting them.\n\n\n\nMore classics here:\n \nE b d\n\nE - B o o k s D i r e c t o r y . c o m\n\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n   \n -  page-1 \n -  page-16 \n -  page-31 \n -  page-46 \n -  page-61 \n -  page-76 \n -  page-91 \n -  page-106 \n -  page-121 \n -  page-136 \n -  page-151 \n -  page-166 \n -  page-181 \n -  page-196 \n -  page-211 \n -  page-226 \n -  page-241 \n -  page-256 \n -  page-271 \n -  page-286 \n -  page-301 \n -  page-316 \n -  page-331 \n -  page-346 \n -  page-361 \n -  page-376 \n -  page-391 \n -  page-406 \n -  page-421 \n -  page-436 \n -  page-451 \n -  page-466 \n -  page-481 \n -  page-496 \n -  page-511 \n -  page-526", "supersummary": {"overview": "Published anonymously in 1813 by English author Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice is an example of a “novel of manners,” which presents a realistic picture of society through the customs and manners of everyday life. By depicting complex relationships between landowners and tradesmen, those with old money and the nouveaux riche, and men and women, Pride and Prejudice offers a glimpse into the social structures of early 19th-century England. The novel’s primary focus is marriage, specifically in its capacity as the most practical way for women of small fortune to ensure their financial security. It touches on how property laws make women dependent on male relations and on the narrow standards for women’s behavior. It also comments on the complicated social hierarchy revolving around land ownership and etiquette. Many characters in Pride and Prejudice seek to make themselves appear socially superior and to ingratiate themselves to the wealthy; the novel, however, argues that true good breeding entails integrity, kindness, and humility.", "summary": "Mrs. Bennet hopes Mr. Bingley, a wealthy young bachelor who has just moved to a large nearby estate called Netherfield, will marry one of her five daughters. The Bennet family meets Bingley and his party at a ball in the town of Meryton. Bingley is amiable and friendly, and he and Jane, the oldest daughter, form an instant attachment. His sisters, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, are haughty and superior. Mr. Darcy, a friend of Mr. Bingley’s, refuses to dance with anyone outside his party. At one point, Elizabeth, the second daughter of the Bennet family, overhears Darcy sneering that she is not attractive enough for him.\nJane and Bingley’s affection grows over time. Meanwhile, Darcy becomes begrudgingly attracted to Elizabeth. When Jane falls ill while visiting the Bingley sisters at Netherfield and is forced to stay several nights, Elizabeth is invited to stay with Jane. The Bingley sisters mock Elizabeth and Jane behind their backs, joking about the inferior social status of their relatives. Each night, Darcy and Elizabeth engage in witty banter, verbally sparing over a variety of topics. With every conversation, Darcy is more and more entranced by her intelligence. His attraction to Elizabeth frustrates Miss Bingley, who wants to marry him herself.\nAs he has no sons, Mr. Bennet’s estate, Longbourn, has been entailed to his cousin, Mr. Collins, who will inherit it after Mr. Bennet’s death. Mr. Collins, an obtuse, pompous clergyman, visits Longbourn, to meet the family. Mrs. Bennet is thrilled when she learns that Mr. Collins intends to marry one of her daughters because it will ensure Longbourn remain in her family.\nThe Bennet daughters enjoy going to Meryton, where a regiment of officers is stationed. There, they meet the handsome Mr. Wickham, who charms Elizabeth. Elizabeth is incensed by Wickham’s report that his father was Darcy’s father’s steward and that Darcy defied his father’s will by preventing Wickham from receiving a living in the clergy.\nAt a ball held at Netherfield, Elizabeth is surprised when Darcy asks her to dance. When she confronts him about having injured Wickham, Darcy suggests Wickham’s character isn’t what it appears. Throughout the night, her family’s brash behavior mortifies Elizabeth. The next day, Mr. Collins proposes to Elizabeth, and she vehemently declines, infuriating Mrs. Bennet.\nJane receives a letter from Miss Bingley stating that the whole party has left Netherfield for London and that she hopes Bingley will marry Darcy’s sister. Jane is disappointed, stating she must have misunderstood Bingley’s feelings; Elizabeth is livid, believing Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst think Jane isn’t good enough for their brother.\nWhen Elizabeth’s best friend, Charlotte Lucas, accepts a proposal from Mr. Collins, Elizabeth is disappointed in Charlotte for settling in a marriage that could never make her happy. Charlotte, a plain woman of small fortune, assures her she seeks only financial security in marriage. After Charlotte and Mr. Collins marry, Elizabeth visits them at Hunsford. Mr. Collins is delighted to introduce Elizabeth to his haughty patron Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who happens to be Darcy’s aunt. Soon, Darcy arrives with his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam. During his stay, Darcy goes to great lengths to see Elizabeth.\nElizabeth is infuriated when Colonel Fitzwilliam reveals that Darcy intervened in Bingley and Jane’s romance. Later that day, Darcy visits Elizabeth, confesses his love, spells out his objections to her family, and asks for her hand in marriage. Disgusted, she rejects him, citing his insults to her family, his role in Jane’s unhappiness, and his ill treatment of Wickham. Stunned and angry, he leaves.\nThe next day, Darcy gives her a letter, in which he explains that he interfered in Bingley and Jane’s relationship because he believed Jane’s affection didn’t match Bingley’s. He also relates that Wickham turned down the living in the clergy and squandered his money, then attempted to elope with Darcy’s young sister. Elizabeth realizes Darcy is telling the truth and that she’s exhibited the same prejudice she’s accused him of.\nBack home, Lydia, the flirtatious youngest Bennet daughter, goes with friends to Brighton, where the officers are now stationed. Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, take a trip to Derbyshire, where Darcy’s estate, Pemberley, is situated. At Pemberley, they meet Darcy’s housekeeper, who shares stories of his kindness and generosity. Reeling from this information, they explore the beautiful grounds until they encounter Darcy himself, who has come home earlier than expected. Elizabeth notices that his manner is gentler: he’s kind to her aunt and uncle, and he asks to introduce her to his sister. Darcy, his sister, and Bingley visit the next morning. Elizabeth likes Miss Darcy instantly and is happy that Bingley still loves Jane. She finds herself feeling more and more warmly toward Darcy.\nWhen Elizabeth receives a letter from Jane informing her that Lydia has run away with Wickham, she is forced to confess the news to Darcy. She returns home, lamenting that he could never love her now. Mr. Gardiner goes to London to find Lydia and Wickham; the family hopes to make the couple marry to avoid the shame of them living together out of wedlock. After the wedding, Elizabeth learns Darcy paid Wickham’s large debts to convince him to marry Lydia. She is overwhelmed by his kindness and hopes he did it for her.\nBingley and Darcy return to Netherfield, and Bingley proposes to Jane. One day, Elizabeth is surprised to receive a visit from Lady Catherine, who says she’s heard that Elizabeth is going to marry Darcy and demands that she promise never to do so. Elizabeth refuses to make this promise. When Elizabeth next sees Darcy at Longbourn, she thanks him for helping Lydia, and the two confess their love. Darcy explains how he’d taken her criticism to heart and how his hope was revived when Lady Catherine told him Elizabeth had refused to promise she wouldn’t marry him.\nOnce married, Elizabeth is glad to move to Pemberley, especially once Jane and Bingley move to an estate nearby. Lydia frequently appeals to Jane and Elizabeth for money. Miss Darcy lives at Pemberley, and she and Elizabeth become good friends. Elizabeth enjoys visits from Mr. Bennet and the Gardiners.", "url": "https://www.supersummary.com/pride-and-prejudice/", "author": "Jane Austen", "characters": {"Elizabeth Bennet": "As the protagonist of Pride and Prejudice, Elizabeth has the most complex journey. Her observation is keen and her wit sharp, making her arguably Mr. Bennet’s favorite, a respite from his “silly and ignorant” (7) other daughters. She has “a lively, playful disposition” (13) and is “not formed for ill-humour [sic]” (87); she laughs off Darcy’s comment to Bingley that she is merely “tolerable” (13), and she quickly overcomes her sorrow when Wickham is absent from the Netherfield ball. When she is unable to convince her father to forbid Lydia from going to Brighton, she decides not “to fret over unavoidable evils,” for “[i]t [is] not in her nature […] to increase her vexations by dwelling on them” (217). Her evenness of temper establishes her as dependable and rational, highlighting her grave error in relying on her emotions when judging Darcy and Wickham, the charismatic solider posted in the nearby town of Meryton.As the two oldest Bennet daughters, Jane and Elizabeth have a particularly close relationship. However, Elizabeth has “more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister” (16), making her more likely to question people’s motives, often seeing truths Jane does not. Unlike Jane, who sees nothing but the good in people, Elizabeth easily sees through the Bingley sisters’ false charm, recognizing their attempts to keep Jane and Bingley apart even when Jane believes their separation is the result of innocent misunderstandings. Keenly attuned to tone and skillful at reading between the lines, Elizabeth senses Mr. Collins’s ridiculousness from his letter, asking her father if he can “be a sensible man” (62). Elizabeth is equally incisive about herself as she is about others. She is willing to concede to Mrs. Gardiner “the imprudence” (139) of pursuing a relationship with Wickham; later, when Wickham pursues a wealthier young lady, Miss King, her lack of pain inspires Elizabeth to acknowledge that she was not, in fact, “much in love” (144). Elizabeth’s ability to parse people’s meanings and motivations makes her failure to correctly assess Wickham’s character all the more remarkable.Elizabeth expects to be treated as “a rational creature” rather than a modest, “elegant female” (105)—or worse, a husband’s property. Early in the novel, her point of view is contrasted with that of Charlotte Lucas, who believes women in financial straits do not have the luxury of falling in love. Elizabeth expects more: she disagrees that marriage’s sole purpose is convenience and is grossly disappointed when Charlotte accepts Mr. Collins’s proposal. She finds “humiliating” the picture of Charlotte “disgracing herself” (120), believing her to have sacrificed common sense and happiness for mere material gain. She herself ultimately marries for love, proving that despite the unfortunate marriages around her, one need not settle for mediocrity. Elizabeth expects to be a partner in her marriage—she shocks Darcy’s young sister by teasing him as an equal—thus shattering societal expectations that wives, in Mr. Collins’s words, should not be “headstrong” lest they negatively impact the “happiness in the marriage state” (106).Despite her strong opinions, Elizabeth shows willingness to grow and learn by overcoming her prejudice of Darcy and acknowledging that she’d misinterpreted his character. Already predisposed to dislike Darcy, she believes everything Wickham tells her about him, finding Wickham too handsome to lie and falling victim to the same prejudice of which she accuses Darcy. She confronts Darcy over Wickham without ever hearing his side of the story, rejecting his proposal in part because of what she believes he’s done to Wickham. She reads Darcy’s letter “[w]ith a strong prejudice against everything he might say” (192) and at first is angry over his assessment of Jane and her family; however, a careful, rational reading of his letter forces her to acknowledge her how her previous thinking had been faulty, ultimately leading her to reevaluate her opinions. She is horrified to discover her own vanity and prejudices, acknowledging that she “never knew myself” (196) and absorbing the lesson, which is “humiliating” but “just” (196). Over the months that follow, she realizes the extent of her misconception, taking seriously the warm commendations of Darcy’s servant Mrs. Reynolds and considering the kindness he’s exhibited toward his sister. Her reevaluation of his character makes her newly nervous around him, especially as she comes to understand that he is, in fact, “exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her” (289). The gradual softening of her feelings toward him shows an open-mindedness that earns her happiness when he proposes a second time.", "Fitzwilliam Darcy": "The people of Meryton dislike Darcy almost immediately after he arrives at Netherfield. At the Meryton ball, people are impressed with his “handsome features, noble mien, and the report […] of his having ten thousand a year” (12), until his manners are determined to be proud. Unlike his friend Bingley, he doesn’t speak to or dance with anyone outside his party. By the end of the evening, the town has decided that “[h]e [is] the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world” (12). It’s also at the Meryton ball that he insults Elizabeth, telling Bingley, loudly enough for her to hear, that he finds her merely “tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me” (13).The more Darcy sees Elizabeth, the more he appreciates her intelligence and independence. However, of the belief that a woman’s poor relations “must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world” (36), he finds his increasing admiration of her “mortifying” (24), and the “inferiority of her connections” (51) prevents him from pursuing her. It’s an obstacle frequently brought to his attention by Miss Bingley, who desires him for herself. When Miss Bingley attempts to dampen his attraction for Elizabeth by reminding him of her low connections or independence, Darcy defends Elizabeth; for example, when Miss Bingley mocks Elizabeth for walking three miles to Netherfield, Darcy says he believes her eyes “were brightened by the exercise” (36).His proud, off-putting behavior makes it easy for Elizabeth to believe Wickham’s accusations against him. However, when Elizabeth confronts him about Wickham at the Netherfield ball, Darcy declines to similarly smear Wickham, merely warning her that judging his character at that moment “would reflect no credit on either” (91) of them. In this way Darcy, though not faultless, shows himself to have integrity.His proposal to Elizabeth focuses more on his concern over “the inferiority of your connections” (182) than on his love for her, and after she soundly rejects him, he leaves wounded. Though his letter to her serves primarily to defend himself against her accusations regarding Jane and Wickham—he writes that his “character” forces him to “demand” of her “justice” that she read it (185)—when she meets him at Pemberley she finds his attitude much changed. He is kinder and gentler, and he goes out of his way to make her aunt and uncle feel welcome, even inviting Mr. Gardiner to fish at Pemberley and introducing Elizabeth to his sister. He joins Bingley at Longbourn, sanctioning a relationship he’d previously worked to break up, and he admirably tolerates the frivolous behavior of Elizabeth’s mother. Though he makes these changes for Elizabeth—he demonstrates the depth of his love for her by paying off Wickham’s debts, anonymously—they show that, like Elizabeth, he is not so proud as to be incapable of self-improvement. Having spent “many months” pondering his “unpardonable” (341) behavior, he proves to have taken her criticisms seriously, becoming a fairer, more tolerant man.", "Jane Bennet": "Jane is the eldest Bennet daughter. Described as a great beauty, she is the closest in age and temperament to Elizabeth, though the two differ dramatically in perspective. Whereas Elizabeth questions people’s motives and is more comfortable coming to unpleasant conclusion about their characters, Jane always sees the good in people and is nearly incapable of accepting that they act out of selfishness or malice. When the Bingley party leaves Netherfield, Jane argues that Miss Bingley could never deceive anyone and that she must simply be warning Jane, out of the goodness of her heart, that Bingley doesn’t love her. Rather than accept that Miss Bingley may be duplicitous, Jane blames herself for misinterpreting Bingley’s affection. When Elizabeth tells her about Darcy’s letter, Jane tries “to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other” (210). When Elizabeth complains that people continue to disappoint her, Jane pleads with Elizabeth not to indulge in thoughts that “will ruin your happiness” and to remember that “difference of situation and temper” inspire people to make decisions Elizabeth might not (131). Her optimism extends even to Wickham: before Lydia and Wickham are found, Jane never loses hope that they eventually will marry, and once they do marry, she insists Wickham must have some affection for Lydia. Her good heart and refusal to criticize make her a good match for the buoyantly amiable Bingley and inspire her father, upon her engagement, to pronounce that they are both “so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income” (323).", "Charlotte Lucas": "Elizabeth’s best friend, Charlotte is described as “plain” and is 27 years old, an age when her brothers worry about her “dying an old maid” (117). She often reflects more traditional views, telling Elizabeth, for example, that Darcy’s wealth justifies his pride. Early in the novel, she warns Elizabeth that Jane should show Bingley more affection than she otherwise would, for Jane’s “uniform cheerfulness of manner” (22) may suggest to Bingley that she does not love him. When Elizabeth argues that Jane barely knows Bingley, Charlotte tells her that “[w]hen she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses” (22). Though her point of view is set up to contrast with Elizabeth’s, she is ultimately proved correct when Darcy writes to Elizabeth that he encouraged Bingley to leave Netherfield because he didn’t believe Jane’s affection matched his.Charlotte admits to marrying Mr. Collins because she is “not romantic” (120); she believes marriage to be merely the most practical option, the “pleasantest preservative from want,” for “well-educated young women of small fortune” (117). Her vision of marriage as a mercenary arrangement inspires her to warn Elizabeth not to let her “fancy for Wickham” affect her treatment of Darcy, “a man of ten times his consequence” (88). She believes “[h]appiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance” (23) and that people are better off not knowing their partners’ flaws before marriage. . Charlotte manages her life with Mr. Collins with grace, though, enjoying the comfort of her house and devising routines that put her as little in Mr. Collins’s company as possible; she also quickly learns to bear Lady Catherine’s many suggestions on how she run her household.Charlotte’s acceptance of women’s subversion illustrates the lack of options for women during Austen’s day. Unhopeful that she will be able to achieve both love and financial security in marriage, and seeing marriage as her only refuge from destitution, she does what she feels is most advantageous for a woman in her circumstances. Unlike Elizabeth, she does not fight against the patriarchal system that makes women dependent.", "Mrs. Bennet": "Mrs. Bennet is loud, silly, and full of folly and obsessed with marrying her daughters to rich men. Her relationship with her husband is combative; Mr. Bennet often gives into her whims in order to preserve peace and quiet. When she doesn’t get her way, she complains of her “poor nerves” or that “nobody is on my side” (108). Mrs. Bennet’s unsubtle behavior frequently embarrasses Elizabeth; for example, she scolds Darcy for disparaging the country, inadvertently revealing her provinciality, and at the Netherfield ball, she speaks freely about how Jane’s marriage to Bingley would open the doors for her other daughters to marry rich men. Her scheme to stay late at the Netherfield ball, like her scheme to force Jane to recover from her illness there, is transparent to everyone and is therefore counterproductive to her goal of endearing her family to the Bingleys.Worse, however, is Mrs. Bennet’s indulgence of her youngest daughters’ frivolity, which ultimately leads to Lydia’s elopement with Wickham. Remembering fondly a time when she, too, “liked a red coat myself very well” (30), she encourages her daughters to chase after officers, pleading with Mr. Bennet to bring the family on a trip to Brighton when the officers leave Meryton. When Lydia marries Wickham, rather than feel shame over Lydia’s behavior or gratitude for Mr. Gardiner’s generosity in helping, Mrs. Bennet chastises Mr. Bennet for refusing to send Lydia money for clothes. Oblivious to others’ great efforts to achieve this marriage, Mrs. Bennet sees nothing but the fact that she finally has a daughter married.Mrs. Bennet feels in competition with other women seeking to marry off their daughters and even sends Jane to Netherfield in the rain in the hopes she’ll grow ill and need to stay there. Mrs. Bennet is furious with Mr. Collins, who will inherit Longbourn after Mr. Bennet’s death, but she is thrilled when he decides to marry one of her daughters. When Elizabeth rejects him, Mrs. Bennet calls her “undutiful,” stating she will never speak to her again and that she doesn’t know “who is to maintain you when your father is dead” (108). Mrs. Bennet’s obsession with marriage, though on first glance petty, is not wholly unwarranted. Her frustration with the entail of Longbourn, which makes her daughters dependent on Mr. Collins, is grounded in legitimate concern—a concern reflected in the Lucas sons’ relief that they will not have to look after Charlotte in her old age. With no sons to support them after Mr. Bennet’s death, Mrs. Bennet has reason to wonder what will happen to her unmarried daughters. She therefore is furious at the thought of Charlotte, through Mr. Collins, becoming the mistress of Longbourn, at which time she could choose “to turn herself and her daughters out of the house” (124). It’s perhaps no surprise that, although Elizabeth fears she’ll be devastated by her engagement to Darcy, Mrs. Bennet is delighted, exclaiming about “how rich and how great you will be,” how many “carriages you will have” (351). Her dislike of Darcy, which she’d made abundantly clear, suddenly turns to awe when she learns he will care for one of her daughters.", "Mr. Bennet": "Mr. Bennet was “captivated by youth and beauty” (221) and “had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her” (221).Knowing he will not find intellectual fulfillment or happiness in his marriage, he’s been committed to finding “amusement” in her “ignorance and folly” (221). He finds pleasure in teasing his wife, who usually misses his jokes. Mr. Bennet spends as much time as possible in his library, where he is “always sure of leisure and tranquility” (69). Though frequently frustrated with the silliness of his wife and youngest daughters, he finds comfort with his oldest daughters, especially Elizabeth, whom he sees as having “something more of quickness than her sisters” (7).Mr. Bennet enjoys playing tricks on his wife and daughters, for example deliberately not telling them he’s already visited Bingley and watching their excitement when he reveals this information. He also teases them with quick turns of words, such as when he announces the upcoming visit of Mr. Collins, “who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases” (60). Humor is often his defense against his wife’s frivolity; for example, when Jane, according to Mrs. Bennet’s plan, is too ill to leave Netherfield, he tells his wife that “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders” (32).His tendency to laugh at or ignore his family’s follies, however, brings on folly of its own. He doesn’t stop Kitty and Lydia from visiting the officers, even though he finds this behavior “uncommonly foolish” (31). His lackadaisical attitude is noticed by Darcy, who in his letter to Elizabeth apologetically suggests her father is as guilty of “want of propriety” (187) as her mother. Elizabeth tries to warn him of “the very great disadvantage to us all” that has “already arisen” from “Lydia’s unguarded and imprudent manner,” only for her father to joke about which lovers Lydia has “frightened away” (216). He allows Lydia to go to Brighton because they “shall have no peace at Longbourn” (217) if he forbids her; he even suggests it would be advantageous if Lydia embarrasses herself at Brighton, for she would be far away from them. His prioritizing quiet over discipline and his failure to see the danger of his wife and daughters’ behavior make Lydia’s elopement with Wickham possible. His gentle-handed manner of discipline is reminiscent of his looseness with finances: he never “laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children,” instead “spending his whole income” (286).Mr. Bennet undergoes a brief period of regret when Lydia runs off with Wickham, telling Elizabeth he deserves to feel the pain he’s caused and refusing to indulge his wife in visiting Bingley upon Bingley’s second arrival at Netherfield. He also wishes he’d had the discipline and foresight to put money aside each year, for if he had, he’d avoid being in debt to Mr. Gardiner, who he believes has paid Wickham’s debts. As the conclusion of the novel draws near, he regains his joking attitude, saying he loves Wickham most of all his sons-in-law. However, there is a note of seriousness in his conversation with Elizabeth regarding her engagement: he objects not to Darcy himself but to the possibility that Elizabeth is marrying him for the wrong reasons, for given her “disposition” and her “lively talents” (349), she would be forever unhappy in an unsatisfying marriage. He begs her: “My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life” (350). His subtle suggestion is that he knows what it’s like to feel no joy with his partner and that he can’t bear the thought of his favorite daughter suffering as he has.", "Mr. Collins": "Mr. Collins benefits from a patriarchal system in which men of means occupy positions of power of they don’t always deserve. In addition, or perhaps as a consequence, he is a believer in the social hierarchy, and sees the upper classes as intrinsically superior.Mr. Collins adheres to the belief that women are mild, delicate, and subservient. For example, he brags of his offering to Miss de Bourgh “those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies” (66) and lectures Lydia that she should read sermons on female behavior. Nowhere is this belief more evident than in his approach to marriage. In looking for a wife, Mr. Collins moves from Jane to Elizabeth to Charlotte without a care, easily allowing each woman to replace the one before as if they are all the same. Just as he assesses the Bennets’ house and furniture “as his own future property” (64), he comes to marriage with hopes of his own happiness. A wife is a possession with which to please Lady Catherine; marriage is a way for him to serve as an “example of matrimony in his parish” (101).His insistence that Elizabeth’s rejections are the result of the “natural delicacy” (101) typical of “elegant females” (104) demonstrates not only how poorly he understands her character, but also the ideal of feminine “modesty” (101). Though Elizabeth begs him to treat her as “a rational creature” (105), he refuses to take her seriously—and tells Mrs. Bennet that if Elizabeth is “liable to such defects of temper” (106)—that is, the inclination to voice her opinions—he would prefer not to marry her after all, for “she could not contribute much to my felicity” (106). By casting Elizabeth as unladylike, he is able to see her rejecting him as her flaw rather than accept it as a reflection on himself. Importantly, his comment to Elizabeth that he could have chosen from “many amiable young women” (102) in his own neighborhood, though arrogant at first glance, in fact proves true when he almost immediately becomes engaged to Charlotte Lucas.Mr. Collins speaks constantly of his patron Lady Catherine de Bourgh, bragging about his closeness to her at every opportunity, clearly missing that her constantly offering her opinion is not a beneficent condescension on her part but in fact a demonstration of arrogant entitlement. He is grateful for any attention from Lady Catherine, interpreting her invitations and even her criticism as evidence of his own importance. It is little wonder Mr. Collins indulges Lady Catherine in her desire “to have the distinction of rank preserved” (154), for the social hierarchy that subverts him to Lady Catherine is the very hierarchy from which he benefits, through his entail of the Longbourn estate."}, "chapter_summaries": {"Volume 1, Chapter 1 Summary": "Mrs. Bennet excitedly informs her husband that Mr. Bingley, a “single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year” (6) has rented Netherfield Park, a nearby estate. According to Mrs. Bennet, this is “a fine thing” (6) for their five daughters. When Mr. Bennet asks why, Mrs. Bennet, exasperated, suggests Bingley may fall in love with one of them. Though she adamantly encourages her husband to visit Bingley, Mr. Bennet is in no hurry, telling her she and the girls may visit Bingley without him; he even suggests the girls go alone, for as Mrs. Bennet is “as handsome as any of them” (6),Bingley may fall in love with her, instead. Mrs. Bennet insists that a woman with “five grown up daughters” does not have the luxury of “thinking of her own beauty” (6).Mrs. Bennet’s desire for her husband to visit Bingley is made greater by the fact that their neighbors, Sir William and Lady Lucas, are going. Mr. Bennet is unmoved, insisting he will “send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls” (6); he adds that he personally prefers their daughter Elizabeth, for Elizabeth “has something more of quickness than her sisters” (7), who “are silly and ignorant like other girls” (7). When Mrs. Bennet accuses her husband of not considering her nerves, Mr. Bennet assures her that he has “a high respect” for her nerves, which are his “old friends” (7).", "Volume 1, Chapter 2 Summary": "Mr. Bennet “had always intended” to visit Bingley and in fact is “among the earliest” of Bingley’s visitors, but he keeps his intention from his wife (8). When Elizabeth is fixing her hat, Mr. Bennet tells her he hopes Bingley will like it; Mrs. Bennet “resentfully” reminds him that they “are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes” because they haven’t met him (8). When Elizabeth suggests their friend, Mrs. Long, can introduce them, Mrs. Bennet tartly complains that Mrs. Long, “a selfish, hypocritical woman” (8), will not introduce them because she is trying to marry off her two nieces. In her frustration, she snaps at her daughter, Kitty, telling her to stop coughing and to “[h]ave a little compassion on my nerves” (8). Mr. Bennet, playing along, states that “Kitty has no discretion in her coughs” (8).Mr. Bennet asks their daughter, Mary, for her opinion; Mary, “a young lady of deep reflection” (9), finds herself unable to come up with a reply. When Mrs. Bennet exclaims that she is “sick of Mr. Bingley,” Mr. Bennet tells her he wishes he had known, for he would not have visited Bingley that morning. The resulting “astonishment […] [is] just that he wished” (9). Mrs. Bennet, overjoyed, states that she knew he loved his daughters too much not to do as she’d asked, and that Kitty is now free to cough as much as she likes.After telling her daughters that “making new acquaintances” is “not so pleasant” but that she does it for their sakes, Mrs. Bennet suggests Bingley will dance with Lydia, the youngest daughter, at the upcoming ball (10). The family then discusses plans to see Bingley in the future.", "Volume 1, Chapter 3 Summary": "Lady Lucas and her husband find Bingley “quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable” (10), and he is willing to attend the next ball. The women are pleased, for “[t]o be fond of dancing [is] a certain step towards falling in love” (10-11). Mrs. Bennet tells Mr. Bennet that she will “have nothing to wish for” if she can arrange for one of her daughters to marry Bingley and for the rest to be “equally well married” (11).A few days later, Bingley visits Mr. Bennet in his library. He is disappointed not to have met the Bennet daughters, “of whose beauty he had heard much” (11), but the daughters manage to catch a glimpse of him from an upstairs window.Bingley is soon joined by his two sisters, brother-in-law, and friend, all of whom attend the ball. Bingley is attractive and friendly, and his sisters are “fine” (11) and fashionable. His friend, Mr. Darcy, is tall, handsome, and noble-looking. Also, according to rumor, his estate earns him £10,000 a year. He’s admired for much of the evening, until he is “discovered to be proud” and “above being pleased,” with “a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance” (12). Whereas Bingley is “lively and unreserved” (12), offering to give a ball at Netherfield, Darcy associates only with the women in his own party. He appears to those in attendance the “most disagreeable man in the world” (12).Elizabeth overhears Darcy telling Bingley that she is “tolerable” but “not handsome enough to tempt me” (13) to dance. Though Elizabeth, who has “a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous,” has “no very cordial feelings towards him,” she laughingly shares the story with her friends (13).Mrs. Bennet is pleased that Bingley dances with Jane twice; Elizabeth, too, is happy for Jane. Kitty and Lydia are happy to have had partners all night. They return to their home, Longbourn, to find Mr. Bennet reading. Mrs. Bennet regales him with tales of Mr. Bingley’s charms and of his obvious admiration of Jane, the only woman whom he asked to dance twice. She pronounces Darcy “high and so conceited,” declaring Elizabeth “does not lose much by not suiting his fancy” (15).", "Volume 1, Chapters 1-3 Analysis": "The famous opening sentence—“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife” (5)—establishes that marriage will be a central theme in the novel. By stating that it is “universally acknowledged,” however, Austen suggests that this “truth” is the opinion of the town, and not necessarily of the man in question. Similarly, the following sentence—which states that “this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families” despite how “little known” (5) the man’s feelings actually are—establishes that gossip, or the meddling of outsiders, will play a role in events to come. The prevalence of gossip—such as the townspeople’s interest in how many people Bingley plans to bring to the Meryton ball—is demonstrated frequently in these chapters.Though the story is told by an omniscient narrator, Austen frequently relays information from the point-of-view of the townspeople. Darcy, who “[is] looked at with great admiration for about half the evening” until “he [is] discovered to be proud, and above his company,” is described according to the people’s opinions of him (12). When he refuses to dance with anyone outside his own party, “[h]is character [is] decided” (12): “He [is] the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world” (12). This hyperbolic statement reinforces that Pride and Prejudice will be, in part, a study of people’s opinions.Characters’ personalities are similarly revealed early on. Mrs. Bennet’s excitement over Bingley’s arrival at Netherfield is the first dialogue of the book; her husband’s passive response to her asking if he’d heard the news—Austen does not give him actual dialogue, instead simply stating that “Mr. Bennet replied that he had not” (5)—suggests that Mr. Bennet plays a more passive role than his exuberant wife.The witty banter for which Pride and Prejudice is known is demonstrated in these early chapters, often in the back-and-forth volleys between the Bennets. Mrs. Bennet often bursts with emotion, and Mr. Bennet responds with a teasing retort that goes over Mrs. Bennet’s head. When Mrs. Bennet complains that Mr. Bennet has “no compassion on my poor nerves,” Mr. Bennet counters that he has “a high respect” for her nerves, which are his “old friends” (7). In Chapter 2, he plays along with his wife’s disappointment that he won’t visit Bingley, even though the visit has already occurred—and the “astonishment” his wife and daughters express “[is] just what he wished” (9). This incident illustrates the playfulness and humor that sustain him in a household of “silly” daughters and a wife “of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper” (7). It also shows the levity with which he treats the social niceties his family takes so seriously.Despite Mr. Bennet’s teasing, Mrs. Bennet’s interest in society is not wholly irrelevant. Her comment that she “shall have nothing to wish for” if she sees her five daughters “well married” (11), while perhaps overly dramatic in the eyes of Mr. Bennet, demonstrates people’s real concern about ensuring the futures of their daughters. Because of the laws of land ownership, the Bennet daughters cannot inherit the family estate, Longbourn, when Mr. Bennet dies. The estate is entailed to a distant cousin, and this leaves the family’s future uncertain. The best chance each daughter has to be financially secure is to marry. Competition for eligible bachelors is established early: Mrs. Bennet’s desire to become friendly with Bingley is made more urgent because the Lucases are intending to do so, and she believes Mrs. Long won’t introduce them because she has nieces of her own. Though she is gossipy and frivolous, Mrs. Bennet’s urgency is inspired by real concern, a concern that Mr. Bennet appears not to acknowledge.", "Volume 1, Chapter 4 Summary": "Jane had been hesitant to speak too highly of Bingley, but when she’s alone with Elizabeth, she confesses that she finds him “sensible,” “good-humored,” and in possession of “perfect good breeding” (15). She was surprised by his invitation to dance with him twice; Elizabeth is not surprised, replying that Bingley “could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room” (15). Elizabeth notes that Jane “never see[s] a fault in any body“(16) and has never uttered a negative word about anyone. When Jane replies that she only speaks her thoughts, Elizabeth agrees, wondering how someone with such “good sense” can be “so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others” (16).Jane says that Bingley’s sisters are “very pleasing women when you converse with them” (16); Elizabeth silently disagrees, having found them “proud and conceited” (16). Though handsome and well-educated, with “a fortune of twenty thousand pounds” (16),Bingley’s sisters seem to place more importance on the fact that they are “of a respectable family in the north of England” (16) than on the fact that “their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade” (16-17).Bingley’s father had intended to purchase an estate but died before he had the chance; he’d left £100,000 to Bingley. Bingley also had intended to purchase an estate; however, he’d rented Netherfield after a half-hour’s inspection, and his sisters, though “by no means unwilling to preside at his table,” fear the “easiness of his temper” might lead him to “leave the next generation to purchase” (17).Bingley and Darcy are good friends despite their “great opposition of character” (17). Bingley is universally-liked, whereas Darcy, the more “clever” of the two, is seen as “haughty” and “reserved” (17). Also, Bingley has “the firmest reliance” on Darcy’s judgment (17). Bingley speaks highly of the Meryton dance, claiming he’s never seen more beautiful women and that everyone had been “most kind and attentive to him” (18). Darcy finds the people without “beauty” or “fashion” (18). Bingley’s sisters, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, agree with Darcy that Jane “smiled too much” (18) but approve of her nonetheless.", "Volume 1, Chapter 5 Summary": "The Bennet family is friendly with the Lucas family, at the head of which is Sir William Lucas, whose meeting with the king in his capacity as mayor had led to his knighthood and inspired him to quit the trade that had made him “a tolerable fortune” (18). Lady Lucas is “not too clever to be a valuable neighbor to Mrs. Bennet” (19), and Elizabeth and the eldest Lucas daughter Charlotte are good friends.The Lucases visit the Bennets to discuss the Meryton ball. Mrs. Bennet politely compliments Charlotte on being Bingley’s first choice in dancing partners; when Charlotte notes that Bingley preferred Jane, Mrs. Bennet feigns surprise.At Charlotte’s mention of Darcy’s rudeness toward Elizabeth, Mrs. Bennet says Mrs. Long had attempted a conversation with him and that “he seemed very angry at being spoke to” (20). Jane explains that Miss Bingley told her he is “remarkably agreeable” (20) among those he knows well. Mrs. Bennet does not believe her, telling Elizabeth she should never dance with him. Charlotte suggests his pride is made less offensive because it’s justified by his fortune and good breeding, to which Elizabeth responds that she “could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine” (20).Elizabeth’s sister, Mary, states that pride is “a very common failing” (20) and that “there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary” (21).", "Volume 1, Chapter 6 Summary": "The Bingley party visits the Bennets at Longbourn, and Jane and Bingley’s attraction becomes even clearer to Elizabeth. Charlotte worries that Jane, who shows “a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner” (22), is not showing enough affection toward Bingley; that lovers need encouragement, and Jane’s naturally-pleasant nature may not allow Bingley to see her affection for him. Jane, Charlotte says, should “make the most of every half hour” of her time with Bingley until “she is secure of him” (22). When Elizabeth comments that Jane has known Bingley for only two weeks, Charlotte states that “[h]appiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance” and that it’s better for people “to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life” (23).In the meantime, Darcy takes a begrudging interest in Elizabeth. The more he sees her, the more he’s “forced to acknowledge” that her face is “rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes” (24).Though these discoveries are “mortifying” (24), he pays close attention to her conversations with others, a habit that makes her suspect he seeks to criticize her. When he approaches her after one such conversation, she teasingly asks him if she spoke eloquently. They engage in brief, sharp banter until Charlotte requests that Elizabeth entertain them on the piano.Sir William Lucas approaches Darcy and attempts, unsuccessfully, to engage him in conversation, noting that dancing is “one of the first refinements of polished societies,” to which Darcy responds that “every savage can dance” (26). In an attempt to encourage Darcy to dance, Sir William calls to Elizabeth, asking Darcy “who could object to such a partner” (27). Though Darcy is “not unwilling” (27) to dance with Elizabeth, Elizabeth refuses.Miss Bingley complains to Darcy about the “insipidity” and “self-importance of all these people” and is surprised when he informs her he’d been thinking about the “very great pleasure” he’s finding in watching Elizabeth, who has “a pretty face” and “a pair of very fine eyes” (27). Jokingly asking about their wedding, Miss Bingley speaks of the “charming mother-in-law” he’ll acquire, continuing to tease him while he listens “with perfect indifference” (28).", "Volume 1, Chapters 4-6 Analysis": "Many characters in Pride and Prejudice have contrasts or counterparts. Jane’s tendency “to like people in general” and to “never see a fault in any body” contrasts with Elizabeth’s “quickness of observation” and more critical eye (16). Bingley, with his “pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners,” is “lively and unreserved” and dances with many partners, whereas Darcy, “forbidding” and “disagreeable,” dances only with members of his own party (12). After the Meryton ball, Bingley feels he “[has] never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life,” but Darcy “[has] seen a collection of people in whom there [is] little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he [has] felt the smallest interest” (18). Bingley’s and Jane’s sunny dispositions make them clearly well-matched. Similarly, Darcy and Elizabeth are established as sharp and cerebral, and Darcy is already attracted to the “uncommonly intelligent” look in the “beautiful expression of her dark eyes” (24).Elizabeth is also contrasted with her friend Charlotte Lucas, who in response to Elizabeth’s insistence that, after only two weeks, Jane shouldn’t expect to “be certain of the degree of her own regard” (23) for Bingley, states that couples shouldn’t know too well of each other’s “defects” (23) before marriage. With her warning that if Jane wants to marry Bingley, she should “show more affection than she feels” (22) and enjoy the luxury of falling in love with him later, Charlotte represents a practical, more sober view of marriage than Elizabeth, who places value on affection. Like Mrs. Bennet, Charlotte recognizes the importance of marrying well and the challenges young women face in establishing their futures. She reflects traditional society’s views and sees situations with a pragmatic, rather than romantic, eye, which is why Darcy’s pride “does not offend” her, for as a “fine young man with family, fortune, every thing in his favour [sic],” he has “an excuse” to be proud (20). As opposed to Elizabeth, Charlotte’s object in marriage is position and security, and though her approach may appear cold and mercenary, she arguably is better equipped to navigate the 19th-century patriarchy than Elizabeth.Contrasts in Pride and Prejudice are not limited to the dispositions of the characters. The book is rife with misunderstandings, contrasts between the truth and people’s beliefs. In Chapter 6, Elizabeth, whose pride was “mortified” (21) by Darcy’s insult, misunderstands Darcy’s interest in her conversations; though in truth he’s attempting to “know more of her,” she assumes he wishes to judge her with his “satirical eye” (24). Pride, the overabundance of it or the wounding of it, is often the catalyst for these misunderstandings, and will continue to be throughout Pride and Prejudice.Contrast also exists between people’s visions of their status and what their status actually is. Sir William Lucas exploits his lowly title to attempt camaraderie with Darcy, bragging of his connections with “superior society” (26) without recognizing the condescension in Darcy’s responses. Mrs. Bennet, who ogles over the Bingley sisters and tells her husband they are “charming women” (14), fails to see their disdain of her. Even the superior Bingley sisters inflate their status, seeming to forget “that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade” (16-17), rather than through inheritance. In a society that values title and prestige, people install themselves above others in an attempt to appear more distinguished.", "Volume 1, Chapter 7 Summary": "Mr. Bennet’s estate—its farms and properties—earns £2,000 a year. As he has no sons, it’s entailed to a distant male relation. Mrs. Bennet’s own inheritance is not enough to support her daughters. It is implied that because this male relation will inherit the estate, the security of the Bennet daughters rests in his hands.The Bennet girls enjoy walking into the town of Meryton, where their aunt, Mrs. Philips, who is Mrs. Bennet’s sister, resides. Kitty and Lydia, the two youngest, especially like to pass their unoccupied time there, visiting a hat shop and listening to gossip. When a militia regiment makes Meryton its headquarters, Kitty and Lydia are overjoyed. Every day brings officer-related gossip. Mr. Bennet says they are “two of the silliest girls in the country” (29), earning the ire of Mrs. Bennet, who assures him that their behavior is age-appropriate and that “if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him” (30).One morning a message arrives for Jane: Bingley’s sisters have invited her for dinner while the men visit Meryton. Jane asks for use of the carriage. Mrs. Bennet insists that Jane go on horseback, for “it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night” (31). When torrential rains come shortly after Jane leaves, her sisters worry, but Mrs. Bennet is delighted.The next morning, a message from Jane arrives for Elizabeth: she isn’t feeling well, and Bingley’s sisters won’t hear of her leaving until she’s better. Mr. Bennet tells his wife that if Jane dies, “it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley” (32). Elizabeth, concerned, walks to Netherfield to see Jane.She arrives covered in mud. She’s received with surprise by Bingley’s sisters and warmly by Bingley himself. Darcy is simultaneously attracted by the “brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion” (33) and doubtful that she should have come alone.Jane is too feverish to leave her room and is grateful for Elizabeth’s visit. Elizabeth appreciates the kindness with which Bingley’s sisters tend to Jane. Finally, she reluctantly says she must go, and Bingley’s sisters offer her their carriage. Seeing Jane’s distress on her sister’s leaving, they invite Elizabeth to stay at Netherfield.", "Volume 1, Chapter 8 Summary": "At dinner, Elizabeth realizes how little Bingley’s sisters care about Jane’s welfare, and her newfound warmth disappears. Bingley is genuinely concerned for Jane, and he makes Elizabeth feel welcome.After Elizabeth returns to Jane, Bingley’s sisters insult her, saying she has “no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty,” and mock her “wild” appearance that morning (35). They can’t understand why she would walk so far just because her sister has a cold. Miss Bingley adds that it shows “an abominable sort of conceited independence” (36); Bingley counters that she “looked remarkably well” (35) and that “[i]t shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing” (36).When Miss Bingley asks Darcy if Elizabeth’s “adventure” detracts from his “admiration of her fine eyes,” he says they “were brightened by the exercise” (36). Mrs. Hurst says Jane “is really a very sweet girl” but that, considering her “low connections,” a match could never take place (36). She and Miss Bingley laugh over the fact that Jane and Elizabeth’s uncles make their livings in trade. Bingley states their relations don’t matter; Darcy responds that their connections “lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world” (36). Bingley’s sisters continue laughing “at the expense of their dear friend’s vulgar relations,” then visit her in her room “[w]ith a renewal of tenderness” (36).After Jane falls asleep, Elizabeth reads in the drawing room. Miss Bingley says Elizabeth “is a great reader, and has no pleasure in any thing else,” appalling Elizabeth, who says she “deserve[s] neither such praise nor such censure” (37).Bingley, Miss Bingley, and Darcy discuss the merits of Darcy’s estate Pemberley; Darcy derides those who neglect their family libraries. Miss Bingley inquires after Darcy’s sister, commenting on how accomplished she is. Bingley expresses admiration for how accomplished young women are; Darcy proclaims he knows few women who are truly accomplished. Miss Bingley offers a list of skills a woman must possess to be considered accomplished. Darcy says a woman must possess all these skills and also “must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading” (39). When Elizabeth expresses doubt that any woman could meet all these requirements, Miss Bingley exclaims they know many such women.Later, Elizabeth informs them that Jane’s condition is worse, and they decide to send for the doctor in the morning. Bingley is genuinely distraught. His sisters express their misery, then entertain themselves by singing duets.", "Volume 1, Chapter 9 Summary": "The next morning, Elizabeth sends a note to Longbourn requesting that her mother come to Netherfield to assess Jane’s health. Mrs. Bennet arrives with Kitty and Lydia. On finding Jane’s condition not serious, she declares Jane too ill to leave Netherfield. Bingley is shocked that they’d consider removing her; Miss Bingley coldly assures Mrs. Bennet Jane will receive good care. Mrs. Bennet expresses gratitude, telling them Jane’s sweet disposition gives her patience to suffer through her illness and that she often tells her other daughters “they are nothing to her” (41).Mrs. Bennet tells Bingley she hopes he will stay at Netherfield for a while. Bingley responds that he plans to stay but that as he does everything in a hurry, if he were to leave, he “should probably be off in five minutes” (42). After Elizabeth says she isn’t surprised, Bingley comments that she is “a studier of character” (42). Darcy interjects that the country has less varied society and fewer opportunities to study character, and Mrs. Bennet, offended, emphatically disagrees, saying London has “no great advantage over the country” (43). Bingley states that both the city and the country have advantages. Mrs. Bennet comments that he has the right disposition, as opposed to Darcy, who “seem[s] to think the country [is] nothing at all” (43). Embarrassed, Elizabeth assures her mother that Darcy meant only that there are more people in the city. Mrs. Bennet asserts she dines with many people in her neighborhood. Miss Bingley casts Darcy “a very expressive smile” (43).In an attempt to change the subject, Elizabeth asks her mother about Charlotte Lucas. Mrs. Bennet raves about Sir William’s manners, saying he is “so genteel and so easy,” which is her “idea of good-breeding,” as opposed to those “who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths” (43). She adds that while Charlotte is considered plain, Jane is considered beautiful by everyone. Elizabeth and Darcy exchange a short, witty volley about poetry, eliciting a smile from Darcy.Lydia, “a favorite with her mother” (45) for her “fine complexion and good humored countenance (44-45), reminds Bingley that he’d promised to give a ball. Bingley agrees to keep his promise as soon as Jane is well. When the Bennets leave and Elizabeth returns to Jane, Bingley’s sisters mock them again. Darcy does not join in, even when Miss Bingley teases him about Elizabeth’s fine eyes.", "Volume 1, Chapter 10 Summary": "That night in the drawing room, Miss Bingley fawns over Darcy as he writes to his sister, complimenting him on “his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter” (46). She doesn’t notice his indifference.Bingley’s comment that his own letters contain errors because his “ideas flow so rapidly” (47) prompts a boisterous conversation in which Darcy claims Bingley is complimenting himself in a roundabout way, just as he was earlier when he claimed he’d leave Netherfield in five minutes. He states that as quickly as Bingley would leave Netherfield, he’d stay if a friend asked him to. Elizabeth says Darcy has proven Bingley’s point; she also asks if “the rashness” of Bingley’s hypothetical decision to leave would be “atoned for” by his “obstinacy in adhering to it” (48). Darcy replies that the hypothetical friend has offered no argument to prove the worth of his request and suggests they determine the degree of intimacy between the two friends. Bingley declares that “if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow,” he “should not pay him half so much deference” (49). Though Darcy smiles, Elizabeth perceives he’s offended and refrains from laughing.Darcy finishes his letter and asks that Elizabeth and Miss Bingley play the piano. Darcy watches Elizabeth play, and she assumes he’s finding ways to criticize her. When Miss Bingley plays, Darcy asks Elizabeth if she’d like to dance. She replies that he’s only asking so he “might have the pleasure of despising my taste” and that she “always delight[s] in overthrowing those kinds of schemes” (50). When she says he can despise her if he dares, he surprises her by replying, “Indeed I do not dare” (50). Darcy, noting the “mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner” (50), has “never been so bewitched by any woman” (51). Had it not been for “the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger” (51).Miss Bingley notices and is jealous. The next day, in the garden, she teases Darcy about Elizabeth. Her suggestions to teach his mother-in-law to keep quiet and to discourage the girls from chasing officers meet with sarcasm, which goes over her head. When Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth approach, Mrs. Hurst joins them, leaving Elizabeth to herself; when Darcy suggests walking a path that can fit all of them, Elizabeth declines, running “gaily off” (52).", "Volume 1, Chapters 7-10 Analysis": "Mrs. Bennet has been cast as self-involved and tactless; however, her comment to Bingley that “good-breeding” entails being “genteel” and “easy” (43) proves true in these chapters.Though the Bingley sisters see themselves as superior, their behavior shows them to be superficial and malicious. They mock Elizabeth for making the “nonsensical” journey to visit her sister and laugh about the condition of her clothing. Bingley responds that her behavior indicates a “pleasing” (36) love for her sister—something his own sisters can’t understand. Their deriding Elizabeth for making sacrifices to care for Jane suggests this is not something they would do for each other.Their kindness in tending to Jane is tempered by their entertaining themselves “at the expense of their dear friend’s relations” (36). Austen’s language in describing how they “solaced their wretchedness” (40) over Jane’s condition with “duets after supper” (40) is deftly ironic; Jane is clearly not their “dear friend,” and their singing after supper shows they aren’t wretched at all. Similarly, “Bingley was quite uncomfortable” (40), whereas “his sisters declared that they were miserable” (40, emphasis added). This subtle difference in language shows Bingley’s sisters say one thing and feel another. This is reinforced when, walking in the garden with Darcy, Miss Bingley mocks Elizabeth behind her back, only to fear she was “overheard” (51) as Elizabeth approaches.Elizabeth, of course, is not interested in impressing the Bingley sisters. When Mrs. Bennet tells her she “will not be fit to be seen” after walking to Netherfield, Elizabeth responds, “I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want” (32). When Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley exclude her from their walk, she “gaily” (52) declines Darcy’s invitation join them. Her indifference to the opinions of others earns her an accusation of “conceited independence” (36) from Miss Bingley.It’s precisely this independence that attracts Darcy to Elizabeth. It’s no coincidence that when Miss Bingley chides Elizabeth for taking “no pleasure” (37) in anything but books, Darcy, who “cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library” (38), states that a woman is only “accomplished” if she pursues “the improvement of her mind by extensive reading” (39).Whereas his exchanges with Miss Bingley are topical and lacking in substance, with Elizabeth he has philosophical conversations in which she challenges him to think more deeply. Miss Bingley fawns over Darcy’s letter writing and offers empty compliments, to the point where Austen describes her as Darcy’s “faithful assistant” (39). In contrast, the discussion of Bingley’s hypothetical friend pushes Darcy and Elizabeth to defend their points with thoughtfulness and passion, stimulating Darcy’s mind and resulting in his feeling “bewitched” (51).In this context, Darcy’s standoffish behavior appears the result not only of pride but also weariness. When Miss Bingley tells Darcy that Elizabeth is employing “a very mean art” (40) to “recommend” herself to him, Darcy retorts that “all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation” are “despicable” (40), clearly seeing through her own arts. Earlier chapters have already established that wealthy men are often chased and ogled. To Darcy, Elizabeth’s appeal is her “archness” (50) and refusal to flatter. As a result, Miss Bingley’s attempts to “provoke Darcy into disliking” (51) Elizabeth only put him off further.Elizabeth, however, misinterprets Darcy’s affection. When he watches her, she assumes he finds something “wrong” with her; when he asks her to dance a reel, she tells him he wants only “the pleasure of despising my taste” (50). Elizabeth’s prejudice against Darcy will result in many misunderstandings and will affect the course of their lives.", "Volume 1, Chapter 11 Summary": "That night, in the drawing room, Darcy attempts to read but is interrupted frequently by Miss Bingley, who tries in vain to draw him into conversation. She walks around the room to gain Darcy’s attention; when that fails, she invites Elizabeth to join her. Darcy finally looks up. He declines an invitation to join them and says he can imagine two reasons they are walking. Miss Bingley asks him to explain what he means. Darcy says they either have secrets to discuss or wish to show off their figures. If they have secrets, he’ll leave them alone. If they wish to show off their figures, he can watch them more easily from where he sits.Miss Bingley expresses shock and asks how they can punish him. Elizabeth replies that they can punish him by laughing at him. Miss Bingley says it’s impossible to laugh at a man of such “calmness of temper and presence of mind” and that they’ll look foolish if they “laugh without a subject” (55). Elizabeth replies that a person who can’t be laughed at has “an uncommon advantage” (55) and an unfortunate one, for she loves to laugh.Darcy says even the best of men can be laughed at by someone “whose first object in life is a joke” (55). Elizabeth says she never laughs at “what is wise and good” (55). She laughs only at “[f]ollies and nonsense” (55) and supposes he has none. Darcy says he strives “to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule” (56).Elizabeth playfully states that Darcy has no flaw. Darcy denies this, offering that his greatest flaw is that his “good opinion once lost is lost for ever” (56). Elizabeth agrees that this is a flaw but admits she can’t laugh at it. Darcy suggests every person has “a natural defect,” to which Elizabeth responds that his defect is “a propensity to hate every body” (56). Darcy smiles and tells her that her defect “is willfully [sic] to misunderstand them” (56). Miss Bingley, feeling left out, suggests they play some music.", "Volume 1, Chapter 12 Summary": "Despite Elizabeth’s pleading, Mrs. Bennet refuses to send the carriage, desiring for Elizabeth and Jane to remain at Netherfield a few days longer. Elizabeth, fearful of staying too long, asks Jane to request the use of Mr. Bingley’s carriage. The Netherfield party urges them to stay at least until the following day, and Elizabeth and Jane agree. Miss Bingley regrets this, for “her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other” (58). Bingley begs them to stay even longer, but Jane feels it’s time for them to go.Darcy is happy that Elizabeth is leaving, for “[s]he attract[s] him more than he like[s]” (58). He speaks to her as little as possible this final day, lest he reveal his attraction. Even when they are left alone together for a half-hour, he doesn’t speak to or look at her.Miss Bingley is suddenly warm upon their leaving. Mrs. Bennet, however, is disappointed at their return. Mr. Bennet is happy to see them, for family conversation “had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth” (59). Upon Jane and Elizabeth’s return, Kitty and Lydia subject them to frivolous gossip about officers.", "Volume 1, Chapter 13 Summary": "Mr. Bennet announces that a man is coming to join them for dinner and enjoys the eager questioning of his wife and daughters. He eventually tells them that the guest is Mr. Collins, the cousin to whom the Bennet estate is entailed. Mrs. Bennet laments the unfairness of the system that entails his property away from his daughters.In a letter, Mr. Collins explains that a disagreement between his late father and Mr. Bennet has troubled him and that since losing his father, he’s desired to “heal the breach” (61). Since being ordained, he’s benefited from the patronage of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and his rectory is located in her parish. Now that he’s a clergyman, it is his “duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence” (61). He apologizes for being in the position of “injuring” Mr. Bennet’s “amiable daughters” and states his “readiness to make them every possible amends” (61). He closes by suggesting he “trespass on your hospitality” (61) the following week, adding that Lady Catherine will not object as long as another clergyman can take his place on Sunday.Elizabeth, who is “chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine,” finds “something very pompous in his style” (63). When she asks if he can be “a sensible man,” Mr. Bennet replies that he has “great hopes of finding him quite the reverse” (63).Mr. Collins arrives and needs no encouragement to talk. He is complimentary of the Bennet girls’ beauty, stating he doesn’t doubt that they will marry well. Mrs. Bennet hopes so, “for else they will be destitute enough” (63). She states he “must confess” that it is “a grievous affair” (63) for her daughters, though she doesn’t find fault with him personally. Mr. Collins assures her that he is “sensible […] of the hardship,” that he has “come prepared to admire them,” and that he will say more on the subject later (63).At dinner, Mr. Collins admires the house and furniture; Mrs. Bennet would be pleased “but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it as his own future property” (64).", "Volume 1, Chapter 14 Summary": "Mr. Bennet brings up the subject of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, correctly assessing that Mr. Collins is eager to discuss her. Mr. Collins praises Lady Catherine, claiming he “ha[s] never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank” (64) and that she has been extraordinarily gracious to him by asking him to dine at Rosings and visiting him “in his humble parsonage” (65), even bestowing on him some advice on how to furnish it.When Mrs. Bennet asks about Lady Catherine’s daughter, Mr. Collins replies that according to Lady Catherine, Miss de Bourgh is even more beautiful than other women “because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth” (65). However, as she has “a sickly constitution” (65), she doesn’t possess many accomplishments. Her kindness is demonstrated in the fact that she “often condescends to drive by my humble abode” (66) in her carriage. Mr. Collins describes how he pays Miss de Bourgh little compliments whenever possible, for compliments “are always acceptable to ladies” (66). These many compliments are well regarded by Lady Catherine, and Mr. Collins feels “peculiarly bound to pay” (66). Mr. Bennet is delighted, for Mr. Collins is “as absurd as he had hoped” (66).After dinner, the family takes to reading. Mr. Collins declares he never reads novels, and after being offered a wide selection of books, he chooses a book of sermons for young women. As he is reading, Lydia chatters to Mrs. Bennet about the officers. Mr. Collins laments that young women so seldom read serious books, even though they are “written solely for their benefit” (67). Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologize for Lydia, and Mr. Collins says he “bore his young cousin no ill-will” (67). Then he and Mr. Bennet begin a game of backgammon.", "Volume 1, Chapter 15 Summary": "Austen writes that “Mr. Collins [is] not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society” (68). Though meeting his requirements at his university, he failed to make connections necessary to advance his career. He obtained the patronage of Lady Catherine due to a “fortunate chance.” His exaggerated deference to Lady Catherine, combined with his “very good opinion of himself,” results in his being “a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility” (68). His “excessively generous” (68) plan to atone for his being entailed the Bennet estate is to marry one of the Bennet daughters, as long as they are as beautiful as he has heard.He poses his plan to Mrs. Bennet. He originally had chosen Jane to take as his wife, but when Mrs. Bennet informs him that Jane will probably soon be engaged, he easily switches to Elizabeth. Mrs. Bennet is delighted that soon, two of her daughters will be married.Lydia and her sisters, save for Mary, decide to walk into Meryton. Mr. Bennet, eager to get rid of Mr. Collins, who ceaselessly talks to him while he’s in his library, suggests he join them. Mr. Collins is happy to put away his book and agrees.On arriving in Meryton, Kitty and Lydia are distracted by the officers, including their friend, Mr. Denny, and his friend, a handsome, charming stranger. Mr. Denny informs the girls that his friend is Mr. Wickham and that he has just “accepted a commission in their corps” (70). The Bennet daughters pass some time talking with him, pleased by his “happy readiness of conversation” (70), until Bingley and Darcy draw close on their horses. Darcy and Wickham exchange a tense, unpleasant look before Wickham touches his hat and leaves, “a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deign[s] to return” (71). Elizabeth can’t help but wonder what it means.They arrive at the house of their aunt, Mrs. Philips. Mr. Collins is profuse in his apologies for his intrusion; Mrs. Philips is impressed with his good breeding. She tells the girls that some officers are dining at their house the next night and that she’ll invite Wickham.They return home. Mr. Collins pleases Mrs. Bennet by telling her that Mrs. Philips is the most “elegant” (72) woman he’s seen in his life, other than Lady Catherine.", "Volume 1, Chapters 11-15 Analysis": "Mr. Collins’s entrance triggers a series of events that determine the course of characters’ lives. He also serves as a useful vehicle through which readers are offered deeper glimpses into characters’ psyches. Mr. Collins’s personality and his interactions provide a better understanding of central characters.Comparing Darcy to Mr. Collins reveals Darcy’s sincerity and depth of character. At Netherfield, Elizabeth teases that Darcy lacks “[f]ollies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies” (55)—that he is without “defect” (55). Darcy contradicts her, insisting he has never claimed to be without defect. He is honest in his self-assessment, stating that his flaw is one of “temper”—he “cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself” (56). When Elizabeth suggests his “defect is a propensity to hate every body” (56), he smiles—and gently informs her that her defect “is willfully [sic] to misunderstand” (56) people. In this passage, Darcy not only speaks with humility and self-awareness, but avoids excessive flattery of Elizabeth. He chooses his words carefully and speaks sparingly, and only when he has something important to say.On the contrary, Mr. Collins’s unctuousness is evident from his first letter to the Bennets, in which he demonstrates overblown self-importance with his verbose descriptions of his position and circumstances. Elizabeth wonders at his excessive “deference” (62) to Lady Catherine, whom Mr. Collins later will praise profusely for deigning to visit him at his “humble parsonage” and for the beauty of her daughter, who is blessed with features of a “young woman of distinguished birth” (65). So engrossed is he in his reverence to his social superior that he fails to recognize Mr. Bennet’s mocking questions, explaining with all seriousness how he relays to Miss de Bourgh the “little elegant compliments” (66) that so please women. His puffed-up effusiveness, as well as his exaggerated praise of the Bennet daughters, of Mrs. Philips, and even of Mrs. Bennet’s furniture—which she suspects he appraises as a future owner—reveal him to be insincere.The ease with which Mr. Collins moves from Jane to Elizabeth—when Mrs. Bennet tells him Jane will likely soon be engaged, Mr. Collins “[has] only to change” (69) from one sister to the other—further distinguishes him from Darcy, who finds himself attracted to Elizabeth for specific qualities that complement his own. While Darcy recognizes and appreciates Elizabeth’s intellect and honesty, Mr. Collins sees her as another body in line to receive his beneficence.Interestingly, Elizabeth comments that while Darcy’s “[i]mplacable resentment” is “a failing, indeed” (56), it is a fault that she “cannot laugh at” (56)—as opposed to Mr. Collins’s “absurd” diatribes, which Mr. Bennet, who’d had “great hopes” of Mr. Collins being “an oddity” (62), observes “with the keenest enjoyment” (66). Elizabeth’s assertion that she hopes Darcy’s inability to be laughed at remains “an uncommon advantage” because she “dearly love[s] a laugh” and reiterates her likeness to her father, who shares her quick wit and skeptical nature (55).Finally, Mr. Collins’s entrance reminds readers that Mrs. Bennet is justified in her fears for her daughters’ futures. Though joking, Mr. Bennet speaks accurately when he declares that after his death, Mr. Collins “may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases” (60). Mr. Bennet frequently demonstrates exasperation for the marriage-obsessed antics of his wife; however, subsequent chapters show the dangerous effects of his lackadaisical approach.", "Volume 1, Chapter 16 Summary": "At dinner, Mr. Collins flatters Mrs. Philips by stating her house reminds him of a small room at Rosings; once she learns what Rosings is, Mrs. Philips eagerly receives the compliment.When Wickham walks in, Elizabeth is reminded how attractive he is. Though he is the object of every woman’s stare, he sits next to Elizabeth. She is curious about how he knows Darcy and is surprised when he says their families have been connected for years. Wickham alludes to their tense meeting the previous day and asks if she knows him well. She responds she knows him “[a]s well as I ever wish to” (75); Wickham says he can’t offer an opinion but that most people are “blinded by his fortune […] or frightened by his high and imposing manners” (76). Elizabeth assures him that everybody in Hertfordshire is “disgusted with his pride” (76). She hopes his plans are not altered by Darcy’s being close by.Wickham says he has no reason to avoid Darcy other than “a sense of very great ill usage” (76). Darcy’s father bequeathed him a career with the church, but Darcy prevented him from obtaining it, leaving him destitute. Elizabeth, shocked, says Darcy “deserves to be publicly disgraced” (78). When Wickham says he will not disgrace him out of deference to Darcy’s father, “Elizabeth honor[s] him for such feelings, and [thinks] him handsomer than ever as he expresse[s] them” (78). Wickham adds that Darcy is jealous of him for his father’s love, explaining that they’d grown up together and that his own father took care of Pemberley when Darcy’s father grew older.Wickham admits that Darcy is “a very kind and careful guardian of his sister” (79), who is also overly proud. Elizabeth wonders how Darcy can be so friendly with “sweet-tempered” Bingley. Wickham responds that Darcy “can please where he chooses” (80).Mr. Collins loses money at cards and proclaims that “happily” Lady Catherine’s patronage means he is “not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object” (80). Wickham informs Elizabeth that Lady Catherine was the sister of Darcy’s mother and that Darcy and his cousin, Miss de Bourgh, are expected to marry. Elizabeth says Lady Catherine sounds “arrogant” and “conceited” (81), and Wickham agrees.On the way home, Elizabeth can’t stop thinking of Wickham but doesn’t have a chance to mention him, as Lydia and Mr. Collins monopolize the conversation.", "Volume 1, Chapter 17 Summary": "Elizabeth tells Jane what she’s learned from Wickham. Jane can’t believe Bingley could be so deceived or that Wickham could have suffered so much, stating that Darcy and Wickham must both have “been deceived” about each other. Elizabeth jokes that Jane is trying to avoid thinking poorly of anyone. Jane insists that Darcy couldn’t possibly have behaved so badly, that Bingley couldn’t be so wrong about him. Elizabeth says Bingley is more likely to be deceived than Wickham is to lie—“there was truth in his looks” (83).Bingley and his sisters arrive to give Jane her invitation to the Netherfield ball. His sisters speak warmly to her and avoid the rest of the family as much as possible before fleeing, to Bingley’s chagrin.Elizabeth is excited to dance with Wickham and to find “a confirmation of every thing in Mr. Darcy’s look and behaviour” (84). She asks Mr. Collins if he intends to go to the ball and is surprised to hear that he not only is going but also intends to dance. She is horrified when he asks her to dance the first two dances with him, for she’d intended those dances for Wickham; she reluctantly accepts, realizing “that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage” (85). The increased attention Mr. Collins pays her and her mother’s sly comments confirm her suspicion.", "Volume 1, Chapter 18 Summary": "Elizabeth is disappointed when Wickham is not at the Netherfield ball. Believing Darcy responsible, she struggles to be civil with him. He surprises her by asking her to dance. Charlotte suggests she may enjoy it; Elizabeth declares that finding “a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate” would be “the greatest misfortune” (88). Charlotte warns her not to let her feelings for Wickham “make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence” (88).While dancing, Elizabeth alludes to her new friendship with Wickham; Darcy says Wickham “is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends” (89) but that he struggles to keep them. When Elizabeth notes that he’s lost Darcy’s friendship, Darcy does not respond. Elizabeth reminds him that he’d told her his “resentment once created was unappeasable” and asks if he is careful not to be “blinded by prejudice” (90), for those whose opinions never change must form correct opinions. She also says she receives “different accounts” of his character. He hopes she won’t judge him “at the present moment” (91) because it would not reflect well on either of them. When the dance is over, they are both upset, though Darcy’s “powerful feeling” (91) toward Elizabeth makes him forgive her. Jane tells Elizabeth that Bingley has confirmed that Wickham is not respectable and that Darcy has been kinder than Wickham deserves. Elizabeth responds that Bingley doesn’t know the whole story.Elizabeth is horrified as Mr. Collins fawns over Darcy, who addresses him with “distant civility” (94) and moves away. She is further mortified when her mother gushes to Lady Lucas about how wonderful it will be when Jane marries Bingley. Noticing Darcy can hear every word, Elizabeth encourages her mother to talk quietly, to no avail. Elizabeth’s sister Mary, a poor singer, performs for the party and refuses to step down. Mr. Collins offers a long speech about the duties of a clergyman and his own opinion of music, amusing Mr. Bennet.When Mr. Collins monopolizes Elizabeth, Charlotte distracts him. The Bennets, by a maneuvering of Mrs. Bennet, are the last to leave, and Bingley’s sisters do not hide their disdain. Mrs. Bennet is pleased that Jane will be living at Netherfield soon. She’s also happy that Elizabeth, the daughter “least dear” (99) to her, will soon marry Mr. Collins.", "Volume 1, Chapters 16-18 Analysis": "First Impressions, the original title of Pride and Prejudice, is an apt descriptor of these chapters. Elizabeth demonstrates level-headedness, perception, and good judgment, and her father describes her as the most sensible of all his daughters. Her association with Mr. Wickham, however, illustrates how she is a victim of her own prejudices.Wickham’s comment to Elizabeth that “Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses” (80) is an appropriate description of Wickham himself. With his good looks and charm, he immediately attracts Elizabeth, who is all too ready to accept his accusations against Darcy. Sitting next to Elizabeth at dinner—a choice that appears deliberate, for he’s aware that she noticed the “cold manner of” (75) his meeting with Darcy the day before—he wastes no time probing for Elizabeth’s opinion of Darcy. When he confirms her opinion, Elizabeth listens eagerly, complimenting him for his grace in handling the injustice he claims to have suffered at Darcy’s hand, thinking “him handsomer than ever” (78). Not at all dubious of Wickham revealing this personal story to a stranger, Elizabeth believes his “countenance may vouch” (78) for his good nature and later tells Jane that “there was truth in his looks” (83). He manipulates her by revealing the story in bits and pieces, occasionally changing the topic of their conversation—letting her “interest of the subject increase” (76), then coming back around to his sorrowful tale and claiming he has “no right to give my opinion” (75). Elizabeth, entranced by her first impression of him, fails to notice any of this.At the Netherfield ball, Elizabeth takes pleasure in finding “confirmation of every thing in Mr. Darcy’s look and behavior [sic]” (84) and even tells Charlotte she is “determined to hate” (88) him. She confronts Darcy about Wickham without asking to hear his side of the story, accusing him of being “blinded by prejudice” (90) and of holding too stubborn an opinion, something of which she herself is guilty. She tells Jane that Bingley, who defends Darcy, must be wrong because “he is unacquainted with several parts of the story” (93)—yet she herself is no more acquainted with the whole story than he is. In this way, Elizabeth demonstrates the very prejudice for which she faults Darcy.Darcy himself, when confronted by Elizabeth, exhibits the tactful discretion Wickham lacks by refraining from insulting Wickham the way Wickham insults him. When Elizabeth notes that Wickham has lost his friendship, Darcy “[makes] no answer, and [seems] desirous of changing the subject” (89). Elizabeth reminds him that he’d once told her that his “resentment once created was unappeasable” (90) and asks him whether he is “very cautious […] as to its being created” (90). Darcy replies simply, “I am” (90). Finally, after Elizabeth explains that she is trying to obtain a picture of his character, he warns her “not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either” (91). Darcy suggests that Elizabeth’s opinion is based on false information without explicitly saying so, thus sparing her embarrassment, avoiding censuring her, and retaining his composure. Just as with Mr. Collins, comparison between Wickham and Darcy leaves Darcy looking more favorable.Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins seek to impress the Bingley party, but their tactlessness and obsequiousness create the opposite effect. Mr. Collins begs Darcy’s pardon in not introducing himself sooner, blithely ignoring Elizabeth’s insistence that he will appear “impertinent” (94). Mrs. Bennet’s loud gushing over Bingley, and the brazen manipulation she employs to ensure they are the last to leave, only annoy Bingley’s sisters. With this unabashed worship of the wealthy, Austen exposes those who prove correct the criticisms of the haughty Bingley sisters.", "Volume 1, Chapter 19 Summary": "Mr. Collins asks Mrs. Bennet if he can speak privately with Elizabeth. She readily agrees, despite Elizabeth’s pleas that she not leave. Once alone, Mr. Collins commends Elizabeth’s modesty. He tells her he has chosen her to be his wife and proceeds to list his reasons for marrying. First, clergymen in “easy circumstances” should “set the example of matrimony in his parish” (101). Second, marriage will make him happy. Finally, Lady Catherine has graciously offered her opinion that he should marry a “useful” woman who was “not brought up high” (102). He assures her that her “wit and vivacity” will be “acceptable” to Lady Catherine “when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite” (102). He notes there is no shortage of women in his neighborhood but that he has chosen to marry one of the Bennets to alleviate their financial burden.Elizabeth interrupts to thank him and decline his proposal. Mr. Collins brushes off this rejection, stating women often decline proposals they intend to accept. Elizabeth promises she is sincere and that she would not jeopardize her happiness by rejecting a man she wanted to marry. She informs him he could never make her happy, nor she him, adding that Lady Catherine would not approve of her either. When Mr. Collins again refuses to accept her rejection, she asserts that he should feel no guilt inheriting the Longbourn estate when the time comes.Elizabeth rises to leave. Mr. Collins says her rejection is “consistent with the true delicacy of the female character” and that he hopes when they speak again, she has “a more favourable [sic] answer” (104). Elizabeth again denies that she is being modest. Mr. Collins claims she couldn’t possibly reject him, as his hand is not “unworthy your acceptance” given his “situation in life” and his “connections with the family of De Bourgh” (104). He warns that her own situation means she may not receive another proposal. Therefore he must conclude that she’s rejecting him in the hopes of “increasing my love by suspense” in the habit “of elegant females” (104).Elizabeth says she “would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere” (104), that she would like to be seen as “a rational creature speaking the truth” (105) rather than “an elegant female intending to plague you” (105). When he again denies her rejection, calling her “uniformly charming” (105), she runs from the room, hoping her father can get through to him.", "Volume 1, Chapter 20 Summary": "After Elizabeth flees the room, Mrs. Bennet congratulates Mr. Collins, who cheerfully tells her what happened and says he has “every reason to be satisfied” because Elizabeth’s rejections “naturally flow from her bashful modesty” (105). Shocked, Mrs. Bennet tells him she doesn’t believe Elizabeth “meant to encourage him” but that she will “be brought to reason” (106). She remarks that Elizabeth is “a very headstrong, foolish girl,” and Mr. Collins replies that if that’s true, she may not be a good wife “to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in a marriage state” (106). Panicking, Mrs. Bennet tells her husband that he must make Elizabeth marry Mr. Collins before he changes his mind. Elizabeth is summoned. Mrs. Bennet tells her she will never see her again if she doesn’t marry Mr. Collins; Mr. Bennet says he will never see her again if she does.Mrs. Bennet pleads with Elizabeth, who continues to refuse. Charlotte Lucas arrives, and Mrs. Bennet wails her sorrows, telling Elizabeth she is “undutiful,” that if she continues rejecting proposals no one will be able to take care of her, and that “nobody is on my side” (108).Alone with Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Collins says that “[r]esignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all” (109) and that he has begun to doubt whether he would have been happy with Elizabeth as his wife. He tells her that “resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation” (109) and that he hopes she does not feel it is disrespectful for him to withdraw his proposal. He concludes with an apology for accepting the rejection from Elizabeth herself rather than allowing her parents to intervene on his behalf.", "Volume 1, Chapter 21 Summary": "Mr. Collins does not avoid Elizabeth; rather, he exhibits his feelings with “stiffness of manner” and “resentful silence” (110). He spends the day speaking with Charlotte Lucas, and Elizabeth is grateful to Charlotte for distracting him. Mrs. Bennet continues to show her anger. Much to Elizabeth’s dismay, Mr. Collins doesn’t shorten his visit.The girls walk to Meryton, where Wickham joins them at Mrs. Philips’s house. Wickham tells Elizabeth that he deliberately stayed away from the Netherfield ball to avoid being in the same room as Darcy, which might have led to a scene. He pays special attention to her as he walks with them back to Longbourn. Elizabeth is happy to be singled out and also to introduce him to her parents.Jane receives an upsetting letter from Miss Bingley. She confides in Elizabeth that Miss Bingley says her brother has been called to London for business, that they’ve decided to follow him there, and that they do not intend to return the entire winter. She hopes Jane will write to her, that she enjoys her Christmas, and that her “beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss” (112). She adds that in London, they will have many opportunities to see Darcy’s sister Georgiana, who has no “equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments” (113); she confesses that she and her sister expect Miss Darcy will marry Bingley and asks if Jane feels it is wrong of her to “hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many” (113).Jane believes Miss Bingley thinks her brother is indifferent toward her and is trying to “most kindly” warn her. Elizabeth believes Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with Jane, prefers for him to marry Miss Darcy, and is trying to keep him and Jane apart. She says that Bingley’s love for Jane is obvious and that their family simply is “not rich enough or grand enough for them” (114). Jane insists Miss Bingley “is incapable of deceiving any one” and that it’s more likely that “she is deceived herself” (114). Elizabeth does not believe Bingley himself does not intend to return, that this is merely “Caroline’s interested wishes” (115).", "Volume 1, Chapter 22 Summary": "Charlotte continues to entertain Mr. Collins when the Bennets have dinner at the Lucas’s house, and Elizabeth expresses her gratitude. She has no idea that Charlotte is attempting to earn Mr. Collins’s affection and that she’s been “tolerably encouraging” (116) toward him.The next day, Mr. Collins sneaks away from Longbourn to propose; having been rejected once, he wants to avoid his cousins knowing of his proposal until it’s accepted. After his profuse speech, Charlotte accepts. He asks her to pick a date when she will “make him the happiest of men” (116-17); having “accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment,” Charlotte “cared not how soon” the wedding would take place (117).Sir William and Lady Lucas eagerly give their consent and are delighted that their daughter is marrying a man who will come into wealth. Lady Lucas wonders how long Mr. Bennet will live. The other Lucas daughters are happy to be able to enter society, and the Lucas sons are pleased they won’t have to support Charlotte in her old age. Charlotte herself accepts the situation with composure. Mr. Collins’s “society is irksome,” and he is “neither sensible nor agreeable” (117); however, “marriage had always been her object,” for though it is “uncertain of giving happiness,” it is “the only honorable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune” (117). As she is already 27 and not beautiful, Charlotte feels fortunate, though she fears the marriage will affect her cherished relationship with Elizabeth. She resolves to inform Elizabeth herself after Mr. Collins has departed Longbourn.Elizabeth is stunned by the news. Charlotte tells her she is “not romantic,” that she asks “only a comfortable home” (120),and that she has no less of a chance of happiness with him than with any other husband. Reflecting later, Elizabeth laments the “humiliating picture” of Charlotte marrying Mr. Collins; she believes her friend is “disgracing herself” by marrying him for “worldly advantage.” Doubting Charlotte will be happy, she feels Charlotte has “sunk in her esteem” (120).", "Volume 1, Chapter 23 Summary": "Sir William visits Longbourn to announce the news. The Bennets are unbelieving; Sir William’s “good-breeding” enables him to tolerate “their impertinence” (121). Elizabeth confirms his story, and she and Jane congratulate him.Mrs. Bennet remains mostly silent until he leaves, at which time she claims she doesn’t believe it, that Mr. Collins has been tricked, that he and Charlotte will never be happy, and that maybe they won’t get married after all. She complains that it’s Elizabeth’s fault and “that she herself [has] been barbarously used by them all” (121). She finds it difficult to speak to Elizabeth or the Lucases. Mr. Bennet is delighted to find that Charlotte, “whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter” (122). As Mr. Collins is a mere clergyman, Kitty and Lydia see the news as gossip and nothing more. Lady Lucas, in “triumph,” comes to Longbourn more frequently than usual to talk about “the comfort of having a daughter well married” (122).Elizabeth’s “disappointment in Charlotte” leads her to believe they will never have the same intimacy again, and she “turn[s] with fonder regard to her sister” (122). Meanwhile, Jane awaits a response from Miss Bingley, to whom she’d written after her last letter. Elizabeth fears that Bingley’s sisters will succeed in keeping him from returning. Jane prefers to hide her feelings and is tormented by Mrs. Bennet, who encourages her to confess “that if he [does] not come back she should think herself very ill used” (124).Mr. Collins returns and is less warmly received; thankfully for the Bennets, he spends most of his time with the Lucases. Mrs. Bennet cannot tolerate the sight of Charlotte, whom “[a]s her successor in that house,” she sees “with jealous abhorrence” (124). Mrs. Bennet believes Charlotte is biding her time until she comes into possession of Longbourn and that whenever she speaks quietly with Mr. Collins, they are discussing their plans “to turn herself and her daughters out of the house” (124).", "Volume 1, Chapters 19-23 Analysis": "Mr. Collins demonstrates a vision of women that is, at best, idealized and, at worst, dehumanizing. He sees women as vapid and delicate, describing how he pleases Miss de Bourgh with “those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies” (66). He scolds Lydia for failing to read sermons on proper women’s behavior. Upon meeting the Bennet daughters, his first observation is that their beauty undoubtedly ensures that they will be “well disposed of in marriage” (63). In choosing a wife, he assesses the Bennet daughters in the same manner he assesses their furniture: as “future property” (64). Most importantly, he insists Elizabeth’s rejections are a sign of her “bashful modesty” (105). This declaration shows how little Mr. Collins understands Elizabeth and, therefore, the way marriage is often conducted as business. Despite her insistence that she “is not one of those young ladies” (103) who keep suitors in suspense, he insists her rejection is “the usual practice of elegant females” (104), a claim that coordinates with his vision of the ideal woman (and, incidentally, prevents him from having to consider that her rejection has something to do with him). This vision is confirmed by his statements to Mrs. Bennet that if Elizabeth is indeed a “headstrong” girl (106), she cannot possibly make him happy. Though Elizabeth begs to be treated as a “rational creature” (105), he refuses to give weight to her thoughts. He assures her that her “wit and vivacity” (102) will be acceptable to his patron “when tempered” (102), and in his desire for a pliant wife, he contrasts once again with Darcy, who is attracted to Elizabeth because of, not in spite of, this vivacity. Mr. Collins’s inability to accept her rejection demonstrates the male-dominated system that leaves women powerless. Though conceited, Mr. Collins isn’t entirely wrong when he states that the Bennets’ modest financial situation means that “it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you” (104). Mr. Collins remains incredulous about Elizabeth’s rejection because his lofty position should attract a woman whose future remains uncertain. He is so certain of his power over her that he calls her rejection “evil” (109). Elizabeth’s intention “to apply to her father,” (105) who, as a man, will be taken more seriously, demonstrates the degree to which women are disenfranchised and disempowered.The fact that Mr. Collins finds so willing a wife in Charlotte Lucas is evidence that the power he esteems himself to hold is not imagined. The Lucases, who can “give little fortune” (117) to Charlotte and whose sons fear they’ll have to take care of her, are delighted by her engagement to Mr. Collins. Charlotte, though believing Mr. Collins “irksome,” feels fortunate for this “preservative from want” (117). By making marriage her “object” (117), she submits to the system and accepts what she feels is the best she can hope for. Elizabeth is disappointed to see her friend “disgracing herself” for “worldly advantage” (120). However, Charlotte has reason to thus assess her choices. Elizabeth’s expectation may be more than what society can give her.Similarly, Mrs. Bennet’s jealousy of Charlotte, and her bitterness toward Charlotte inheriting Longbourn, seems justified by Lady Lucas’s calculating how much longer Mr. Bennet is likely to live. In a system in which women assess their monetary value and settle in unhappy marriages, Mrs. Bennet’s fear and resentment—though histrionic—are understandable. Mrs. Bennet is willing to sacrifice Elizabeth’s happiness for financial security.", "Volume 2, Chapter 1 Summary": "Jane receives a letter from Miss Bingley reiterating their intention to stay in London through the winter and praising Miss Darcy, whom she believes will marry Bingley. With this letter, “[h]ope was over, entirely over” (129). Elizabeth is indignant. She believes Bingley truly loves Jane and that his “easiness of temper” makes him “the slave of his designing friends” (129). She feels he’s entitled to sacrifice his own happiness if he chooses but can’t forgive him for sacrificing her sister’s, too.Mrs. Bennet continues to complain, to the annoyance of Jane and Elizabeth. Jane insists she will be over Bingley soon and that she simply misinterpreted Bingley’s feelings; Elizabeth tells her she is “angelic” and “too good” (130). She goes on to say that “[t]he more I see of the world, the more I am dissatisfied with it” (131) and that “every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters” (131). Jane, sensing Elizabeth is referring to Bingley and Charlotte, pleads with her not to think thoughts that “will ruin [her] happiness” (131) and to remember that people’s circumstances sometimes dictate their behavior. Elizabeth tells Jane that if Charlotte actually loved Mr. Collins, she’d be even more disappointed in her.Jane states that sometimes young men inadvertently hurt women and that women’s vanity makes them see more in a relationship than exists. Elizabeth responds that “[t]houghtlessness” (132) can be just as harmful. When Elizabeth says again that Bingley’s sisters are behind his leaving, Jane argues there’s no reason for them not to put his happiness first. Elizabeth disagrees, saying they would rather he marry a wealthy girl than be happy. Jane tells her that if Bingley really loved her, his sisters wouldn’t be able to part them. She says she is “not ashamed of having been mistaken” (132) and begs Elizabeth to let her see it in “the best light” (133). Elizabeth respects her wishes and says no more about Bingley.Mr. Bennet jokes that being crossed in love is a rite of passage and hopes Elizabeth’s turn comes soon, perhaps with Wickham. Wickham visits frequently, and his presence is a relief to the family. His accusations against Darcy are now common knowledge, and “every body [is] pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter” (134). Darcy is “condemned as the worst of men” (134).", "Volume 2, Chapter 2 Summary": "Mrs. Bennet’s brother and sister-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, visit Longbourn from London. They are “sensible” and “well bred” (134), much loved by the Bennets and particularly by Jane and Elizabeth. Mrs. Bennet laments that she almost had two daughters married; she doesn’t blame Jane but is still frustrated with Elizabeth. Also, she feels “[t]he Lucases are very artful people indeed” (135).Privately, Mrs. Gardiner tells Elizabeth that young men frequently fall in and out of love. Elizabeth responds that in this case, “the interference of friends” (136) hastened his leaving. Mrs. Gardiner suggests that Bingley was not as “violently in love” (136) as they’d thought, though Elizabeth believes she’d never seen “a more promising inclination” (136). Mrs. Gardiner suggests that Jane stay with them for a while, though she worries that Jane will hope to run into Bingley and they “live in so different a part of town” (136). Elizabeth assures her Darcy won’t allow him to visit and that Miss Bingley will probably stop communicating with Jane completely. However, part of her still hopes Bingley will remain in love with Jane and will be able to overcome his sisters’ influence. Jane accepts the Gardiners’ invitation and hopes she’ll be able to see Miss Bingley without running into her brother.Mrs. Gardiner observes Elizabeth and Wickham together during one of the many get-togethers at Longbourn. She doesn’t believe them to be in love but feels “uneasy” about their obvious “preference of each other” (137). She enjoys talking with Wickham about Derbyshire, where she’d spent time as a child and where Pemberley, Darcy’s estate, is located. Because Wickham’s father had served Darcy’s father, Wickham spent much time there, too, and is able to “give her fresher intelligence of her former friends.” When Mrs. Gardiner is told about Darcy’s ill treatment of Wickham, she “trie[s] to remember something of that gentleman’s reputed disposition” (138) as a child to support these claims; finally she feels sure “that she recollects having heard” (138) that he’d been “a very proud, ill-natured boy” (138).", "Volume 2, Chapter 3 Summary": "Mrs. Gardiner tells Elizabeth she is “too sensible […] to fall in love merely because you are warned against it” (139) and that she therefore needs to warn her against a relationship with Wickham. As neither Elizabeth nor Wickham have great fortune, a match between them would be “imprudent.” However, she believes Elizabeth “could not do better” (139) if he had more of a fortune.Elizabeth says she isn’t in love with Wickham but that he is “the most agreeable man I ever saw” (139). Though she does “see the imprudence of it” (139), many young people fall in love despite lack of fortune, and she can’t “promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures” (139). She can promise only “not to be in a hurry” (139). Elizabeth agrees to dissuade Mrs. Bennet from inviting him over, and the conversation ends amicably and with mutual respect.Charlotte and Mr. Collins marry, and before departing for Hunsford, Charlotte says her father and sister are visiting in March and that she’d like Elizabeth to join them. After the wedding, Charlotte and Elizabeth write frequently, but Elizabeth feels that “it [is] for the sake of what had been rather than what [is]” (141). They can no longer be “unreserved,” and their former “intimacy” is gone (141). Charlotte writes “cheerfully” (141) of her home and neighborhood, and Elizabeth feels she’ll know the full situation when she visits.Jane writes to Elizabeth from London, expressing her surprise that she and Miss Bingley have failed to connect; she believes her letter informing Miss Bingley of her being in town must have been lost. Elizabeth doesn’t agree that the letter was lost and fears Bingley will never know Jane is in London. Finally Jane writes that Miss Bingley visited her, that her coldness makes it impossible for Jane to “deceive herself” (142) further, and that only fear of “judging harshly” prevents her from suspecting “duplicity” (143). She also writes that Miss Bingley told her they likely will not ever return to Netherfield. Elizabeth hopes Bingley marries Miss Darcy “as a punishment” (144), for if Wickham is right and Miss Darcy is proud, she will make Bingley unhappy.Mrs. Gardiner writes to Elizabeth to ask about Wickham. Elizabeth responds that he is now “the admirer of someone else” (144) who can offer him £10,000. Elizabeth’s easy acceptance of the situation shows her that she wasn’t in love with him, and she doesn’t blame him or Miss King, the young lady in question.", "Volume 2, Chapter 4 Summary": "January and February pass, and Elizabeth plans to visit Charlotte in March. She is excited to see Charlotte and doesn’t mind leaving her mother and “uncompanionable sisters” (145). Also, they will spend a night in London, which will give her a chance to see Jane. Her only regret is leaving her father, who asks her to write.She and Wickham part amiably; he remembers that she’d been “the first to excite and deserve his attention” and also “the first to listen and to pity” (146). Elizabeth feels that no matter what happens, “he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing” (146).Elizabeth, Sir William, and Maria Lucas arrive at the Gardiners’ house and are warmly greeted. Elizabeth is glad to see Jane looking well. Elizabeth hears from Mrs. Gardiner that Jane suffers “periods of dejection” but that she has “given up the acquaintance” with Miss Bingley (147).Mrs. Gardiner worries that Wickham has become attached to Miss King because of her fortune, especially since Wickham seemed not to pay any attention to her until she inherited the money. Elizabeth asks, “If she does not object to it, why should we?” (147). Mrs. Gardiner replies, “Her not objecting does not justify him” (147). Elizabeth says she is “sick” of young men from Derbyshire and Hertfordshire; Mrs. Gardiner warns her that “that speech savours [sic] strongly of disappointment” (148).Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner ask Elizabeth if she’d like to join them on a tour of the Lakes District in the summer; Elizabeth is overjoyed to accept. She expresses her desire to bid “[a]dieu to disappointment,” asking, “‘What are men to rocks and mountains?’” (148).", "Volume 2, Chapter 5 Summary": "The party arrives at Hunsford. Mr. Collins is as profuse and “ostentatious” (148) as always. Mr. Collins shows them around their home, and Elizabeth has the impression that when he describes the comforts of the house, he is speaking specifically to her. Elizabeth is impressed with Charlotte’s endurance: whenever Mr. Collins says something embarrassing, “Charlotte wisely [does] not hear” (150). Mr. Collins takes them to the garden and explains that he finds great pleasure in gardening. Charlotte says she “encourage[s] it as much as possible” (150).When Mr. Collins and Sir William continue walking in the garden, the women turn back to the house. Charlotte shows them around, and Elizabeth feels that “[w]hen Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout” (151).Mr. Collins tells Elizabeth that she “will have the honour [sic] of seeing” (151) Lady Catherine on Sunday. He says Lady Catherine, who is “all affability and condescension” (151), treats Charlotte very well and that they eat dinner at Rosings twice a week, and that Lady Catherine always lets them ride home in one of her carriages. Charlotte comments that Lady Catherine is “a most attentive neighbor” (151). In her room that night, Elizabeth considers that Charlotte’s “composure in bearing” Mr. Collins is “all done very well” (151).The next day, Maria calls Elizabeth downstairs: Miss de Bourgh and her caretaker are in a carriage outside, and Mr. Collins and Charlotte are talking to them. Elizabeth notes that Miss de Bourgh is “thin and small,” and also “abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind” (152).She thinks Miss de Bourgh, who “looks sickly and cross,” will make Darcy “a very proper wife” (152).When Mr. Collins and Charlotte return inside, Mr. Collins congratulates the women “on their good fortune” (153), for they have been invited to dine at Rosings the following evening.", "Volume 2, Chapter 6 Summary": "The invitation to Rosings is a “triumph” for Mr. Collins, who shows off “the grandeur of his patroness” as well as “her civility towards himself and his wife” (153). He claims that his “knowledge of her affability” (153) led him to expect that they would be invited to tea but not to dinner. Sir William responds that he is not surprised, for his “situation in life” has provided “knowledge of what the manners of the great really are” (153). Mr. Collins spends the day “carefully instructing them in what they [are] to expect” (153) and assures Elizabeth there is no need to make herself “uneasy” over her clothes because Lady Catherine “likes to have the distinction of rank preserved” (154).As they walk to Rosings, Mr. Collins describes how much the windows cost. Maria Lucas is intimidated. Elizabeth has heard nothing of Lady Catherine having “extraordinary talents or virtues” and is not impressed by “mere stateliness of money and rank” (154).Charlotte makes the introductions, thereby avoiding Mr. Collins’s “apologies and thanks” (155). Sir William and Maria are awed silent. Elizabeth finds Lady Catherine’s manners not “such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank” (155). She feels Wickham described her perfectly. Miss de Bough is shockingly frail and says little.During dinner, Mr. Collins is exceedingly proud to sit at the foot of the table. He and Sir William offer Lady Catherine profuse compliments, and Elizabeth wonders if Lady Catherine will find them insincere. However, Lady Catherine seems pleased by the compliments and by the fact that the dishes are “a novelty to them” (156). After dinner, Lady Catherine monopolizes the conversation, “delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as prove[s] that she [is] not used to have her judgment controverted” (156). She tells Charlotte how to handle all her domestic affairs. She also asks Elizabeth personal questions, and Elizabeth answers them, though she “[feels] all the impertinence of her questions” (157). Many of Lady Catherine’s inquiries come with a reminder of her own superior rank and the Bennets’ lesser fortune. She tells Elizabeth that if she had known her mother, she would have encouraged her to hire a governess. When Lady Catherine asks Elizabeth her age, Elizabeth slyly declines to answer, further shocking her.They play cards, and Elizabeth’s table is “superlatively stupid” (159). Lady Catherine, at the other table, draws attention to everyone’s mistakes and talks about herself. Mr. Collins apologizes for winning too much.They return home, and Mr. Collins asks Elizabeth to share her opinion. She exaggerates “for Charlotte’s sake” (160). Mr. Collins, unsatisfied, chimes in with his own praise.", "Volume 2, Chapters 1-6 Analysis": "Elizabeth witnesses sad conclusions for two women she cares about. Her statement to Jane that “[t]he more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it” (131) demonstrates her disillusionment. Disappointed in Charlotte’s settling for Mr. Collins, Elizabeth feels that “all the comfort of intimacy” (141) with her is gone. She also thinks with “anger” about Bingley’s “easiness of temper” (129), which makes him susceptible to his sisters’ influence. Despite her skepticism, Elizabeth has demonstrated a kind of romanticism. What she sees as the failure of sense in those around her gives her an unpleasant look at “the inconsistency of all human characters” (131).However, Elizabeth is also vulnerable to inconsistency and the failure to use “sense” and “good conduct” (139). Mrs. Gardiner is immediately established as a voice of logic, “an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman” (135). Yet Elizabeth does not consider that Mrs. Gardiner’s wariness of Wickham is another sign that his looks are deceiving. When Mrs. Gardiner questions Wickham’s motivation for attaching himself to the newly-wealthy Miss King, Elizabeth defends his mercenary behavior, insisting it’s understandable for “[a] man in distressed circumstances” (147). Her defense of Wickham contrasts with her criticism of Charlotte, who “sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage” (120). She demonstrates similar vulnerability to prejudice in her hope that Bingley’s “punishment” (144) will be to marry Miss Darcy; she thinks Miss Darcy will “make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away” (144), though she doesn’t know her at all.Despite her prejudice in regard to Wickham and Darcy, Elizabeth retains a healthy discernment of Lady Catherine and the blind reverence of wealth demonstrated by Mr. Collins and Sir William, who compete with each other to prove they know more than the other of “the manners of the great” (153). Despite Mr. Collins’s praise, Lady Catherine’s “mere stateliness of money and rank” (154) does not impress Elizabeth. Lady Catherine is arrogant and condescending, with little to commend her. At dinner, she “[does] not supply much conversation” (156); in the drawing room, she monopolizes the conversation with her own opinions and criticisms. The conversation at cards is no better: at Elizabeth’s table, “[s]carcely a syllable [is] uttered that [does] not relate to the game” (159), while Lady Catherine continues her haughty criticism at the next table. Though Mr. Collins considers that his seat “at the bottom of the table” is evidence “that life could furnish nothing greater,” Elizabeth desires more than being allowed into a wealthy woman’s presence (156). She has no trouble answering Lady Catherine’s intrusive personal questions with equal assuredness. She “[can] hardly help smiling” (158) while honestly answering Lady Catherine’s shocked exclamations about the Bennets’ lack of governess. Lady Catherine demonstrates the ill manners she presumes in her visitors. Her daughter’s physical fragility seems to represent Lady Catherine’s fragile ego, which makes her incapable of accepting disagreement of any kind.Like Mr. Bennet, whose joking enables him to tolerate the melodrama of his wife, Charlotte survives her tedious life with Mr. Collins by encouraging him to garden outside as much as possible. Elizabeth’s acknowledgment of Charlotte’s masterful compromises—when she considers Charlotte’s “enjoyment” of her home, she understands that “it [is] all done very well” (151)—suggests her willingness to adjust her thinking when offered new information.", "Volume 2, Chapter 7 Summary": "Sir William stays a week at Hunsford, leaving satisfied that his daughter is well taken care of. Elizabeth and Maria remain with Charlotte. Elizabeth wonders why Charlotte has chosen a small room in the back of the house as a sitting room but realizes the wisdom of the choice when she sees that Mr. Collins would have joined her in the room if it were more pleasant. He prefers to sit in the front of the house, where he has a clear view of the lane; he frequently comes to tell Charlotte when Miss de Bourgh passes in her phaeton.Lady Catherine visits at times and always finds much to criticize in Charlotte’s furniture, housemaid, and food. Mr. Collins tells her when cottagers are arguing or struggling financially, and she calls on them “to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty” (161).They dine at Rosings a couple of times a week. Elizabeth enjoys talking with Charlotte and going for walks. When Charlotte and Mr. Collins visit Lady Catherine, Elizabeth likes to walk along a path that no one else takes.After a couple of weeks, Elizabeth hears that Darcy is expected to arrive at Rosings. She feels his presence will add novelty to their dinners. She is also curious how he will interact with Miss de Bourgh. Lady Catherine is disappointed that Elizabeth and Charlotte already know him, as she won’t be able to introduce him to them herself.When Darcy arrives, Mr. Collins knows immediately, having spent the entire morning watching the road. Mr. Collins visits the following morning and, to everyone’s surprise, returns with Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam, Darcy’s cousin, who is staying with him at Rosings. Charlotte thanks Elizabeth, feeling they wouldn’t have visited had it not been for her presence.Colonel Fitzwilliam is friendly and amiable. Darcy greets them “with his usual reserve” and “every appearance of composure” (163). Colonel Fitzwilliam participates in conversation “with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man” (163); Darcy says little, finally asking Elizabeth about her family’s health. Elizabeth answers him and asks if he has seen Jane, who has been in London for three months, knowing he hasn’t but curious to see his response. He says he has not had the pleasure of seeing her.", "Volume 2, Chapter 8 Summary": "When the Collins party next dines at Rosings, Elizabeth and Colonel Fitzwilliam interact “with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy” (164). Lady Catherine asks what they’re talking about; Colonel Fitzwilliam tells her they’re discussing music. Lady Catherine says she enjoys music more than anyone in England. She asks Darcy if his sister is a good musician; he says she is, and Lady Catherine insists he tell her she must practice. Darcy replies that “she does not need such advice” (165). Lady Catherine goes on to say that she’s told Elizabeth she can practice on her piano any time and that she won’t be a bother in that part of the house. Darcy “look[s] a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill breeding, and [makes] no answer” (165).After dinner, Colonel Fitzwilliam asks Elizabeth to play the piano. Lady Catherine begins speaking to Darcy, who walks away and stands by the piano where Elizabeth can clearly see him. Elizabeth, smiling, says she knows he’s trying to scare her and that her “stubbornness” prevents her from being intimidated. Darcy replies that she doesn’t truly believe he wants to scare her and that he knows she finds “great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact, are not your own” (166). Laughing, Elizabeth says it’s unwise of him to try to “expose my real character,” for she may “retaliate” by saying things that “will shock your relations to hear” (166).Darcy, also smiling, tells her he’s “not afraid” of her, and Colonel Fitzwilliam begs her to elaborate. Elizabeth playfully tells him that at the Meryton ball, Darcy danced only four dances. When Darcy says he didn’t know anyone, Elizabeth jokes that of course “nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room” (167). Darcy says he is “ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers” and can’t speak “easily with those I have not seen before” (167). Elizabeth counters that she isn’t the best piano player, but it’s her own fault because she doesn’t practice. Darcy tells her no one listening could find fault with her playing and that “[w]e neither of us perform to strangers” (167).Lady Catherine interrupts, saying her daughter would have been excellent on the piano had her health allowed it. She criticizes Elizabeth until the carriage takes them home.", "Volume 2, Chapter 9 Summary": "The next day, when Charlotte and Maria are out, Elizabeth is surprised by a visit from Darcy. After exchanging pleasantries, they sit in silence. Out of desperation, Elizabeth says Bingley left Netherfield quickly and that he must be glad Darcy and his sisters joined him. She adds she has heard that Bingley intends never to return; Darcy says he wouldn’t be surprised. Elizabeth says if that’s true, he should give up the house. Darcy suspects he will.They fall into silence again, and Elizabeth says nothing, forcing him to open another conversation. Darcy comments that the house seems comfortable and that Lady Catherine fixed it up for Mr. Collins; Elizabeth says Lady Catherine “could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object” (169). At Darcy’s comment that Mr. Collins “appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife” (169), Elizabeth replies that Charlotte is “one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him” (170).Elizabeth doesn’t believe Charlotte marrying Mr. Collins is “the wisest thing she ever did,” but Charlotte is “perfectly happy” and the marriage is good “in a prudential light” (170).Charlotte and Maria return and are surprised to find Darcy there. After he leaves, Charlotte says Darcy must be in love with Elizabeth. Elizabeth’s description of the awkward silences makes Charlotte change her mind, and they agree he must have had nothing else to do.Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam visit frequently. While it’s clear Colonel Fitzwilliam comes because he enjoys their company, nobody knows why Darcy visits, for he rarely speaks, and when he does, “it seem[s] the effect of necessity rather than of choice” (171).Charlotte believes Darcy has feelings for Elizabeth, but Elizabeth laughs at her suggestion. Charlotte says no more about it because she doesn’t want to disappoint her if it isn’t true. However, she believes Elizabeth’s “dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power” (172). Sometimes she imagines Elizabeth marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam, who is friendlier; however, Darcy is by far the wealthier, more powerful man.", "Volume 2, Chapters 7-11,  Volume 2, Chapter 10 Summary": "Elizabeth frequently meets Darcy on her walks in the park. In order to avoid this awkwardness, she tells him it’s her favorite place to walk and finds it “very odd” that it continues to happen. She wonders if it’s “willful ill-nature” or “voluntary penance” (173) that makes him walk with her. Though much of their time together is spent in silence, he asks her questions and, at one point, seems to suggest that next time she is in Kent, she will stay at Rosings. Elizabeth wonders if he expects her to marry Colonel Fitzwilliam.One day she encounters Colonel Fitzwilliam on her walk. After a brief discussion in which he tells her he and Darcy are leaving Saturday, Colonel Fitzwilliam mentions that he and Darcy share custody of Miss Darcy. Elizabeth asks if Miss Darcy gives them “much trouble,” for if she’s anything like her brother, “she may like to have her own way” (175). At Colonel Fitzwilliam’s puzzled look, Elizabeth assures him she’s never heard anything negative about Miss Darcy, who is well-liked by Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst.Colonel Fitzwilliam reveals that Darcy told him that he recently “saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage” (175-76) and that he took the friend to be Bingley. Elizabeth asks the reason; Colonel Fitzwilliam replies that “there were some very strong objections against the lady” (176). Elizabeth, furious, asks “what right Mr. Darcy [has] to decide on the propriety of his friend’s inclination” (176) but then calms herself and changes the subject.Back in her room, she can think of nothing but the fact that Darcy has caused “all that Jane had suffered, and still continue[s] to suffer” (177), that he dashed the hopes of “the most affectionate, generous heart in the world” (177). She believes Darcy could have no objections to Jane and concludes that he was motivated partly by her family’s circumstances and partly by his desire for his sister to marry Bingley. Her crying brings on a headache, and she doesn’t join the Collinses at Rosings.", "Volume 2, Chapter 11 Summary": "Elizabeth rereads Jane’s letters. Finding Jane’s tone tinged with disappointment, she is glad Darcy is leaving Rosings the day after next and that she’ll soon be with Jane.Her thoughts are interrupted by a visit from Darcy, who tells her that despite his efforts, his “feelings will not be repressed” (179). He states, “You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you” (179). Stunned, Elizabeth listens as he talks of “the family obstacles” with just as much “warmth” as he talks of his love for her (179). He laments her “inferiority” and how being in love with her is “a degradation” (179). Elizabeth can’t help but feel flattered by his affection and would have felt “sorry for the pain he was to receive” (179); however, her sympathy vanishes as he talks of his love growing “in spite of all his endeavours [sic]” (179). She is even more indignant when she sees he has no doubt she will accept his marriage proposal.Elizabeth tells him she has “never desired your good opinion,” which he has clearly related “most unwillingly,” and that she expects that his reservations about her family will help dissipate the pain of rejection (180). With “forced calmness,” Darcy demands to know why he is rejected without even an “endeavour [sic] at civility” (180).Elizabeth responds that he was uncivil by telling her he has tried not to love her and that she could never be with the man who ruined her sister’s happiness. She is angered when Darcy seems “wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse” (181) and admits he did “every thing in my power” (181) to keep Jane and Bingley apart. When Elizabeth chastises him for his treatment of Wickham, Darcy expresses outrage that this is her opinion of him. He suggests that perhaps if he hadn’t wounded her pride—if he had “flattered” her by telling her his feelings were “unqualified”—she would have “suppressed” these “bitter accusations.” He tells her dishonesty is his “abhorrence” and that his concerns about her inferior “connections” are natural (182).Furious, Elizabeth assures him his presentation prevented her only from feeling guilty for hurting him, that from their first meeting she believed him selfish and insensitive. Darcy replies that he “perfectly comprehend[s]” and that he is “ashamed” of his feelings (183). After he leaves, Elizabeth cries for a half hour, then rushes to her room when the Collinses return.", "Volume 2, Chapters 7-11 Analysis": "These chapters contain the climax of Pride and Prejudice, the moment of highest tension and emotion, which leads to the falling action and the resolution of the conflict. This moment comes when Darcy confesses his love for Elizabeth and Elizabeth, in turn, reveals all the reasons for her resentment of him. This scene also reiterates that Elizabeth, who accuses Darcy of pride and prejudice, is not guiltless herself.Elizabeth has been so prejudiced against Darcy that she has failed to notice the obvious signs of his love—and that they have many similarities. She’s surprised when Darcy, who at the Netherfield ball barely tolerated Mr. Collins, returns with Mr. Collins to Hunsford. She marvels when she continues to meet Darcy on her walks, considering every reason except the reality, that he’s going out of his way to meet her. At Rosings, they playfully tease each other, exchanging intelligent, sometimes ironic banter, and slyly smiling at each other as they do. These conversations are in direct contrast with the conversations Elizabeth is accustomed to at Rosings and provide the intellectual stimulation for which she yearns. During one conversation, Darcy remarks, “We neither of us perform to strangers” (167)—a shrewd observation that casts the two of them almost as part of a team.Though Darcy undoubtedly has proven himself proud, a picture of a man who is perhaps not so much rude as socially inept emerges. When Elizabeth playfully chides him for not speaking to anyone at the Meryton ball, Darcy responds that he had not had “at that time the honour [sic] of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party” and that he is “ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers” (167). He proves this true in the days to come when he visits Hunsford frequently but baffles the household by sitting in silence, only occasionally engaging in awkward conversation. Elizabeth does not consider that he’s taken her criticism seriously, that he’s put himself in uneasy situations, all for her sake. The fact that his conversation flows so freely with Elizabeth is a sign of his comfort with her.The proposal scene is significant because Darcy and Elizabeth clearly demonstrate the pride and prejudice that have led them to this point. Darcy speaks as much of the “degradation” of “her inferiority” (179) as he does of his love for her. He has “no doubt of a favourable [sic] answer” (180) and is surprised when she rejects him, thus demonstrating the pride she’s accused him of since the beginning. Elizabeth, already inclined to think the worst of him, chastises him for causing Wickham’s destitution. She openly admits to her prejudice, telling Darcy that “from the first moment […] of my acquaintance with you,” she’d felt he was “the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry” (183). She accuses him of the prejudice she herself exhibits—whereas proud Darcy suggests she might have responded to his proposal differently had he not wounded her pride.Though Darcy’s shock at being rejected is reminiscent of Lady Catherine, who is unused to disagreement and is “quite astonished” (159) by Elizabeth’s honesty, he frequently distinguishes himself from his proud aunt. When Lady Catherine requests that he tell his sister to practice the piano, Darcy responds “that she does not need such advice” (165). When Lady Catherine instructs Elizabeth to practice, Darcy “look[s] a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill breeding” (165). When Lady Catherine speaks to Darcy in the middle of Elizabeth’s song, Darcy moves away from her and positions himself “so as to command a full view” (165-66) of Elizabeth. His refusal to humor Lady Catherine when he deems her behavior inappropriate confirms his penchant for honesty and suggests that while pride prevents him from revealing his feelings sooner, his motives are not as selfish as Elizabeth thinks.", "Volume 2, Chapter 12 Summary": "The next morning, Elizabeth goes for a walk and encounters Darcy, who hands her a letter and walks away. She opens the letter and reads it where she stands.Darcy begins by assuring her he doesn’t intend to propose again. He apologizes for requiring her time, adding that he knows she “will bestow it unwillingly” but that he “demand[s] it of your justice” (185).He writes that, like everyone else, he’d noticed Bingley was in love with Jane. After hearing a marriage was imminent, he observed them carefully. While Jane was “open, cheerful, and engaging” (186), she didn’t seem especially interested in Bingley. If Elizabeth disagrees, he writes, he “must have been in error” (186). He admits to hoping they wouldn’t marry but insists he did not make decisions based on his hopes. Her family’s lack of connection was less a concern than their “total want of propriety” (187). He apologizes for offending her and compliments her and Jane for “conducting yourselves so as to avoid any share of the censure” (187).Bingley had been planning to return to Netherfield, but Darcy and Bingley’s sisters convinced him to stay in London. Darcy’s concerns regarding Jane’s family wouldn’t have convinced Bingley to end the relationship had not it been for his more important suggestion that she didn’t reciprocate Bingley’s feelings. Darcy’s only regret is that he hid Jane’s presence in London from Bingley. He apologizes for hurting Jane but not for doing what he thought was right.Darcy begins his discussion of Wickham by stating that “Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man” (188) who was in charge of the Pemberley estates. Darcy’s father gave Wickham an education and intended to provide him a career in the church. Darcy, unlike his father, noticed “want of principle” (189) in Wickham.In his will, Darcy’s father requested that Darcy ensure Wickham receive his living. When Wickham declined the living in the church and asked that he be paid a sum of money instead, Darcy conceded, knowing Wickham “ought not to be a clergyman” (189). After three years living “a life of idleness and dissipation” (190), Wickham approached Darcy to request the church living. Darcy refused.He heard nothing from Wickham until last summer, when Wickham attempted to elope with Darcy’s 15-year-old sister, who believed herself in love; however, Darcy discovered them first. Darcy believes Wickham’s actions were motivated by his desire for revenge, as well as his sister’s fortune.Darcy hopes Elizabeth will “acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham” (191). He says Colonel Fitzwilliam can verify everything he’s written and that if “your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless” (191), she at least should believe his cousin.", "Volume 2, Chapter 13 Summary": "Elizabeth, “[w]ith a strong prejudice against everything he might say” (192), reads the letter with so much interest she can barely absorb each sentence. She dismisses the claim that he did not know Jane was in love with Bingley and is offended by his assessment of her family. When she reads about what transpired between Darcy and Wickham, she is so shocked she dismisses Darcy’s account of these events as false. However, reading the letter again, she slowly realizes that it’s possible Darcy is blameless.She thinks about how no one had heard of Wickham before he came to Meryton. Though his appearance and charm “had established him at once in the possession of every virtue,” she cannot think of any “instance of goodness” that might prove Darcy’s accusations unfounded (194). She recalls her conversation with Wickham at Mrs. Philips’s house and realizes how inappropriate it was for him to tell such a story to a stranger. Though he’d claimed not to fear Darcy, he’d “avoided the Netherfield ball that very week” (195). She now looks at his attachment to Miss King as “solely and hatefully mercenary” (195).As Elizabeth remembers all this, “[e]very lingering struggle” to redeem Wickham “[grows] fainter” (195). Of Darcy, she admits that, “proud and repulsive as were his manners,” she had never “seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust” (195). Had Wickham’s accusations about Darcy been true, the truth would have been widely known, and “such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley” (196) would not have been so friendly with him.She is “ashamed of herself” for having been “blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd” despite having “always prided [her]self on [her] discernment” (196). It is a “humiliating” but “just” realization (196). She states that “[t]ill this moment, [she] never knew [her]self” (196).Darcy’s explanation of his intervention in Bingley and Jane’s relationship now appears very different. Elizabeth believes if Darcy was so reasonable in one case, he’s likely to be reasonable in another, and she remembers Charlotte’s warning that Jane didn’t demonstrate enough affection. Darcy’s comments about her family are true, and Elizabeth is “depressed beyond any thing she [has] ever known before” (197) to consider that her own family had caused Jane’s heartbreak.", "Volume 2, Chapter 14 Summary": "Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam leave Rosings. Lady Catherine requests the entire Collins party go to Rosings for dinner because she is so sad for their absence. She says that “‘nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do’” (198),and that her nephews were sad to leave, too. Elizabeth smiles when she thinks that under different circumstances, she “might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece” (198) and wonders what Lady Catherine’s reaction would have been.Lady Catherine notices that Elizabeth doesn’t seem herself and suggests that if she’s also sad to leave soon, she should ask her mother if she can stay longer because “there can be no occasion for your going so soon” (199). When Elizabeth says she must return home, Lady Catherine insists she and Maria have a servant accompany them, as “[i]t is highly improper” (199) for them to go themselves. Elizabeth says her uncle is sending someone to go with them.In the following days, Elizabeth walks alone as much as she is able, so she can “indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections” (200); these walks are her “greatest relief” (200). She learns Darcy’s letter by heart. When she thinks of how “she had condemned and upbraided him” (200), she feels sympathy for him and gratitude for his affection. She regrets how she’s acted and is ashamed of “the unhappy defects of her family” (200). Her father refuses to “restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters” (200), choosing to laugh at them, instead; her mother not only refuses to “check the imprudence” (201) of Kitty and Lydia but encourages it, thus ensuring it will never change. Most troubling to her is that Bingley’s affection was sincere and that Jane has suffered disappointment through no fault of Bingley himself but because of her family.Elizabeth dines at Rosings with the Collinses on her final night. Lady Catherine tells Elizabeth and Maria how to pack; back at Hunsford, Maria unpacks and repacks her bag.", "Volume 2, Chapter 15 Summary": "On the morning of Elizabeth’s departure, Mr. Collins finds her alone and offers heartfelt thanks for visiting their “humble abode,” which may seem “extremely dull to a young lady like yourself” (202). He knows Charlotte appreciates it, and they are “grateful for the condescension” (202). Elizabeth tells him she enjoyed her visit and that she herself is grateful. Mr. Collins expresses his happiness at her happiness and says he feels fortunate that it was “in our power to introduce you to very superior society” (202). He hopes she will offer a positive report to those in Hertfordshire, having seen “Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins” (203). He also hopes “it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate” (203) and that Elizabeth herself finds “equal felicity in marriage” (203). Elizabeth tells him “with equal sincerity […] that she firmly believe[s] and rejoice[s] in his domestic comforts” (203).Charlotte enters the room, and Elizabeth is sorry to leave her “to such society” (203); however, she knows Charlotte “had chosen it with her eyes open” (203), that she “[does] not seem to ask for compassion” (203), and that she takes pleasure in her home.After Mr. Collins assures Elizabeth and Maria that he will pass their gratitude along to Rosings, the two women leave and, a few hours later, arrive at Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s house. Elizabeth conceals her news from Jane with effort. She decides to wait until they return to Longbourn, for she isn’t sure how much to reveal and is worried that telling what she knows of Bingley’s feelings “might only grieve her sister further” (204).", "Volume 2, Chapters 12-15 Analysis": "The intimacy of Darcy’s letter enables us to understand not just Darcy’s motivations but also his vulnerabilities and beliefs. For Elizabeth, the letter serves as a catalyst toward self-awareness. She sees her own vulnerabilities for the very first time, ultimately leading her to state that “[t]ill this moment, I never knew myself” (196).In the opening of his letter, Darcy states that he wouldn’t prevail on her to read his letter—or on himself to write it—except that his “character require[s] it” (185). However, he does not intend to propose to her again, thinking the previous day’s scene best forgotten entirely. Unlike Mr. Collins, who refuses to accept Elizabeth’s rejection, Darcy does so immediately; his only concern is clearing his name. His letter is, at times, tinged with pain, showing signs that behind Darcy’s reservation lay deep feelings. For example, he suggests he’s aware that Mr. Wickham has been “violent in his abuse of me to others” (190). Similarly, with strong language and emphasis, he writes that if Elizabeth’s “abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless” (191), she can hear confirmation of his story from Colonel Fitzwilliam.Darcy demonstrates rationality and keen perception by “attentively” (186) watching Jane and Bingley’s behavior, coming to a conclusion of what he believes to be “impartial conviction” (187). There is humility in his acknowledgment that he “must have been in error” in regards to Jane’s feelings, deferring to Elizabeth’s “superior knowledge” (186). He apologizes for causing Elizabeth pain—for example, when describing her family’s “want of propriety” (187) and when disillusioning her about Wickham—and excuses her for being unaware of Wickham’s true nature, stating that “[d]etection could not be in your power” (191). He demonstrates honesty and maturity in expressing regret for keeping from Bingley the knowledge that Jane was in London but holding “it was done for the best” (188). As he does at the Netherfield ball, Darcy also exercises restraint by not insulting Wickham the way Wickham insults him; he relates the events, but no more. Notably absent from his letter is apology for, or even mention of, his haughtiness at the Meryton ball—shown when he tells Bingley, within earshot of Elizabeth, that she is “not handsome enough to tempt me” (13).Elizabeth begins her reading of the letter “[w]ith a strong prejudice against every thing he might say” (192) and ends her rumination seeing the flaws in her opinions. She realizes “she had never felt a wish of enquiring” about Wickham’s “real character,” trusting that his attractive “countenance, voice, and manner” said enough about him, despite her never seeing in him any “trait of integrity or benevolence” (194).The language Austen employs to describe Elizabeth’s deliberation is that of reason and careful measurement: she “examine[s] the meaning of every sentence,” “weigh[s] every circumstance,” and “deliberate[s] on the probability of each statement” (193), putting down and picking up the letter until “[e]very lingering struggle in [Wickham’s] favour [sic][grows] fainter” (195). Though she tries to defend Wickham, the facts speak plainly in favor of Darcy, and in parsing out his letter, she comes to realizations about herself, feeling that the “discovery” of her prejudice and hypocrisy is “humiliating” but “just” (196). Her willingness to undergo this painful transformation—to feel “ashamed of herself” (196) and to acknowledge her flaws—redeems her: in owning her lack of the “discernment” (196) on which she prides herself, she in fact demonstrates that very discernment.", "Volume 2, Chapter 16 Summary": "When Elizabeth, Jane, and Maria reach the inn where Mr. Bennet’s coach is meeting them, Lydia and Kitty are there. Lydia has ordered a table of food and says she wants to treat them, but they have to lend her the money because she spent hers on a hat across the street. The hat is ugly, she says, but “I thought I might as well buy it as not” (205). She adds that it won’t matter what they look like now that the soldiers are leaving Meryton; Elizabeth expresses surprise at this news. Lydia says they are going to Brighton and that she wants her father to take them all. Their mother is in favor of the idea.As they sit down to lunch, Lydia informs them that “Wickham is safe” from Mary King, “a nasty little freckled thing,” for she is going to stay with her uncle in Liverpool (206). Elizabeth thinks Mary King is now safe from Wickham and wonders at the fact that she used to be interested in him.Lydia monopolizes the conversation on the ride home. She asks what Jane and Elizabeth did while they were away and launches into a long speech about how she hopes they met “pleasant men.” She calls Jane an “old maid” for being almost 23 and unmarried, and says she herself would be “ashamed” (207).The Lucases come to Longbourn to meet Maria. They sit around the table, Lydia telling them of the adventures they had that morning. Later, Lydia wants to walk to Meryton, but Elizabeth does not want people to say that “the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers” (209). Elizabeth is happy the soldiers are leaving soon. Her parents frequently discuss the possibility of a trip to Brighton.", "Volume 2, Chapter 17 Summary": "Elizabeth confides in Jane about Darcy’s proposal but leaves out the parts about Bingley’s feelings. Jane feels that “admiration of Elizabeth” (209-10) is “perfectly natural” (210). Jane regrets that Darcy’s presentation was poorly-suited to inspiring Elizabeth to accept, and though she acknowledges that he shouldn’t have assumed he’d be accepted, she also is sorry for his pain.When Elizabeth tells her about what she learned of Wickham, Jane is stunned, as she “would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much sickness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual” (210). She tries to “clear one, without involving the other” (210), but Elizabeth tells her she’ll never “be able to make both of them good for any thing” (210) and that she “must be satisfied with only one” (210). She adds that she feels sorry for Darcy but that Jane feels sorry enough for them both.Jane expresses shock that Wickham has “such an openness and gentleness in his manner” (211). Elizabeth says one man “has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it” (211). Jane never thought Darcy was “so deficient in appearance” (211); Elizabeth says she thought she was “uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him” because “to have a dislike of that kind” is “such an opening for wit” (211). They discuss whether Elizabeth should reveal to the town what Wickham has done and determine that she should not: Elizabeth says Darcy hasn’t authorized it and that Wickham will soon be gone, and Jane says he’s probably sorry for it anyway.In the days that follow, Elizabeth sees that Jane still pines for Bingley. Mrs. Bennet “shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill,” and her “comfort is” that “Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done” (213). Mrs. Bennet sneers that the Collinses will never hurt for money, that they surely talk about having Longbourn, and that she herself would be “ashamed” to have an estate “that was only entailed on me” (214).", "Volume 2, Chapter 18 Summary": "The last week of the soldiers’ stay in Meryton, Lydia and Kitty are distraught. Mrs. Bennet sympathizes, for she experienced a similar disappointment when she was a girl. They complain constantly, and Elizabeth “[feels] anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s objections” (215).Colonel and Mrs. Forster, the militia regiment leader and his wife, invite Lydia to go with them to Brighton. Ecstatic, she flaunts her invitation regardless of Kitty’s feelings. Elizabeth feels it will be the “death-warrant of all possibility of common sense” (216) for Lydia and begs her father to forbid it. She reminds him of Lydia’s “improprieties” and says she will be “yet more imprudent” in Brighton (216). Mr. Bennet responds that Lydia won’t cease her behavior until she’s embarrassed herself and that “we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances” (216). Elizabeth warns that if he doesn’t stop Lydia now, “she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment” (216). She adds that Kitty is easily influenced by Lydia. Mr. Bennet fears there will be “no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton” (217). He assures her that Colonel Forster will prevent Lydia from getting into trouble and that she is too poor “to be an object of prey to any body” (217).Meanwhile, Lydia sees herself as “the object of attention to tens and to scores” (217) of officers, “flirting with at least six officers at once” (218).Wickham has begun paying Elizabeth attention again; Elizabeth resents being “the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry” (218). On his last day in Meryton, he asks her about her time away, and she mentions she’s seen Darcy, who “improves on acquaintance” (219). Flustered, Wickham asks if Darcy has “improved in essentials” (219). Elizabeth responds that “[i]n essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was” (219). She clarifies that she means not that he himself has improved “but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood” (219). Wickham says he’s glad Darcy is now able to appear amiable and that he hopes pride will prevent Darcy from hurting others the way he’s hurt him. Their interactions are tense until they finally part.Lydia stays with the Forsters so she can go to Brighton with them the next day. Mrs. Bennet tells her to have a good time, “advice which there [is] every reason to believe [will] be attended to” (220).", "Volume 2, Chapter 19 Summary": "Mr. Bennet, “captivated by youth and beauty […] had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affect for her” (221). However, he acknowledges that this “disappointment” had been “brought on” by “his own imprudence” and takes comfort in his books, and also in finding “amusement” in “her ignorance and folly” (221). Though not ideal, he “derive[s] benefit” from the situation where he can (221). Elizabeth has always seen her father’s weaknesses but dismissed them because he’s so kind to her. However, she now notices “the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage” (221).Mrs. Bennet and Kitty constantly complain of boredom. Lydia does not write often, and her short letters focus on visits to the officers and her new parasols or gowns. Soon, Kitty can “enter Meryton without tears” (223), making Elizabeth hope that she’ll be “tolerably reasonable” (223) by Christmas. She looks forward to her upcoming trip to the Lakes with the Gardiners.Shortly before she is to leave for the tour, Elizabeth learns Mr. Gardiner needs to postpone the trip a couple of weeks and has to be back sooner than expected; therefore, they won’t have time to go all the way to the Lakes. Instead, they settle on Derbyshire, where Mrs. Gardiner has personal attachments. Elizabeth is disappointed, but as it is “her temper to be happy” (224), she accepts the change of plans. She thinks of how Pemberley is in Derbyshire and hopes she won’t run into Darcy.Finally they depart for their trip. Elizabeth and the Gardiners sincerely enjoy one another’s company. They stay in Lambton, where Mrs. Gardiner has acquaintances. Pemberley is merely five miles away; Mrs. Gardiner asks if Elizabeth would like to see the place she’s heard so much about. Elizabeth, terrified of meeting Darcy, tries to decline; she considers confessing the truth but decides against it. She tactfully asks a chambermaid if the family is at Pemberley; at hearing they are not, Elizabeth is “at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself” (225).", "Volume 2, Chapters 16-19 Analysis": "The seriousness of Elizabeth’s time at Hunsford is contrasted with the frivolousness she witnesses back home. Lydia, within minutes of seeing Jane and Elizabeth, embarks on a long discourse on the officers and on her new hat. Her petty fixations seem even more tedious compared with Elizabeth’s letter from Darcy and the grave decisions she’s recently been forced to make. Even more frustrating is that Lydia is proud of her behavior, shamelessly regaling her family with tales of their puerile games and begging her father to take them to Brighton. She is selfish and insensitive in flaunting her invitation to Brighton in front of Kitty, and once she’s there, her letters show her to be as vacuous as she was at home.In these chapters, a deeper, more nuanced vision of Mr. Bennet appears, in which his humor and sarcasm, while at first endearing, reflect a failure to protect his family. Though at first blinded by his wife’s youthful beauty, Mr. Bennet soon understood her “ignorance and folly” and took what “amusement” he could from her (221). He also retreats into books and into his library to escape from “folly and conceit” (69). He prioritizes peace above all else, failing to step in when his family needs his guidance. Mr. Bennet ignores Elizabeth’s warnings that Lydia’s going to Brighton will solidify her as “the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous” and tells her they will “have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton” (217) and that if she is going to embarrass herself, she might as well do it far from the family. He turns a blind eye to his wife’s and daughters’ behavior, ignoring the dangers right in front of him. Indeed, immediately following his show of unconcern, Lydia imagines “the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers” and that she will be “the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown” (217). All of the slowly-building events leading up to this point—Lydia’s unchecked behavior, Mrs. Bennet’s indulgence, Mr. Bennet’s consistent laxity, and Darcy’s comments—begin to intertwine and will come to a head before the novel’s end.Meanwhile, Elizabeth meets Wickham in a very different state of mind than she has before. Notably, she teases him about Darcy the way she has teased Darcy about Wickham. At the Netherfield ball, she prods Darcy without a direct accusation, mentioning they’d made “a new acquaintance” (89) and nonchalantly questioning him about prejudice. Similarly, she calmly informs Wickham that she saw Darcy at Rosings and that he “improves on acquaintance” (219). When Wickham says he hopes Darcy has “improved in essentials” (219), Elizabeth responds that when it comes to essentials, “he is very much what he ever was” (219)—a subtle statement full of double meaning that does not escape Wickham. By hinting to Wickham that Darcy is the same in character as he always was—that is, honest and full of integrity, not malicious as Wickham has suggested—Elizabeth ensures that Wickham knows she’s aware of the truth and perhaps warns him to refrain from lying about Darcy again. Wickham’s awkwardness with her for the rest of the evening shows that her words have found their mark.", "Volume 3, Chapter 1 Summary": "Pemberley is a handsome stone house surrounded by natural beauty with “no artificial appearance” (229), and Elizabeth is impressed. The housekeeper, Mrs. Reynolds, gives them a tour. The rooms are elegant, not “gaudy nor uselessly fine” (229) like Rosings’s rooms. Elizabeth considers that she could have been mistress there; she finds consolation in the thought that she wouldn’t be allowed to invite the Gardiners.Mrs. Reynolds speaks highly of Darcy, saying she “has never had a cross word from him in my life” and that he is the best master, is generous with the poor, and was “the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world” (232). She also describes Darcy’s generosity toward his sister. Elizabeth ponders the significance of his servants’ praise. With “many people’s happiness […] in his guardianship,” it is “in his power to bestow” much “pleasure or pain” (234).As they walk the grounds, they encounter Darcy. Elizabeth and Darcy blush and engage in awkward conversation. The Gardiners admire him; Elizabeth is “overpowered by shame and vexation” (235). She wonders at his ability to speak civilly to her and to ask after her family; she has never seen “such gentleness” in him. She wonders what he thinks of her, “whether, in defiance of every thing, she [is] still dear to him” (236).Darcy asks “if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends” (238). When she tells him they’re family, she expects him not to talk with them anymore; however, he walks with them and strikes up a conversation with Mr. Gardiner. She’s pleased that Darcy “should know she had she relations for whom there [is] no need to blush” (238). When Darcy learns her uncle loves to fish, he invites him to fish at Pemberley. She asks herself why he has changed, thinking he couldn’t possibly still love her. Darcy says the Bingleys and his sister will join him the next day; his sister wants to meet Elizabeth, and he asks if he may introduce them. Elizabeth feels this is “a compliment of the highest kind” (240).They reach the carriage and decline Darcy’s invitation to go inside the house. After driving off, the Gardiners ask Elizabeth why she’d told them he was “so disagreeable.” Elizabeth tells them “she [has] never seen him so pleasant as this morning” (241). Mrs. Gardiner says it’s hard to believe he treated Wickham so poorly. Elizabeth suggests the situation isn’t what it seemed and that Darcy’s “character [is] by no means so faulty, nor Wickham’s so amiable” (241).", "Volume 3, Chapter 2 Summary": "When Darcy brings his sister to the inn to meet Elizabeth, the Gardiners believe he must be in love with her. Elizabeth is “quite amazed at her own discomposure” (243). She worries that Darcy had “said too much in her favour [sic]” (243) and that she will not impress Miss Darcy.Elizabeth is surprised to find that Miss Darcy is not proud but shy. She finds “good-humour [sic] in her face” (243) and gentleness in her behavior. Bingley arrives, and Elizabeth can’t be angry in the face of his “unaffected cordiality.” Elizabeth is worried about pleasing her guests, but all three are “prepossessed in her favour [sic]” (244): “Bingley [is] ready, Georgiana [is] eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased” (244).Elizabeth sees nothing in Bingley and Miss Darcy’s interactions to suggest they’re in love with each other. She senses him leading the conversation around to Jane and hears tenderness in his voice as he asks about her. On the rare occasion Elizabeth glances at Darcy, she finds him looking content; she also notices that his tone, like the day before, is gentle. She’s impressed with his desire to please “the very relations whom he had openly disdained” (245); she has never “seen him […] so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours [sic]” (245).Before leaving, Darcy invites the Gardiners and Elizabeth to dinner at Pemberley. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner like Darcy; they also think less of Wickham, having heard from townspeople that he’d left with many debts, which Darcy had settled.Elizabeth lies in bed, deciphering her softening feelings for Darcy. She is “ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him” and feels “gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him” (247). Though she’d expected him to avoid her, he seems “eager to preserve the acquaintance” (248). She appreciates his kindness toward her aunt and uncle and acknowledges the “change in a man of so much pride” (248). She has “interest in his welfare” and tries to determine “how far she [wishes] that welfare to depend upon herself” (248).Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth decide to visit Miss Darcy at Pemberley the next morning, while Mr. Gardiner and Darcy fish.", "Volume 3, Chapter 3 Summary": "Elizabeth wonders how she will be received by Miss Bingley, whose “dislike of her,” (249) she is convinced, “had originated in jealousy” (249). Miss Darcy receives Elizabeth and Mrs. Gardiner with “shyness and fear of doing wrong” (249). Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley greet them coolly. Though Bingley’s sisters sit silently, Elizabeth, Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Darcy’s attendant, Mrs. Annesley, engage in conversation. Miss Darcy appears to want to participate and does so as quietly as possible. Elizabeth notices Miss Bingley is watching her and both “[wishes]” and “[fears]” (250) Darcy will enter the room soon. When Darcy and the other men return from fishing, Miss Darcy is more likely to talk.Miss Bingley, who’s been watching Darcy make efforts to ensure Elizabeth and Miss Darcy get to know each other, asks Elizabeth if the officers have left Meryton, noting that their leaving “must be a great loss to your family” (251). Elizabeth is startled but answers casually, then notices Darcy blushing and watching her. Miss Darcy won’t look up. Elizabeth believes that if Miss Bingley had known Miss Darcy’s history with Wickham, she wouldn’t have asked this question, which was meant to hurt only Elizabeth.While Darcy walks the party out to their carriage, Miss Bingley criticizes Elizabeth to Miss Darcy, who thinks Elizabeth anything is “lovely and amiable” because “[h]er brother’s recommendation [is] enough to insure her favour [sic]” (252). When Darcy returns, Miss Bingley remarks that she “never could see any beauty” (252) in Elizabeth. Even her eyes, “which have sometimes been called so fine” (253), have nothing “extraordinary in them” (253); she also has “a self-sufficiency […] which is intolerable” (253). When Miss Bingley reminds Darcy that he once believed Elizabeth to be pretty, Darcy, fed up, responds that his feelings have since changed: he now thinks she is “one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance” (253).In the carriage ride home, Elizabeth and Mrs. Gardiner discuss everything but Darcy, the topic that “particularly interest[s] them both” (253).", "Volume 3, Chapters 1-3 Analysis": "When Elizabeth visits Pemberley, what she finds is the opposite of what she expects. Darcy’s house is a “handsome” stone house atop “a considerable eminence” (229). It sits among “high woody hills” by a beautiful stream “without any artificial appearance” (229). While the rooms are “lofty and handsome,” they are “neither gaudy nor uselessly fine” (230). These descriptions easily fit Darcy himself. Handsome and stately, he commands respect but is not ostentatious. Just as his home possesses “natural beauty” (229), he says what he means and appreciates Elizabeth’s straightforwardness, as well. The “real elegance” (230) of Darcy’s home contrasts the showy decorations of Rosings—an apt contrast, as Lady Catherine condones the servile flattery of Sir William and Mr. Collins. When Elizabeth thinks of how she “might have been mistress” (230) of Pemberley, she is symbolically expressing regret for losing Darcy himself.Meeting people who know Darcy intimately is a sobering reminder of the dangers of secondhand knowledge. Elizabeth hears glowing reports from Mrs. Reynolds, who claims that Darcy is “the best master” (233) that she has “never had a cross word from him” (232), and that all of the servants would say the same. Elizabeth asks herself, “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” (232) and is “impatient for more” (232-33). Later, the Gardiners speak with townspeople, who confirm that Wickham is not much liked and that Darcy has settled his debts. Similarly, Elizabeth, having believed Wickham’s account of her, assumed Miss Darcy would be disagreeable and proud; however, when meeting her in person, she finds that she is merely painfully shy, unable to utter barely a word.These chapters show Darcy and Elizabeth both demonstrating willingness to learn and eagerness to grow. Elizabeth finds Darcy’s manner upon meeting them at Pemberley “strikingly altered” (236); he speaks with tenderness and even asks about the very family he’d disdained in his proposal. She is delighted when Darcy invites her uncle to fish at Pemberley. When he and Miss Darcy visit her at Lambton, she notices a lack of “hauteur” and “disdain”; he seeks “the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace” and speaks with a manner “free from self-consequence or unbending reserve” (245). His change of manner demonstrates that he has taken her criticisms seriously and made an effort to remedy them. He demonstrates newfound humility and tolerance.Elizabeth can appreciate these qualities because she herself possesses them. Elizabeth, as she demonstrated in her response to Darcy’s letter, is not above assessing new information, changing her mind, and acknowledging her own missteps. She feels “shame and vexation” upon meeting Darcy at Pemberley, worrying that her touring his house after their argument casts her in “a disgraceful light” (235). Hosting him at the inn at Lambton, she is surprised to find that for the first time, she is nervous around him; with the dynamic between them new and unknown, she is “anxious to please” (243) and “to make herself agreeable to all” (244). Elizabeth, having recognized the magnitude of her misunderstanding, has been humbled. That so many characters—Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine, Wickham—lack this self-objectivity makes it all the more remarkable and admirable.", "Volume 3, Chapter 4 Summary": "On the third morning, Elizabeth receives two letters from Jane. In the first, Jane writes that an urgent message arrived from Colonel Forster informing them that Lydia and Wickham ran off together to Scotland, where many young English people eloped in order to escape the stricter marriage laws of England. Jane hopes for the best, writing that Wickham must not be after money because Lydia’s family isn’t wealthy.The second letter reveals that they now believe Lydia and Wickham did not go to Scotland. Colonel Forster has traced them to London. Jane writes that as unfortunate a marriage as it would be, they “are now anxious to be assured it has taken place” (255), for the shame of the couple living together out of wedlock would be worse. Jane thinks Lydia and Wickham might still be married, but Colonel Forster warns Wickham “[is] not a man to be trusted” (256). Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are devastated and angry with Kitty for hiding Lydia and Wickham’s plans. Jane asks Elizabeth and the Gardiners to return to Longbourn. Mr. Bennet, she writes, is going to London.Just as Elizabeth finishes reading, Darcy arrives. Unable to hide her distress, she tells him she must find Mr. Gardiner immediately; Darcy sends his servant instead. He asks her “in a tone of gentleness and commiseration” (257) if he can bring her a glass of wine.In tears, Elizabeth tells Darcy that Lydia has eloped with Wickham and that he “know[s] him too well to doubt the rest” (258). Darcy, astonished, paces up and down the room in thought. Elizabeth assumes he is thinking about this “proof of family weakness” (258), and her belief that he can no longer love her reveals to her how truly she loves him.Darcy, with “compassion,” says he wishes there were something he could do, regrets that he and his sister won’t see her at Pemberley, and “with only one serious, parting look” (259), takes his leave. Elizabeth laments that they won’t meet again with such “cordiality” (259) as they had the last few days. She has no hope that Wickham will marry Lydia, nor does she have faith in Lydia’s “virtue” or “understanding” (260).The Gardiners return and, though “Lydia [has] never been a favourite [sic] with them,” realize that “all [are] concerned in it” (261). Mr. Gardiner promises to help however he can, and the three depart for Longbourn.", "Volume 3, Chapter 5 Summary": "In the carriage, Elizabeth and the Gardiners discuss the situation. The Gardiners have hope that Lydia and Wickham are married, but Elizabeth fears the worst, believing Wickham would never marry a woman from whom he couldn’t benefit financially. She also believes Wickham must see that Lydia has no brothers to defend her and a father who has given “little attention” (263) to her behavior. When Mrs. Gardiner asks if Elizabeth really thinks Wickham is capable of such travesty, Elizabeth replies that she knows he is but can’t relate the whole story. She blames herself for not warning Lydia about Wickham, though she notes that neither Wickham nor Lydia had ever demonstrated a particular preference for the other.At Longbourn, Mrs. Bennet complains about “her own sufferings” and blames “every body but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing” (267). She blames Mr. Bennet for not letting them all go to Brighton, Wickham for his “villainous conduct” (267), the Forsters for not keeping a close eye on Lydia, and the Collinses, preemptively, for evicting them from Longbourn when Mr. Bennet is killed in a duel with Wickham.Mr. Gardiner assures Mrs. Bennet that he will join Mr. Bennet in London to help. She thanks him and instructs him to tell Lydia not to worry about her wedding clothes, that she can have as much money for clothes as she’d like after she is married.Jane shows Elizabeth the letter Lydia left Mrs. Forster. Lydia writes that she’s run off to Gretna Green—the Scottish town closest to the English border, therefore popular with elopers—to marry Wickham and that it will be “a good joke” (277) when she surprises her family with her marriage. Though Elizabeth is infuriated by the levity of the letter, she is relieved that at least Lydia had intended to be married.Jane tells Elizabeth that Mrs. Philips came to help; also, Lady Lucas visited and offered the help of herself and her daughters. Elizabeth says that at times like this, “one cannot see too little of one’s neighbors,” who should “triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied” (272).", "Volume 3, Chapter 6 Summary": "Mrs. Gardiner stays at Longbourn while Mr. Gardiner is in London. People in Meryton “[seem] striving to blacken the man who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light” (273). He’s left behind many debts and is now considered “the wickedest young man in the world” (273). They also claim to always have “distrusted the appearance of his goodness” (273). From London, Mr. Gardiner writes that Colonel Forster has been generous and kind in his help. Every day the family awaits the mail, anxious for news.A letter arrives from Mr. Collins sending sympathy for “the grievous affliction […] which no time can remove” (275). He writes that Lydia’s death “would have been a blessing in comparison of this” (275). Charlotte believes Lydia’s irresponsibility “has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence” (275), but he thinks “her own disposition must be naturally bad” (275). Lady Catherine agrees with Mr. Collins that Lydia’s behavior will impact the lives of all her sisters, for who “will connect themselves with such a family?” (276). He notes how narrowly he missed being “involved in all your sorrow and disgrace” and concludes by suggesting they “throw off” Lydia “for ever” (276).Mr. Gardiner writes that it appears Wickham has no living relations and large gaming debts. Mr. Bennet is to come home shortly; Mrs. Bennet wonders who is going “to fight Wickham, and make him marry her” (277). Mrs. Gardiner meets Mr. Gardiner in London, still considering Elizabeth’s relationship with Darcy. Elizabeth feels that “had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia’s infamy somewhat better” (277).Upon his return, Elizabeth tells Mr. Bennet she’s sorry for what he’s suffered. He says he deserves to suffer because “[i]t has been my own doing” (278). When Elizabeth objects, he tells her to “let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame” (278).Mr. Bennet makes an offhand joke about Kitty running away; she denies she would, saying if she ever goes to Brighton, she will “behave better than Lydia” (279). Mr. Bennet says not only will she never go to Brighton but he will prohibit all balls, and she can’t leave the house unless she spends “ten minutes of every day in a rational manner” (279). When Kitty cries, Mr. Bennet says that if she behaves for ten years, he’ll reconsider.", "Volume 3, Chapter 7 Summary": "Mr. Gardiner writes that he has located Lydia and Wickham and has seen them both. They aren’t married yet, but he believes they will marry soon, as long as Mr. Bennet agrees to settle upon Lydia her share of the 5,000 pounds to be split by the Bennet daughters after his death, in addition to 100 pounds a year. He adds that after Wickham’s debts are paid, money will still be left over for him and Lydia. Mr. Gardiner has taken the liberty of agreeing to these terms on Mr. Bennet’s behalf and awaits only his answer before seeing Lydia and Wickham marry.Jane and Elizabeth are ecstatic. Mr. Bennet wonders how much money Mr. Gardiner paid Wickham to ensure the marriage, believing Wickham surely isn’t only receiving the money specified in the terms. Elizabeth agrees Mr. Gardiner must have paid Wickham’s debts and worries “he has distressed himself”(282) with such a large financial investment. Mr. Bennet says “Wickham’s a fool” to marry Lydia for less than £10,000 and that he “should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship” (282).Jane holds that Wickham must love Lydia if he’s marrying her, and that it’s impossible that Mr. Gardiner has been able to contribute so much money to the cause. Elizabeth says Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner have been so kind to help Lydia and that “[i]f such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy” (283).Jane and Elizabeth share the news with Mrs. Bennet, who is all excitement. She spends no time remembering how irresponsibly Lydia has behaved; she is delighted that Lydia will be married at sixteen and relieved that her brother has taken care of everything. Her first concern is how much money Mr. Bennet will give Lydia for new clothes.Jane attempts to remind Mrs. Bennet of Mr. Gardiner’s sacrifices. Mrs. Bennet says Mr. Gardiner is Lydia’s uncle and that he should have done it. She goes to Lady Lucas’s to share the good news. Elizabeth, “sick of this folly” (285), goes to her room. She tries to be thankful that the crisis has ended as well as it could.", "Volume 3, Chapter 8 Summary": "Saving money had not seemed urgent early in the Bennets’ marriage, when they assumed they would have a son who would cut off the entail and secure the daughters’ financial futures. Mr. Bennet regrets not having saved money, for had he done so, “Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle” (286). He vows to repay Mr. Gardiner as soon as possible. He agrees to the terms Mr. Gardiner put forth and is glad to have to exert so little effort, for after the anger passes, “he naturally return[s] to all his former indolence” (287).The news spreads. People regret that Lydia’s marrying Wickham makes for more boring conversation than her becoming a prostitute or being ostracized. However, people take comfort in the fact that “with such a husband her misery [is] considered certain” (287).Mrs. Bennet, feeling no shame, is “in spirits oppressively high” (288). In her search for a house for Lydia, she “reject[s] many as deficient in size and importance” (288). Mr. Bennet tells her he will never receive Lydia and Wickham as visitors at Longbourn. Mrs. Bennet is horrified that Mr. Bennet won’t send Lydia money for clothes, wondering how he can “refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid” (288).Elizabeth wishes she hadn’t told Darcy about the elopement. She believes “a gulf impassable [exists] between them” (289), for he would never marry into a family connected with Wickham. Feeling more than ever that she could have loved him, she realizes that “in disposition and talents” (289) he is actually perfect for her, that their marriage “must have been to the advantage of both” (290). She has no hope for Lydia and Wickham’s happiness, for they were “only brought together because their passions [are] stronger than their virtue” (290).Mr. Gardiner writes to Mr. Bennet that, on his advice, Wickham is joining the army. Colonel Forster is letting Wickham’s creditors near Brighton know that they will soon be paid and asks that Mr. Bennet do the same for creditors in Meryton. The family is happy for the news—all except Mrs. Bennet, who laments that Lydia has to move away.Lydia wants to visit before they depart for the north. Mr. Bennet at first refuses to let them, but Jane and Elizabeth convince him to receive them.", "Volume 3, Chapter 9 Summary": "Lydia and Wickham are married, and they visit Longbourn. Mrs. Bennet is thrilled, while Mr. Bennet scarcely speaks. Elizabeth and even Jane are “disgusted” and “shocked” by Lydia’s “untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless” behavior as she unapologetically “turn[s] from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations” (293). Lydia eagerly wants to know if everyone in town knows she’s married; Elizabeth runs out of the room, joining the family again only when they sit down for dinner.Lydia tells Jane that she now has the right to sit at her mother’s right side, that Jane “must go lower, because I am a married woman” (294). Lydia grows bolder and bolder as the day goes on, saying she wants to meet all her friends to hear them call her “Mrs. Wickham” and to “boast of being married” (294). She says all her sisters must “envy” her for her “charming” (294) husband and that they all should have gone to Brighton so the other girls could find husbands. She says that if her sisters visit her in the north, she will be sure to find dancing partners for them. Mrs. Bennet eagerly agrees to this plan.Lydia and Wickham stay for ten days, and many parties are thrown. Elizabeth finds that Wickham, as she’d expected, does not love Lydia as much as Lydia loves him. Elizabeth is convinced that he wouldn’t have married her, that he’d intended to flee only because of “distress of circumstances” (295), and that he merely didn’t object to Lydia joining him.Despite Elizabeth’s objections, Lydia tells Elizabeth about her wedding. She had been eager for it to take place and wondered if Wickham would wear his blue coat. She relates that Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had been “horrid unpleasant” to her and that they hadn’t let her out of the house for two weeks. In giving her account of that day, she offhandedly mentions that Darcy was at the wedding. Elizabeth is stunned. Lydia says she wasn’t supposed to mention Darcy’s presence, that it was supposed to be a secret; Elizabeth doesn’t question her but, impatient to know more, runs out of the room to immediately, in order to write a letter to Mrs. Gardiner asking why Darcy had been “where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go” (297).", "Volume 3, Chapter 10 Summary": "Mrs. Gardiner writes that the day she returned from Longbourn, Darcy visited Mr. Gardiner to tell him he’d spoken with Lydia and Wickham. His motive, he said, was that he blamed himself for the fact that Wickham’s true character wasn’t known and felt it was “his duty to step forward” (299). Mrs. Gardiner suggests he perhaps had another motive.Darcy learned Lydia and Wickham’s location from Mrs. Younge, who was in charge of Miss Darcy when she eloped with Wickham. He tried to convince Lydia to return home, but Lydia refused. Darcy realized the next best option was to ensure the marriage. Wickham told Darcy he’d been forced to leave because of “debts of honour which were very pressing” and, at the very least, “scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone” (300). He admitted he hadn’t married Lydia because he hoped to marry a wealthier woman. However, Wickham ended up succumbing to “the temptation of immediately relief” (300). Darcy and Wickham met several times to talk about the terms of Wickham’s marrying Lydia. Once this was accomplished, Darcy spoke with Mr. Gardiner about the plan.Mrs. Gardiner writes that Darcy did everything himself but required that Mr. Gardiner take the credit, “which went sorely against the grain” (301). Mr. Gardiner was glad for Elizabeth’s letter, which required him to relinquish “his borrowed feathers” (301).After the wedding, Mrs. Gardiner lectured Lydia on her distressing behavior, to no avail. At the end of her letter, Mrs. Gardiner tells Elizabeth how much she likes Darcy, how he lacks only “liveliness,” which “his wife may teach him” if he marries “prudently” (302). She adds that she would like to explore more of Pemberley.Elizabeth is overcome by Darcy’s “exertion of goodness” (303). She thinks about the “trouble and mortification” he endured to “bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid” and dares to hope he did it for her (303). Her family owes “every thing to him” (303), and she regrets every “ungracious sensation she had every encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him” (304).Wickham approaches. He says they were always friends, and she agrees. They discuss her time visiting Pemberley, and Elizabeth subtly reveals she knows the truth of his story. She tells him that as they are now brother and sister, they shouldn’t quarrel, and he kisses her hand.", "Volume 3, Chapters 4-10 Analysis": "The happy resolution at the end of Chapter 3 explodes into a final burst of suspense in Chapter 4. The chapters that follow offer the final push for Darcy to show his integrity and heroism. They also offer opportunities for other important characters to show their true colors.When Elizabeth is at Pemberley, she longingly wonders what it would have been like to be mistress and consoles herself by thinking she wouldn’t be allowed the pleasure of inviting Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. Similarly, when she introduces the Gardiners to Darcy, she expects Darcy to run “as fast as he [can] from such disgraceful companions” (238). When Elizabeth reveals to Darcy that Lydia has eloped with Wickham, he paces the floor; she assumes he can no longer love her when her family is in “the deepest disgrace” (258). She is wrong, however, on all counts. Darcy is warm and engaging with the Gardiners and not only invites Mr. Gardiner to fish at Pemberley but also visits him in London to discuss Lydia and Wickham. When Darcy paces the floor upon hearing of the elopement, he is likely thinking of how he can help, for he leaves to track them the very next day. Finally, Darcy’s love for Elizabeth does withstand the scandal and the resulting connection with Wickham. When Elizabeth learns of Darcy’s role in the marriage of Wickham and Lydia, she understands, finally, his “goodness,” and she senses that despite the obstacles, “he had done it for her” (303).Just as Darcy solidifies his integrity, Lydia and Mrs. Bennet solidify their incorrigibility. Mrs. Bennet expresses nothing but delight at Lydia’s marriage, calling Wickham “dear Wickham” and exclaiming that they will have a “merry” (284) time when they meet. She fixates on procuring Lydia new clothes, showing a lack of appreciation for the sacrifices they believe Mr. Gardiner to have made. In fact, when Mr. Bennet refuses to send money for Lydia’s clothes, Mrs. Bennet is “more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place” (288). Like Mrs. Bennet, Lydia feels no shame over the effects her behavior has had on her family. Failing to see the seriousness, she treats the situation like a game. Her letter to Mrs. Forster speaks of “[w]hat a good joke” her elopement is and how she “can hardly write for laughing” (271). When she returns to Longbourn, she acts superior to Jane and Elizabeth. Even her account of the wedding to Elizabeth demonstrates her thoughtlessness and naiveté: she complains that the Gardiners were rude to her and doesn’t understand why they wouldn’t let her leave the house.Mr. Bennet tells Elizabeth he deserves to suffer because Lydia’s elopement is his fault; however, it isn’t long before he “return[s] to all his former indolence” (287). Lydia herself, who believes Wickham is “an angel” she should “never be happy without” (271), is too naive to see that his love for her is “not equal to” (295) her love for him. Darcy shows humility in paying Wickham’s debts anonymously, though glimpses of his honor have been shown in Mrs. Reynolds’ reports of his generosity to the poor. As for Elizabeth, she finally sees that “he was exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her” (289).", "Volume 3, Chapter 11 Summary": "Mrs. Bennet is sad to lose Lydia and tells her to write; Lydia says “married women have never much time for writing” (306-07) but that her sisters can write to her because “[t]hey will have nothing else to do” (307). Wickham is charming as ever upon leaving. Mr. Bennet, snidely noting his flattering manner, says he is “prodigiously proud of him” and that even Sir William can’t “produce a more valuable son-in-law” (307).News that Bingley is to return to Netherfield brightens Mrs. Bennet’s “spiritless condition” (307). Jane claims to have no interest in him and that he’s welcome at Netherfield if he wants to go. She assures Elizabeth that she only feels self-conscious because she knows people are thinking of her, but Elizabeth doesn’t believe her. Elizabeth feels Bingley has come down alone because he still loves Jane and that Darcy has given his blessing.Mrs. Bennet once again asks her husband to visit Bingley. Mr. Bennet says he will not, that last time she asked him to visit Bingley he’d been promised he would marry one of his daughters. He says Bingley can visit if he wants to, that “[h]e knows where we live” (309).Bingley and Darcy visit Longbourn. As they approach the house, Mrs. Bennet says she “hate[s] the very sight” (310) of Darcy. Jane feels sympathy for Elizabeth, but she still doesn’t know that Darcy is that man to whom “the whole family [are] indebted” (310) and that Elizabeth is falling in love with him. Elizabeth cautiously hopes that Darcy’s feelings for her have not changed and is embarrassed when Mrs. Bennet receives Bingley too warmly and Darcy too coldly.Darcy does not speak frequently as he did when he was visiting Elizabeth and the Gardiners, and Elizabeth is disappointed. Mrs. Bennet tells Bingley that he must have seen Lydia’s marriage in the papers; Bingley says he did and congratulates her. Mrs. Bennet makes a remark about Wickham not having as many friends as he’d like; mortified, Elizabeth changes the subject. Mrs. Bennet continues to embarrass herself and her daughters with her “officious attention” (313). However, when Elizabeth sees how Bingley clearly is still so enamored of Jane, she is heartened.", "Volume 3, Chapter 12 Summary": "Elizabeth can’t understand why Darcy visited if he was going to “be silent, grave, and indifferent” (314). She vows not to think about him again. Jane tries to convince her that she and Bingley are “indifferent” (315) to each other, making Elizabeth laugh.Bingley and Darcy return a few days later for a dinner party at Longbourn. Elizabeth is dismayed when Darcy is seated far away from her at the table, but close to her mother, whose “ungraciousness [makes] the sense of what they [owe] him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind” (316). In the drawing room, circumstances prevent them from being near each other; the one time they are, they engage in brief, awkward conversation before separating again. They are placed at different tables at cards, and then Bingley and Darcy depart.Mrs. Bennet is delighted by the success of the evening and is sure Jane will marry Bingley after all. Jane continues to insist she sees Bingley only “as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it” (318). She begs Elizabeth to stop smiling at her and insisting she isn’t telling the truth.", "Volume 3, Chapter 13 Summary": "Bingley visits several times, alone, as Darcy is in London. He and Mr. Bennet go shooting one morning. Mr. Bennet finds “nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence” (321) and therefore is friendlier than Bingley has ever seen him.That evening Bingley proposes to Jane, making Jane “the happiest creature in the world” (322). After requesting permission from Mr. Bennet, Bingley asks Elizabeth for her best wishes, which Elizabeth readily gives, believing they will be truly happy together because they have “excellent understanding,” “super-excellent disposition,” and “a general similarity of feeling and taste” (323).After Bingley leaves, Mr. Bennet congratulates Jane and says she will be very happy, that she is “a good girl” (323),and that he has “great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled” (323). He says she and Bingley are both “so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on,” that “every servant will cheat” (323) them, and that they are “so generous” that they “will always exceed” their income (323). Mrs. Bennet says it’s impossible for them to exceed Mr. Bingley’s large income and that she has always known Jane “could not be so beautiful for nothing” (324). Jane now becomes her “favourite [sic] child” (324).Bingley visits frequently. Jane is glad to learn he’d had no idea she was in London the previous spring and believes “[i]t must have been his sisters’ doing” (324). She says that once his sisters see he is so happy, they will “learn to be contented” (325). She tells Elizabeth that he still loved her when he went to London and stayed away only because he thought she didn’t love him. Elizabeth is happy to discover that Bingley hasn’t told Jane that Darcy was instrumental in keeping him away. Jane wants Elizabeth to be as happy as she is; Elizabeth says that “[t]ill I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness” (325).News of the engagement travels quickly, and the Bennets are said to be “the luckiest family in the world,” even though only a few weeks before “they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune” (325).", "Volume 3, Chapter 14 Summary": "One day, Lady Catherine visits Longbourn, shocking everyone. Mrs. Bennet is honored, offering Lady Catherine something to eat, which Lady Catherine refuses. Lady Catherine haughtily comments that their estate is “very small” and that their sitting room looks “most inconvenient” (327). She asks Elizabeth to walk with her outside.Lady Catherine tells Elizabeth that she’s heard that Elizabeth and Darcy are to be married and that “it must be a scandalous falsehood” (328). Elizabeth replies that she doesn’t know why Lady Catherine would visit if she believed it to be a falsehood. Growing exasperated, Lady Catherine asks Elizabeth if it’s true; Elizabeth tells her that she chooses not to answer her questions.Lady Catherine “insist[s] on being satisfied” and asks if Darcy has proposed to her, to which Elizabeth responds that Lady Catherine has “declared it to be impossible” (329). Lady Catherine reminds Elizabeth who she is, that she is not “accustomed to such language as this,” and that she’s “entitled” to know Darcy’s “dearest concerns” (329). Elizabeth responds that she is not entitled to know hers and that Lady Catherine’s rudeness makes her unlikely to answer. Lady Catherine says Darcy is engaged to her daughter; Elizabeth replies that if that’s true, Lady Catherine has no reason to fear he’s proposed to her. Lady Catherine warns that if she marries Darcy, she will “be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him” (330). She is happy when Elizabeth admits that she and Darcy are not engaged but is further angered when Elizabeth refuses to promise it won’t ever happen. Elizabeth tells Lady Catherine, “You have widely mistaken my character” (331), adding that Lady Catherine has “no right to concern” (332) herself in her life.Lady Catherine says she’s aware of Lydia’s situation and that Darcy can’t be connected to her family, asking, “Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?” (332). Elizabeth tells Lady Catherine she has insulted her “in every possible method” (332) and that the conversation is over; Lady Catherine accuses her of being “[u]nfeeling” and “selfish” (332). Elizabeth promises only to make choices for her own happiness with no regard for Lady Catherine or anyone else.Back at the house, Lady Catherine rudely takes her leave. Mrs. Bennet says Lady Catherine is “a very fine-looking woman” (333) and that it was “civil” (333) of her to call. She asks Elizabeth what they talked about, and Elizabeth concocts a lie.", "Volume 3, Chapters 11-14 Analysis": "The falling action, in which the dust settles after the explosive climax, has seen new conflicts and surprises. With Lydia married and Darcy’s identity as her savior revealed, characters demonstrate the lessons they’ve learned (or haven’t learned) and offer hints as to how they will handle their new world.Despite Mrs. Bennet’s vehement requests, Mr. Bennet refuses to visit Bingley, citing the fact that she’d insisted on its necessity last time, when in fact it came to nothing. Bingley, Mr. Bennet says, “knows where we live,” and he “will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours [sic] every time they go away and come back again” (309). After tumultuous recent events, social conventions seem silly and pointless, and the necessity of visiting is now “an etiquette I despise” (309).Wary of being hurt again and of misreading Bingley’s intentions, Jane protects herself by feigning indifference. She claims not to care if Bingley is in town one way or the other: she says “that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain” (308), that they see each other “only as common and indifferent acquaintance” (315), and that she has “no wish” (318) beyond friendship. Only when Bingley proposes does she “have no reserves from Elizabeth” (322).Elizabeth, knowing what Darcy has done for her family, is even more embarrassed by her mother’s rude behavior than before. When Mrs. Bennet states that she “hate[s] the very sight” of Darcy, Elizabeth is uncomfortable, knowing Darcy is “the person to whom the whole family [are] indebted” (310). When Mrs. Bennet is “cold and ceremonious” with Darcy, Elizabeth is “hurt and distressed,” for “her mother owe[s]”to Darcy “the preservation of her favourite [sic] daughter from irremediable infamy” (311).As she does in Derbyshire after Darcy’s letter forced her to see Darcy in a new, admirable light, Elizabeth behaves toward Darcy with nervousness and reservation—as opposed to her careless ease the year before, when his true character was still unknown to her. She wishes to be near him and laments when they’re kept apart at cards; when they do speak, it’s stilted and superficial, neither knowing how to behave. This is a marked difference from their interactions at Netherfield, which are sharp, thoughtful, and intelligent, and which distinguish them not only from other characters but also as for a good match for each other. Elizabeth feels anxious for the renewal of their freely flowing conversation.Elizabeth stands firm in the face of insults to herself and her family. Unimpressed by Lady Catherine’s claims to what she wants by mere virtue of her wealth and status, Elizabeth deftly avoids answering questions, and by asking pointed questions of her own, she manages to reveal Lady Catherine’s hypocrisy—even, at one point, asking her why she worries Darcy will propose to her if he’s already engaged to Miss de Bourgh, a point that forces Lady Catherine to pause and collect herself. Elizabeth’s trademark wit, which we’ve previously seen leveled at Darcy, is used here to combat the rudeness and entitlement of Lady Catherine. Her staunchness in refusing Lady Catherine her wish—a promise that she will never marry Darcy—demonstrates not only her refusal to bow to the aristocracy but also her true feelings about Darcy.", "Volume 3, Chapter 15 Summary": "Elizabeth is fearful that Lady Catherine will come between her and Darcy by repeating to him all the concerns she has over their hypothetical marriage and that Darcy’s “notions of dignity” (334) will force him to conclude that her arguments “[contain] much good sense and solid reasoning” (335). She doesn’t know how much he depends on his aunt for guidance, but “[i]f he had been wavering before” about whether to attempt a relationship with her, Lady Catherine’s interference would “settle every doubt” and inspire him decide to “be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him” (335).The next day, Mr. Bennet asks to speak to Elizabeth privately. He tells her, expressing his shock, that Mr. Collins has written to acknowledge that it appears Elizabeth is about to be married to Darcy and that Lady Catherine disapproves of the match. Mr. Bennet also expresses irritation that Mr. Collins chastises him for having received Lydia and Wickham in his house.Mr. Bennet expects Elizabeth will be surprised by this news, telling her that Mr. Collins could not have picked a man less likely to marry Elizabeth, that if they had picked “any other man it would have been nothing” (338), but Darcy’s “perfect indifference” and Elizabeth’s “pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd” (338). He says he hates writing but enjoys having Mr. Collins as a writing partner: he gives Mr. Collins “preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law” (338).Elizabeth can barely put on a smile and laugh off what her father has said; her father’s comments about Darcy’s indifference have hurt her and have made her wonder not if he was “seeing too little” (338) but rather if “she might have fancied too much” (338).", "Volume 3, Chapter 16 Summary": "When Bingley and Darcy next call at Longbourn, Elizabeth thanks Darcy “again and again” (339) for helping Lydia; he reiterates that he didn’t want her to know because it would cause her “uneasiness” and that “the wish of giving happiness to you” (339) was most in his thoughts. He states that his feelings haven’t changed since last spring; he asks if her feelings are the same and tells her that if they are, he won’t mention it again. When Elizabeth confirms her feelings have changed, he experiences “happiness […] such as he had probably never felt before” as he tells her “of what importance she [is] to him” (340). Lady Catherine had told him about her conversation with Elizabeth and it had given him hope, for if Elizabeth had no intention of marrying him, she would have told Lady Catherine so.When Elizabeth makes a joke about her “abusing” him “so abominably,” Darcy asks, “‘What did you say of me that I did not deserve?’” (341). He believes his behavior was “unpardonable,” and he “cannot think of it without abhorrence” (341). Elizabeth says they should not “quarrel for the greater share of blame,” for they have both “improved in civility” (341). Darcy tells her that her words the day of his proposal affected him deeply; she, too, regrets what she said and says “all her former prejudices [have] been removed” (342). When Darcy expresses regret over the wording in his letter, Elizabeth says they should forget the letter because “[t]he feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then” (342).Darcy says he has “been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle” (342) and still might be had it not been for her. He has learned “a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous,” and has been “properly humbled” (343). He’d proposed expecting to be accepted, but “a woman worthy of being pleased” (343) deserves more.When they met at Pemberley, Darcy says, he wanted to demonstrate that he had taken her words to heart. He confirms that he’d given Bingley his blessing in proposing to Jane: after watching Jane during their recent visits and determining she truly did love him, he’d confessed to Bingley that he’d been mistaken about his feelings regarding Jane’s affection for him.", "Volume 3, Chapter 17 Summary": "Elizabeth is worried about her family’s reaction to her engagement. Jane at first doesn’t believe her. She begs Elizabeth to “do any thing rather than marry without affection” (346). Elizabeth tells her the complete story, including the events related to Bingley and to Darcy’s role in helping Lydia, and Jane is satisfied that Elizabeth will be happy. Elizabeth and Darcy agree that Darcy will ask for Mr. Bennet’s consent that night and that Elizabeth will talk to her mother herself: she is worried that Mrs. Bennet’s reaction will be embarrassing.After Darcy receives consent from Mr. Bennet, Elizabeth speaks with her father. He asks how she could marry a man she hates, and Elizabeth regrets having spoken so ill of Darcy. Mr. Bennet believes Elizabeth must be marrying him because he is rich and that he is “a proud, unpleasant sort of man” (349). Elizabeth cries that she truly loves him and that her father does “not know what he really is” (349).Mr. Bennet says Darcy “is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask” (349). He is concerned that Elizabeth could not be happy “unless you truly [esteem] your husband” and that her “lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage” (349). Elizabeth finally convinces her father she loves Darcy, noting that his love “[has] stood the test of many months’ suspense” (350). Her father states, “I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy” (350).Elizabeth confesses Darcy’s role in Lydia’s marriage. Mr. Bennet is overjoyed: had his brother-in-law invested the money, he would have paid him back, but Darcy, madly in love, will refuse.That night, Elizabeth tells her mother about her engagement. After sitting silently in shock, Mrs. Bennet proclaims how delighted she is, how rich Elizabeth will be, and how “charming” and “handsome” she finds Darcy. Mrs. Bennet hopes Darcy “will overlook” (351) her previous dislike of him and says that this marriage dwarfs even Jane’s.Elizabeth fears how her mother will behave in front of Darcy. However, the next day, Mrs. Bennet, in her “awe” (352), says little. Mr. Bennet, who makes an effort to get to know Darcy and who likes him more and more, says Wickham is his favourite [sic] son-in-law but that he’ll like Bingley and Darcy equally.", "Volume 3, Chapter 18 Summary": "Darcy and Elizabeth discuss when he fell in love with her. Elizabeth asks if he “admire[d] me for my impertinence” (352); he says he admired her “[f]or the liveliness of your mind” (352). Elizabeth says he was “sick of civility” and “disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone” and that she “roused and interested you, because I was so unlike them” (353).She engages him in teasing banter about how he should “exaggerate” her “good qualities” and that she must “find occasions for teasing and quarrelling” (353) with him. She comments that “Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use” (354). When Darcy says he will write to tell Lady Catherine right away, Elizabeth says she will sit by him “and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did” (354).Elizabeth writes to Mrs. Gardiner, thanking her for sharing what she knew about Darcy. She also thanks her for not going to the Lakes and says they “are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas” (355).Mr. Bennet writes a letter to Mr. Collins, telling him Darcy and Elizabeth are engaged, that he should “[c]onsole Lady Catherine,” but that in his shoes, he “would stand by the nephew,” who “has more to give” (355).Miss Bingley writes to Jane with “all her former professions of regard” (355). Jane, now knowing her character, feels “no reliance on her” but writes her “a much kinder answer than she [knows is] deserved” (355).Charlotte and Mr. Collins come to visit because Charlotte wants to be away from Lady Catherine, who is furious at the news. Elizabeth’s delight at seeing Charlotte is equaled only by her dismay at seeing Mr. Collins fawn over Darcy. However, Darcy tolerates it “with admirable calmness” (356).Mrs. Philips is “vulgar” (356) in her manners despite her awe of Darcy, and though Elizabeth is mortified, she feels his ability to bear it bodes well for the future. She’s excited for a time when they are away from everyone at Pemberley.", "Volume 3, Chapter 19 Summary": "Mrs. Bennet is thrilled the day she gets “rid of her two most deserving daughters” (357). The narrator wishes she could relate that Mrs. Bennet became “a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman” but notes Mr. Bennet “might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form” (357).Mr. Bennet misses Elizabeth and goes often to Pemberley. Jane and Bingley stay at Netherfield for a year before their close proximity to Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips taxes their patience. Bingley buys an estate near Derbyshire. Jane and Elizabeth live only thirty miles from each other.Kitty spends most of her time with Jane or Elizabeth, and “[i]n society so superior to what she had generally known […] her improvement [is] great” (357). Lydia frequently invites Kitty to visit, promising “balls and young men” (358), but Mr. Bennet refuses to let her go.Wickham and Lydia live above their means, and Lydia’s congratulatory letter to Elizabeth asks for financial help. Elizabeth does not mention it to Darcy but does send Lydia some of her own money occasionally. Lydia and Wickham constantly move around, looking for cheaper housing. Their affection for each other dwindles, his a little faster than hers.Darcy’s marriage devastates Miss Bingley, but she affects an air of civility in order to be allowed to continue visiting Pemberley.Georgiana Darcy lives at Pemberley, and she and Elizabeth love each other dearly. At first, Georgiana “listen[s] with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of talking to her brother” (359).Elizabeth teaches her “that a woman may take liberties with her husband” (359).Lady Catherine sends Darcy a letter so harsh as to make him stop speaking with her entirely until, at Elizabeth’s coaxing, he renews the relationship. Lady Catherine eventually receives them at Rosings, curious “to see how his wife conduct[s] herself” (360). Elizabeth receives Lady Catherine at Pemberley “in spite of that pollution which its woods had received” (360) from Elizabeth and the Gardiners.Darcy and Elizabeth love and cherish the Gardiners and are grateful they brought them together.", "Volume 3, Chapters 15-19 Analysis": "The final chapters of Pride and Prejudice compare different marriages and offer hope that women can, in fact, marry for love and be happy. Jane and Bingley, with their kindness, optimism, and amiability, have been established as a good match and finally become engaged. Quips Mr. Bennet, “You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income” (323). Elizabeth and Darcy, too, are well suited to each other. Elizabeth has finally come to realize he would be “softened” by “her ease and liveliness” and she would learn “from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world” (290). Just as Jane and Bingley agree to move away from Meryton, Elizabeth and Darcy work together to handle their delicate relationships with Wickham, Lydia, and Lady Catherine. The final paragraph of the book describes how both Darcy and Elizabeth love and respect the Gardiners, thus concluding with a reminder of how they are of similar minds.In contrast, Lydia and Wickham live a troubled, transient life, and their affection for each other quickly dwindles. The narrator notes that Mrs. Bennet doesn’t become more sensible and that perhaps Mr. Bennet prefers it this way. Mr. Bennet, however, begs Elizabeth to not let him “have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life” (350), suggesting he doesn’t want to see her suffer as he has. With so many examples of unhappy marriages, Mr. Bennet seeks to save her from the same fate.Importantly, Elizabeth achieves happiness by being herself, even though others in the novel—Lady Catherine, Mr. Collins, and even Mrs. Bennet—chastise her for her frankness and independence. Elizabeth’s intellect and honesty are what bring her and Darcy together, a fact reflected in Darcy’s second proposal when he says she is “too generous to trifle with me” and that she should tell him “at once” if she still dislikes him (340). In fact, Elizabeth’s frankness leads to Darcy having the courage to propose again in the first place, for he knows that had she “been absolutely, irrevocably” against marrying him, she would have told Lady Catherine “frankly and openly” (341).As previously established, Elizabeth and Darcy are similar not only in their frankness but also in their willingness to grow and to admit their flaws. Darcy speaks honestly of the change her criticisms wrought and how he was “properly humbled” (343) by them despite the fact that they “tortured” him. Elizabeth, too, is “heartily ashamed” (341) of her behavior and acknowledges their growth in her comment that the two of them are “widely different” (342) from what they were before. Elizabeth also shows growth when, in speaking with her father about her engagement to Darcy, she wishes her “former opinions had been more reasonable” (349) and expressed with more moderation.Elizabeth’s snide comment that “Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use” (354) reflects the triumph of the deserving. Lady Catherine’s arrogance, though powerful over the likes of Mr. Collins, ultimately is weaker than integrity and love. The fact that Lady Catherine’s haughtiness brings about the exact conclusion she seeks to prevent suggests that those who look down on others do not accomplish the ends they seek."}}, "num_tokens": 166933}

Despite difficult early years, he became the best-selling writer of his time.  In 1824, young Charles was withdrawn from school and forced to work at a boot-blacking factory when his improvident father—in fact, his entire family, except for him—was sent to debtor’s prison, where they remained for three months. Once they were released, Charles attended a private school for three years. The young man then became a solicitor’s clerk, mastered shorthand, and before long was employed as a Parliamentary reporter. When he was in his early twenties, Dickens began to publish stories and sketches of London life in a variety of periodicals.  It was the publication of The Pickwick Papers (1836-1837) that catapulted the twenty-five-year-old author to national renown. Dickens wrote with unequaled speed and often worked on several novels at a time, publishing them first in monthly installments and then as books. His early novels Oliver Twist (1837-1838), Nicholas Nickleby (1838-1839), The Old Curiosity Shop (1840-1841), and A Christmas Carol (1843) solidified his enormous, ongoing popularity. When Dickens was in his late thirties, his social criticism became biting, his humor dark, and his view of poverty darker still. David Copperfield (1849-1850), Bleak House (1852-1853), Hard Times (1854), A Tale of Two Cities (1859), Great Expectations (1860-1861), and Our Mutual Friend (1864-1865) are the great works of his masterful and prolific later period.  In 1858 Dickens’s twenty-three-year marriage to Catherine Hogarth dissolved when he fell in love with Ellen Ternan, a young actress. The last years of his life were filled with intense activity: writing, managing amateur theatricals, and undertaking several reading tours that reinforced the public’s favorable view of his work but took an enormous toll on his health. Working feverishly to the last, Dickens collapsed and died on June 9, 1870, leaving The Mystery of Edwin Drood uncompleted. \n\n THE WORLD OF CHARLES DICKENS AND A TALE OF TWO CITIES      \n\n INTRODUCTION  In 1855, at a time of brewing public resentment over the slowness of political reform and a disastrous military failure in Crimea, Charles Dickens wrote to the liberal parliamentarian A. H. Layard of the imminent danger of social revolution in England:  I believe the discontent to be so much the worse for smouldering instead of blazing openly, that it is extremely like the general mind of France before the breaking out of the first Revolution, and is in danger of being turned by any one of a thousand accidents—a bad harvest—the last strain too much of aristocratic insolence or incapacity—a defeat abroad—a mere chance at home—into such a Devil of a conflagration as never has been beheld since ( Letters , vol. 7, p. 587; see “For Further Reading”).   A Tale of Two Cities , which Dickens sat down to write a few years later, is only in part a “historical” novel. On Dickens’s mind was not so much the state of France in 1789, as the current state of England, and his fear of public riots and mob violence in the streets of London. Karl Marx, in an article for the New York Daily Tribune , wrote that Dickens had “issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together” (August 1, 1854); but, unlike Marxism, Dickens’s politics were essentially a matter of inexhaustible personal sympathy, not an abstract program of social change. To the extent he conceptualized in groups at all, the dominant author of the Victorian age saw himself as a leader of a new, aspirant middle class in British society, one that concentrated its reformist energies on Parliament, and whose values of family, charity, and fair-dealing far transcended the brutish will of any mob. Dickens’s lack of sympathy for the Parisian sansculottes in A Tale of Two Cities is thus directly correlated to his apprehensiveness over revolutionary rumblings at home. Dickens had a grand social vision for his own city of London, but it did not rhyme with liberté, egalité, fraternité.  Dickens invented Victorian London as a theater of the imagination, and in his sixteen novels he ushered literally thousands of characters onto that stage. The colorful Dickensian army of Pickwicks, Micaw bers, and Little Nells—not types, but singular, unrepeatable citizens of the metropolis—formed a line of imaginative defense against what Dickens perceived as the darker potential of urbanized humanity: their transformation into an undifferentiated mass, a mob. In 1849 he attended a public execution for the purpose of observing the behavior of the crowd, and came away horrified by what he had seen:  I believe that a sight so inconceivably awful as the wickedness and levity of the immense crowd collected at that execution this morning could be imagined by no man . . . thieves, low prostitutes, ruffians and vagabonds of every kind, flocked to the ground, with every variety of foul and offensive behaviour. Fightings, faintings, whistlings, imitations of Punch, brutal jokes, tumultuous demonstrations of indecent delight when swooning women were dragged out of the crowd by the police with their dresses disordered, gave a new zest to the general excitement. When the sun rose brightly—as it did—it gilded thousands upon thousands of upturned faces, so inexpressibly odious in their brutal mirth or callousness, that a man had cause to feel ashamed of the shape he wore, and to shrink from himself, as fashioned in the image of the Devil ( The Times , November 14, 1849).   Dickens writes here in his role as concerned citizen and liberal reformer, but the letter reads like a draft for one of the famous crowd scenes in A Tale of Two Cities .There is one apparent discrepancy:The scene is London, not Paris—Horsemonger Lane, not the Place de la Révolution. But for Dickens, the “brutal mirth” and “callousness” of the mob, as a destructive social menace, transcends national boundaries: It is the same tale in both cities. The first depiction of a mob we see in the novel is in fact an English one, an “ogreish” swarm of “blue-flies” at Charles Darnay’s trial at the Old Bailey. At his unexpected acquittal, “the crowd came pouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in search of other carrion” (pp. 80-81).  In the preface to his gripping novel of mob violence, Dickens acknowledges his debt to Thomas Carlyle’s dramatic history, The French  Revolution (1837). Carlyle was the first writer to convincingly evoke the world-historical energies of the event itself, which transformed not only France, but dragged all Europe into a maelstrom of war and political upheaval from which eventually emerged the modern nation-states of the continent we recognize today. Carlyle’s swirling tumultuous prose, full of breathless outrages and bloody imagery, is a true revolutionary register, and Dickens knew well he could not improve upon it. But if the thrilling set pieces of A Tale of Two Cities —the storming of the Bastille, the September massacres—recall Carlyle, Dickens’s damning judgment of the mob more closely echoes conservative politician and theorist Edmund Burke. In 1790, in the midst of the first great shock of events in France, Burke described the abduction of the King and Queen in terms that sent a permanent shiver through the British body politic:  History will record that on the morning of the 6th of October, 1789, the king and queen of France, after a day of confusion, alarm, dismay, and slaughter, lay down, under the pledged security of public faith, to indulge nature in a few hours of respite and troubled, melancholy repose. . . . A band of cruel ruffians and assassins, reeking with blood, rushed into the chamber of the queen and pierced with a hundred strokes of bayonets and poniards the bed, from whence this persecuted woman had but just time to fly almost naked, and, through ways unknown to the murderers, had escaped to seek refuge at the feet of a king and husband not secure of his own life for a moment. This king, to say no more of him, and this queen, and their infant children (who once would have been the pride and hope of a great and generous people) were then forced to abandon the sanctuary of the most splendid palace in the world, which they left swimming in blood, polluted by massacre and strewed with scattered limbs and mutilated carcasses ( Reflections on the Revolution in France , p. 62).   In his novel of the Revolution, Dickens expresses pity, even outrage for the downtrodden individuals under the yoke of France’s ancien régime and abhors that regime itself; but once its oppressed citizens transform themselves into a mob, he is filled with the same disgust and horror he experienced at the hanging at Horsemonger Lane. Dickens never concedes the loftiness of French revolutionary ideals,  because his vision is filled with Burkean images of the revolutionary militias, whose pitiless violence renounced not only human ideals but reason itself:  The mad joy over the prisoners who were saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and dress the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man with the gentlest solicitude—had made a litter for him and escorted him carefully from the spot—had then caught up their weapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it (p. 269).   In many of Dickens’s novels, it is children who experience the keenest terror, trapped in an adult world of violent caprice and cynicism in which they have no power to defend themselves. Pip’s encounter with Magwitch on the marshes in Great Expectations is the most convincing description of childhood fear in literature, and David Copperfield’s persecution at the hands of the Murdstones has the power of archetype, a modern-day “Hansel and Gretel.” Dickens’s success in evoking the terror of the mob in A Tale of Two Cities (it is what most readers remember long after they have forgotten Lucie, Darnay, and the rest) lies in his transferring those real and imagined terrors of childhood, of which he is the fictional master, to the adult world and the stage of history. Returning to his native Paris, Doctor Manette stumbles into a scene of infantile nightmare: a world where bullies and gangs and revenges and tattletales are removed from the relative security of the playground to the public square turned death trap. The Manettes and their entourage, the grown-up “innocents” of the tale, fight for survival in this murderous topsy-turvy city, where the helplessness and dread of childhood seem once again the permanent conditions of existence; presiding over the carnage is the totemic Guillotine, like some monstrous, deadly toy  come to life and let loose in the playroom: “Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble hollow and harsh. Six tumbrils carry the day’s wine to La Guillotine. All the devouring and insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself, are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine” (p. 367).  When Dickens expressed to A. H. Layard his fear of revolution in Britain in 1855, he only echoed many dozens of commentators over the preceding six decades, who wondered why mob violence could not simply cross the English Channel and turn the streets of London into a bloodbath of class retribution. The textbook historian’s answer points to the bloodless coup of 1688, the so-called Glorious Revolution, which saw the tyrant James II forced into exile, and William and Mary inaugurate a form of managerial rule in Britain, a constitutional, “mixed” monarchy where many absolute powers of the Crown were ceded to Parliament. With the consolidation of that legislative body, however unrepresentative, Britain’s nobility insured itself against the apocalyptic disaster that was to befall their French counterparts. The divergent tale of the two cities thus begins in 1688.  But as a novelist, Dickens, who loved Paris and traveled there often, offers more intuitive, closely observed reasons for the untranslatable quality of that city’s Revolution. In an 1856 article for his weekly magazine, Household Words , he calls Paris “the Moon,” and describes a culture of spectacle implicitly alien to his London readers. On the grand Parisian boulevards, Dickens watches the upper classes put on “a mighty show.” Later, he takes coffee and a cigar at one of Paris’s ubiquitous cafés, and participates in a kind of collective voyeurism unfamiliar to the English capital:  The place from which the shop front has been taken makes a gay proscenium; as I sit and smoke, the street becomes a stage, with an endless procession of lively actors crossing and re-crossing. Women with children, carts and coaches, men on horseback, soldiers, water-carriers with their pails, family groups, more soldiers, lounging ex quisites, more family groups (coming past, flushed, a little late for the play). . . . We are all amused, sitting seeing the traffic in the street, and the traffic in the street is in its turn amused by seeing us (“Railway Dreaming,” pp. 373-374).   Paris is a society of spectacle, a glamorous outdoor “stage” where citizens are both actors and audience. Later in the article, however, Dickens describes a more sinister aspect of this culture of display when he is jostled by the crowds at the Paris morgue, whose “bodies lie on inclined planes within a great glass window, as though Holbein should represent Death, in his grim Dance, keeping a shop, and displaying his goods like a Regent Street or boulevard linen-draper” (p. 375). Dickens is unnerved here, as he was at Horsemonger Lane, by a society that places no restraints on visibility, even to preserve the solemnity of the dead.  It is a short step in Dickens’s imagination from the peep-show atmosphere of the Paris morgue in 1856 to the ritual slaughter in the Place de la Révolution during Robespierre’s “Reign of Terror” of 1793-1794. A Tale of Two Cities shows the dark side of urban theatricality, that a public appetite for glamorous “show” can rapidly degenerate into an insatiable hunger for “scenes of horror and demoralization.” The essentially theatrical quality of Parisian social life produces a theatrical Revolution. At the revolutionary “trials” at the Hall of Examination, Madame Defarge, we are told, “clapped her hands as at a play.” There is something uniquely Parisian, too, in the spectacle of the liberation of the Bastille (with only seven prisoners inside) and in the rituals of the Terror itself, as the tumbrils roll daily to the guillotine watched by knitting ladies, who take up seats in their favored spots each morning as if at a sideshow or circus. As Dickens describes it, even the victims of the Terror cannot escape the theatrical atmosphere of the proceedings. Among the condemned, “there are some so heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as they have seen in theatres, and in pictures.” Contrast this with Charles Darnay, who, on trial for his life earlier in the novel, disdains “the play at the Old Bailey”: He “neither flinched from the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it.” Our hero disappoints us on occasion, but here, by resisting being converted into a spectacle, he defends the most important social principle of the novel: the dignity of the private citizen in the face of the howling mob.  Theatricality is not the monopoly of the Terror. As the scene of the royal procession at Versailles shows, public exhibition was a deep-grained aspect of French court culture that, when revolution came,  translated easily in the imagination from the palace to the public square:  Soon the large-faced King and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the shining Bull’s Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen, Long live everybody and everything . . . until he absolutely wept with sentiment (p. 172).   An aide to Thomas Jefferson (who served as ambassador to France from 1785 to 1789) saw in the King’s levée an “Oriental splendor and magnificence”; the wild geographical inaccuracy of the description only reinforces our sense of how deeply alien French court culture was to the emergent liberal Anglo-American sensibility. The grotesque pomp and negligence of the royals that Dickens describes might itself have represented sufficient justification for revolution, were it not for the mindless response of “the mender of roads,” a hapless would-be revolutionary who shows himself so susceptible to the glamour of court spectacle that he weeps and wishes long life to those very people he has sworn to destroy. The dangers of a society of spectacle are summed up in his response: Whether it is the court of Louis XVI or Robespierre’s revolutionary committee, no government that asserts its power in the form of public exhibition can guarantee control of its audience’s reaction. The irrational fervor inspired by spectacle may distract the people from ideology, as it does the mender of roads at Versailles, who is disarmed by “sentiment”; but spectacle may just as easily produce the murderous revolutionary dance of the carmagnole, and the tumbrils that bring everyone—Louis and Robespierre, royals and revolutionaries alike—before the indiscriminate justice of the guillotine.  A tale of two fundamentally different cities, then? Given Dickens’s fascination with mob violence, it is not surprising that his only other historical novel, Barnaby Rudge (1841), describes the most significant popular uprising in London’s history, the anti-Catholic Gordon Riots of 1780, during which mobs roamed the streets for three days and  ransacked Parliament. Nevertheless, the fact that Dickens needed to draw on events from the prerevolutionary era (and that the protest itself fizzled) suggests that the Gordon Riots are the exception proving the rule for the history of English civil unrest. Dickens’s London, with its bad weather in place of sunny boulevards, and private clubs instead of cafés, does not possess the physical or cultural conditions for successful revolt. Mobs form in London in A Tale of Two Cities —at Darnay’s trial, and the burial of Roger Cly—but just as quickly melt away.  But the society of spectacle has a second, more sinister aspect from which England is not immune: paranoia. Dickens in Paris watching the passing crowds, who in turn watch him, might pass for a harmless afternoon’s entertainment in the city, but when the opportunity for seeing and being seen is hardened to an expectation, or even a right to total visibility, it is a short distance to paranoia and a culture obsessed with secrets. When there is no escape from the social gaze, voyeurs quickly turn into spies and informants, and the least assertion of individuality or privacy is interpreted as a guilty secret that needs to be exposed.  Dickens reminds his readers that “our English reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern date,” and looks back in the novel to a time when the governments of both France and England were fully closed, decision-making structures, dependent on an invisible trade in secrets in their dealings both with each other and with their own citizens. We are introduced to this paranoid world from the novel’s first pages, in which Dickens powerfully creates a mood of secrecy, intrigue, and fear of exposure that feeds the atmosphere of almost every scene that follows: “The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses” (p. 12). In the mail coach sits one of our principal characters, Mr. Lorry of Tellson’s Bank (itself a repository of many secrets), on a clandestine mission whose purpose he will not divulge “anywhere or in any way,” except to trusty Jerry Cruncher in the form of a single, enigmatic phrase: “Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even Tellson’s, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of the matter. I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring to it. This is a secret service altogether. My credentials, entries, and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, ‘Re called to Life’ ” (pp. 29-30). Mr. Lorry’s cautiousness is no fictional fancy. In the late-eighteenth century, interception of the mail by government agents was “nearly universal.” The London Public Record Office alone possesses more than two dozen volumes of intercepted dispatches for the years 1756 to 1763, while in France, surveillance was almost total: The notorious cabinet noir read all letters sent abroad through the French post (Neilson, Go Spy the Land , p. 101).  Even the background canvas of Dover is gloomy with secret business conducted in the dead of night: “A little fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by night, and looking seaward. . . . Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter” (p. 23). Spies, smugglers, pirates. And Dickens himself gets in on the act. The opening scenes of his novel take the form of a secret, a mystery revealed with almost unbearable slowness, the story of Mr. Lorry’s client who has been unjustly imprisoned in the Bastille for eighteen years, and who is now to be reunited with his daughter.  Later, outside the Old Bailey, we witness a public manifestation of informer culture as extraordinary to Dickens’s contemporary readers as it is to us—the funeral procession of Roger Cly:  The crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were considered essential to the dignity of the position. The position appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and incessantly groaning and calling out: “Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!” with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat. . . .  “What is it, brother? What’s it about?”  “ I don’t know,” said the man. “Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!”  He asked another man. “Who is it?”  “ I don’t know,” returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest ardour, “Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi-ies!” (p. 155).   It is a typical Dickensian crowd, its passion directly proportional to its stupidity. Here they are duped entirely (Roger Cly lives!), but that such a crowd might be whipped up to mock a dead government agent signifies a state intelligence apparatus that is as ubiquitous and unpopular as it is incompetent. These are not the spies of John le Carré, let alone Ian Fleming, and A Tale of Two Cities is the more historically credible for that. Secret agents in the late-eighteenth century were mostly grasping mercenaries drawn from the criminal classes. “There were few Nathan Hales,” one historian records, and “for the most part it remained a venal business” ( Go Spy the Land , p. 110).  But it is Paris, not London, that is most infested with spies. Dickens drew much historical detail for the Paris sections of the novel from Louis-Sébastien Mercier’s twelve-volume Le Tableau de Paris (1781-1788). In an essay entitled “Spies,” Mercier describes how, in the 1780s “the Parisian . . . was surrounded . . . by spies . . . it was the universal means of gathering secrets for the efficient use of the ministers.” Historians’ estimates for the numbers of government agents in Paris alone range up to three thousand. And as Barsad’s unsuccessful infiltration of Saint-Antoine shows, Parisians were equally on their guard against foreign spies. The atmosphere in the Defarges’ wine-shop when Barsad drops in reads like the script for a thousand twentieth-century films noir: “A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she felt to be a new one. She laid down her knitting, and began to pin her rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure. It was curious. The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the wine-shop” (p. 179).  By the time Charles Darnay travels into revolutionary France, the atmosphere of deadly intrigue at the Saint-Antoine wine-shop has expanded to comprehend the entire country and its governance. The Revolutionary Convention has enacted its infamous Law of Suspects (September 1793), by which anyone might be accused by anyone, and now wields “universal watchfulness” as its supreme weapon of terror and control:  The universal watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken in a net, or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone.  This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge (p. 245).   Darnay is in France to repudiate a lettre de cachet —a form of anonymous indictment admissible in French courts—brought against the manager of his former estate. But the sublime prosecutorial power of “universal watchfulness” means that he will do no better than join his man in the Bastille. There, of course, he will find more spies, the so-called “sheep of the prisons,” whose existence points to the paranoid extremes of government surveillance during the Terror. Even those already condemned to death aren’t safe from its harassing gaze.  The principal victim of state secrecy in the novel is not, of course, Darnay or Gabelle, but Doctor Manette. The French term for solitary confinement, en secret (the title of the opening chapter of the third book), defines not merely the physical nature of Manette’s incarceration but its systemic meaning. When Dickens traveled abroad in 1842, he found to his horror that this sinister tradition of the ancien régime was being continued where he least expected to find it: in the cradle of American democracy, Philadelphia. Dickens was no bleeding heart when it came to the routine brutalization of inmates in nineteenth-century prisons; but the practice of solitary confinement tapped the deep wellsprings of his imaginative sympathy. His visit to the Philadelphia state prison is the most passionately rendered episode in his American Notes :  Over the head and face of every prisoner who comes into this melancholy house, a black hood is drawn; and in this dark shroud, an emblem of the curtain dropped between him and the living world, he is led to the cell from which he never again comes forth, until his whole term of imprisonment has expired. He never hears of wife or children; home or friends; the life or death of any single creature. He sees the prison officers, but with that exception he never looks upon a human countenance, or hears a human voice. He is a man buried alive; to be dug out in the slow round of years; and in the mean time dead to everything but torturing anxieties and horrible despair (p. 69).   Here is the seed, almost two decades in germination, for Doctor Manette and A Tale of Two Cities (and its preliminary title, Buried Alive ). While some of the scenes and characters of the novel creak with age, and read to us as stock melodrama, Dickens’s rendering of the effects of psychological torture on Doctor Manette is a terrific achievement, his use of the eighteenth-century associationist language of philosophers John Locke and David Hartley more subtle and gripping than a library’s worth of post-Freudian case studies. The effects of punitive isolation on the prisoner are so complete that he no longer knows his own name:  “Did you ask me for my name?”  “Assuredly I did.”  “One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”  “Is that all?”  “One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”  With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work again, until the silence was again broken.  “You are not a shoemaker by trade?” said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly at him. . . .  He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his hands the whole time. His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a subject of last night.  “I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after a long while, and I have made shoes ever since” (p. 45).   The Doctor’s making and mending of shoes (another detail borrowed from the Philadelphia prison) takes the place of rage and remembering. This therapeutic act, ceaselessly repeated, transforms the angry young inmate who pronounced a curse on the heads of the Darnay family into the gentle old man his daughter finds above the wine-shop in Saint Antoine, and ultimately into a hero of humane charity in the killing fields of the Revolution.  For Doctor Manette, the love of family is the cure for the cruel effects of state secrecy. In the politics of A Tale of Two Cities , however, it is also the best means of preventing the tyranny of state surveillance in  the first place. Paradoxically, Dickens’s argument against the police state proceeds from a meditation on “secrecy” itself: not the manufacture of secrets by a paranoid government, but the secret at the core of human personality, the essential privacy of the individual that it is the duty of the modern, liberal state to protect. To make this key point, Dickens stands back from his narrative at the beginning of chapter 3, and speaks in his own voice:  A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! . . . My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was al ways in that individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life’s end (p. 16).   This is a metaphysics of secrecy, a philosophical affirmation of what we might call “the right to privacy.” It is consecrated by the private, wholly nontheatrical marriage of the hero and heroine in Soho, “in a neighbouring church, where no strange eyes looked on,” and it opens up the positive social vision in the novel.  Dickens’s urban social ideal—for a society made up of private families, unharassed by mob or state—glows most sentimentally in A Christmas Carol . The struggling Cratchits serve as Dickens’s essential social unit: a Victorian family gathered together around the hearth, a charmed circle of retreat that is sanctuary against the humiliation and injustice heaped on its individual members in the harsh world “out there.” In this overfamiliar story, Scrooge dominates the public world of “business” but has rejected family ties. He can only look in on the happy Cratchits from their threshold, first in wonder, then in a mortification of envy and regret.  In A Tale of Two Cities , the role of the Cratchits is played by the Manettes and their friends, the battered but unbroken community that reclaims its head from the dungeons of the French police state,  and retreats to its quiet suburban idyll at the northern outskirts of London: “a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets” (p. 94). The miniature social order they reconstitute for themselves in Soho is a kind of benign matriarchy, presided over by the heroine, Lucie Manette: “Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of years” (p. 207). Lucie embodies the miracle of domestic life: that its binding force is greater than the sum power of its individual members. Her love for her family is a self-replenishing energy, satisfying all as it sustains her:  many times her father had told her that he found her more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and . . . many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her “What is the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us, as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to have too much to do?” (p. 210).   This benevolent example extends to Miss Pross, a servant elevated to “companion” who eats with the family on Sundays and, in her devotion to her employers, reminds Mr. Lorry “that there is nothing in it [the world] better than the faithful service of the heart; so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint” (p. 98). This relationship between the classes in the Soho household is the real English guarantee against revolution. It is a fictional construction of the social goal Dickens once described to the Administrative Reform Association, one of the many liberal bodies he addressed in his career as all-purpose public advocate: “It is stated that this Association sets class against class. Is this so? No, it finds class set against class, and seeks to reconcile them” ( Speeches , p. 203).  But the Manettes’ trials have only just begun. While Lucie, surely Dickens’s blandest angel of goodness, directs the process of family healing from her “tranquil” corner of London, in the opposite corner, the Faubourg Saint-Antoine in Paris, stands the unforgettable  Madame Defarge, English fiction’s matriarch of horror. The single encounter between the two women is one of the most hair-raising episodes in the novel:  “Is that his child?” said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it were the finger of Fate.  “Yes, madame,” answered Mr. Lorry; “this is our poor prisoner’s darling daughter, and only child.”  The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child (p. 266).   Madame Defarge, is a supreme Dickens creation, often likened to Lady Macbeth; but she outdoes even this daunting model with her diabolical mix of patient cunning and shocking malevolence. As with Dickens’s account of the Revolution in general, the Madame is more mythic than strictly historical. She is one of the Furies of Hell:  There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets. . . . imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class, opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely without pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of her.  It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her, that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and her prey, and as such had no right to live (pp. 358-359).   Liberty becomes a problematic ideology when it is embodied by a she-demon like Madame Defarge. She represents how apparently modern, progressive social forces of “liberation” can be hijacked by  primal energies of bloodlust and tribal revenge. To the early-twenty-first century reader, she is a chillingly familiar figure, a prototype for the warrior ideologues of our own history, from Pol Pot to Osama Bin Laden: Unappeasable and merciless, her response to legitimate grievance is an entirely illegitimate appetite for blood and destruction. Even when the devastating crimes wrought on her family by Charles Darnay’s uncle are revealed at the end of the novel, we cannot admire or pity her. Our knowledge of her suffering cannot erase the image of what she has allowed herself to become as a consequence, because we have, in the figure of Doctor Manette, an example of how the resentment of terrible wrongs may be conquered by strength of moral will.  The most deeply English character in the novel, its true Burkean patriot, is Miss Pross: “For gracious sake, don’t talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of that” (p.287). She does not speak French in Paris; instead she speaks English more emphatically. So it is given to Miss Pross as the personification of commonsense, conservative En glishness to vanquish the threat of French extremism embodied in Madame Defarge. Because of her heroic stand against the Terror Incarnate, Doctor Manette and his son-in-law are ultimately saved, and the family is reconstituted in the suburban bosom of Soho. This conventional comedic reunion, however, is not achieved without the sacrifice of one unofficial member of the Manette family.  Which brings us to Sydney Carton, the black sheep of the Soho circle. Carton is one of Dickens’s prize delinquents, an enigmatic, ironical, and darkly appealing character to whom he gives the novel’s final words, the most famous exit line in English fiction. For some, Carton’s instant redemption on the scaffold strains credibility. The substitution of one character for another under the guillotine was a stock plot twist in French Revolution melodramas; only Carton’s ringing words save the moment from bathos. But the logic of the substitution runs deeper. Carton is granted the novel’s defining moral act not because he is Darnay’s double, but because he is Dickens’s.  In his preface, Dickens reveals that he “first conceived the main idea of this story” while acting in Wilkie Collins’s 1857 melodrama, The Frozen Deep (which Dickens coauthored). The fact that Dickens played the role of Richard Wardour, who first swears enmity to his rival for the love of the heroine only to give up his life for him in the  end, strongly suggests that Dickens’s identification with Carton is at the heart of the novel. The question of why this is so remains, however, and the answer lies as deeply buried in Dickens’s psyche as Doctor Manette in the dungeons of the Bastille.  As his lifelong passion for amateur theatricals shows, novel writing was never enough for Charles Dickens. He began his career as a journalist writing sketches of city life, and he never gave up his role as an intimate commentator on the daily London scene. In 1850 he launched his own weekly magazine, Household Words ; the magazine’s name, drawn from Shakespeare’s Henry V (act 4, scene 3: “Then shall our names, / Familiar in his mouth as household words, / . . . Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb’red”) advertised Dickens’s ambition not merely for fame, but his need to belong quite literally to the household itself. Then, in 1858, he embarked on the last great installment of his public career, as a reader of his works before large audiences. Dickens’s public readings, begun only months before he started work on A Tale of Two Cities , were an entirely unprecedented cultural phenomenon, inaugurating our modern age of literary publicity. Dickens was sincerely surprised that the readings had the effect of increasing sales of his books; his real purpose is clear from his opening remarks to his audiences. He encouraged them that  if as he proceeded they should feel disposed to give expression to any little emotion awakened by the story, he begged they would do so in the most natural way possible, and without the least apprehension of disturbing him.—( laughter ). Nothing could be more agreeable to him than to receive any assurance that they were interested, and nothing could be more in accordance with his wishes than that they should make themselves as like as possible to a small group of friends assembled to hear a tale told, and that they should at once forget everything ceremonious or formal in the manner of their coming together.—( applause ) (Dexter, “For One Night Only: An Account of the Famous Readings”).   Dickens loved the theater, but he desires a nontheatrical atmosphere for his readings. He renounces spectacle in favor of intimacy: “a small group of friends assembled to hear a tale told.” He insists on informality, and welcomes “emotion.” In short, Dickens wants to be  family, just as Sydney Carton wants desperately to belong to the Manette household. Carton articulates this desire in a long, maudlin speech to Darnay in which he perhaps makes more sense as Dickens than he does as Sydney Carton: “If you could endure to have such a worthless fellow, and a fellow of such indifferent reputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might be permitted to come and go as a privileged person here” (p. 205). Reading Dickens’s own deep-driving need for love from his public into the novel, we understand the necessity of Sydney Carton’s going to the scaffold for Charles Darnay. After all, what wouldn’t Dickens do for his beloved readers?  Charles Dickens’s novels represented him, the popular author of his age, as the perfect mediator between the public world and the private sanctum of the family. His character-filled social panoramas granted him admission as a “privileged person” to the domestic arena idealized by the Victorians, as a benevolent emissary (never a spy) from the outside world, an educator and entertainer who takes his place at the fireside, informally and without ceremony. By this means, Dickens’s novels participated in that great reconciliation of the classes he looked to in his speech to the Administrative Reform Association. His social vision embraced multitudes; but instead of producing that vision theatrically, with theatricality’s ever-present potential for riots and rolling heads, he transmitted it in prose read by all levels of English society in unprecedented numbers. Dickens gave birth to that “privileged” medium of Victorian culture, the social novel: It promoted reflection and political reform, while recognizing, in the private act of reading, a solemn proof that “every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other.” Out of this recognition comes Dickens’s implicit argument for the natural limits of state power in A Tale of Two Cities , limits so grotesquely exceeded by the French nation both before their revolution, and during it.  \n\nGillen D’Arcy Wood was born in Australia, where he received a master’s degree in English and a diploma of music from Melbourne University, before moving to New York in 1992.

A strong desire was upon me then, to embody it in my own person; and I traced out in my fancy, the state of mind of which it would necessitate the presentation to an observant spectator, with particular care and interest.  As the idea became familiar to me, it gradually shaped itself into its present form. Throughout its execution, it has had complete possession of me; I have so far verified what is done and suffered in these pages, as that I have certainly done and suffered it all myself.  Whenever any reference (however slight) is made here to the condition of the French people before or during the Revolution, it is truly made, on the faith of the most trustworthy witnesses. It has been one of my hopes to add something to the popular and picturesque means of understanding that terrible time, though no one can hope to add anything to the philosophy of Mr. Carlyle’s wonderful book.  Tavistock House, London\nNovember, 1859 \n\n BOOK THE FIRST \n![004](bano_9781411433236_oeb_004_r1.jpg)\n Recalled to Life \n\n CHAPTER 1  The Period  I t was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.  There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.  It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.  France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands  cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.  In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of “the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles’s, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob; and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way.  In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer’s boy of sixpence.  All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures—the creatures of this chronicle among the rest—along the roads that lay before them. \n\n CHAPTER 2  The Mail  I t was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before the first of the persons with whom this historyhas business. The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter’s Hill. He walked up-hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combination, had read that article of war which forbad a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument,   that some brute animals are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty.  \n The Mail \n![005](bano_9781411433236_oeb_005_r1.jpg)\n With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary “Wo-ho! so-ho then!” the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it—like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.  There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all.  Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheek-bones and over the ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in “the Captain’s” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable nondescript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter’s Hill, as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass.  The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the journey.  “Wo-ho!” said the coachman. “So, then! One more pull and you’re at the top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to it!—Joe!”  “Halloa!” the guard replied.  “What o’clock do you make it, Joe?”  “Ten minutes, good, past eleven.”  “My blood!” ejaculated the vexed coachman, “and not atop of Shooter’s yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!”  The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative, made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman.  The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.  “Tst! Joe!” cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his box.  “What do you say, Tom?”  They both listened.  “I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.”  “ I say a horse at a gallop, Tom,” returned the guard, leaving his hold of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. “Gentlemen! In the king’s name, all of you!”  With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on the offensive.  The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in; the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of it; they remained in the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back, without contradicting.  The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.  The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.  “So-ho!” the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. “Yo there! Stand! I shall fire!”  The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering, a man’s voice called from the mist, “Is that the Dover mail?”  “Never you mind what it is!” the guard retorted. “What are you?”  “ Is that the Dover mail?”  “Why do you want to know?”  “I want a passenger, if it is.”  “What passenger?”  “Mr. Jarvis Lorry.”  Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. The guard, the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.  “Keep where you are,” the guard called to the voice in the mist, “because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in your lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.”  “What is the matter?” asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering speech. “Who wants me? Is it Jerry?”  (“I don’t like Jerry’s voice, if it is Jerry,” growled the guard to him self. “He’s hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.”)  “Yes, Mr. Lorry.”  “What is the matter?”  “A despatch sent you from over yonder. T. and Co.”  “I know this messenger, guard,” said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the road—assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and pulled up the window. “He may come close; there’s nothing wrong.”  “I hope there ain’t, but I can’t make so ’Nation sure of that,” said the guard, in gruff soliloquy. “Hallo you!”  “Well! And hallo you!” said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.  “Come on at a footpace! d’ye mind me? And if you’ve got holsters to that saddle o’ yourn, don’t let me see your hand go nigh ’em. For I’m a devil at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So now let’s look at you.”  The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist, and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The rider stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger a small folded paper. The rider’s horse was blown, and both horse and rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man.  “Guard!” said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.  The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman, answered curtly, “Sir.”  “There is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson’s Bank. You must know Tellson’s Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A crown to drink. I may read this?”  “If so be as you’re quick, sir.”  He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side and read—first to himself and then aloud: “ ‘Wait at Dover for Mam’selle.’ It’s not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED TO LIFE.”  Jerry started in his saddle. “That’s a Blazing strange answer, too,” said he, at his hoarsest.  “Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as well as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night.”  With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general pretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action.  The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt, looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a few smith’s tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw, and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in five minutes.  “Tom!” softly over the coach-roof.  “Hallo, Joe.”  “Did you hear the message?”  “I did, Joe.”  “What did you make of it, Tom?”  “Nothing at all, Joe.”  “That’s a coincidence, too,” the guard mused, “for I made the same of it myself.”  Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of holding about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the hill.  “After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won’t trust your fore-legs till I get you on the level,” said this hoarse messenger, glancing at his mare. “ ‘Recalled to life.’ That’s a Blazing strange message. Much of that wouldn’t do for you, Jerry! I say, Jerry! You’d be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion, Jerry!” \n\n CHAPTER 3  The Night Shadows  A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life’s end. In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?  As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail-coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the breadth of a county between him and the next.  The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together—as if they were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and throat, which descended nearly to the wearer’s knees. When he stopped for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he poured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he muffled again.  “No, Jerry, no!” said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rose. “It wouldn’t do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn’t suit your line of business! Recalled—! Bust me if I don’t think he’d been a drinking!”  His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several times, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown, which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was so like smith’s work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.  While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of Tellson’s Bank, by Temple Bar, who was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of her private topics of uneasiness. They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.  What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom, likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.  Tellson’s Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank passenger—with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger, and driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special jolt—nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great stroke of business. The rattle of the harness was the chink of money, and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson’s, with all its foreign and home connexion, ever paid in thrice the time. Then the strong-rooms underground, at Tellson’s, with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.  But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach (in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was always with him, there was another current of impression that never ceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one out of a grave.  Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed, and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt, defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another; so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands and figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was prematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spectre:  “Buried how long?”  The answer was always the same. “Almost eighteen years.”  “You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”  “Long ago.”  “You know that you are recalled to life?”  “They tell me so.”  “I hope you care to live?”  “I can’t say.”  “Shall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?”  The answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes the broken reply was, “Wait! It would kill me if I saw her too soon.” Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was “Take me to her.” Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it was, “I don’t know her. I don’t understand.”  After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig, and dig, dig—now, with a spade, now with a great key, now with his hands—to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fall away to dust. The passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek.  Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple-bar, the real business of the past day, the real strong-rooms, the real express sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. Out of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost it again.  “Buried how long?”  “Almost eighteen years.”  “I hope you care to live?”  “I can’t say.”  Dig—dig—dig—until an impatient movement from one of the two passengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two slumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again slid away into the bank and the grave.  “Buried how long?”  “Almost eighteen years.”  “You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”  “Long ago.”  The words were still in his hearing as just spoken—distinctly in his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life—when the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the shadows of the night were gone.  He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was a ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood, in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees.Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear, and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.  “Eighteen years!” said the passenger, looking at the sun. “Gracious Creator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!” \n\n CHAPTER 4  The Preparation  W hen the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon, the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his custom was. He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon.  By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left to be congratulated; for the two others had been set down at their respective roadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather like a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking him self out of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.  “There will be a packet to Calais, to-morrow, drawer?”  “Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. Bed, sir?”  “I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.”  “And then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please. Show Concord! Gentleman’s valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off gentleman’s boots in Concord. (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.) Fetch barber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!”  The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it, all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, another drawer, and two porters, and several maids, and the landlady, were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to his breakfast.  The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat, with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still, that he might have been sitting for his portrait.  Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waistcoat, as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass. His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings, was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A face, habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and reserved  expression of Tellson’s Bank. He had a healthy colour in his cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety. But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson’s Bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.  Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait, Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused him, and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:  “I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask for a gentleman from Tellson’s Bank. Please to let me know.”  “Yes, sir. Tellson’s Bank in London, sir?”  “Yes.”  “Yes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris, sir. A vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company’s House.”  “Yes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.”  “Yes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think, sir?”  “Not of late years. It is fifteen years since we—since I—came last from France.”  “Indeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people’s time here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir.”  “I believe so.”  “But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen years ago?”  “You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from the truth.”  “Indeed, sir!”  Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the table, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left, dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. According to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.  When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away  from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.  As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry’s thoughts seemed to cloud too. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging, digging, digging, in the live red coals.  A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work. Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street, and rumbled into the inn-yard.  He set down his glass untouched. “This is Mam’selle!” said he.  In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from Tellson’s.  “So soon?”  Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson’s immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.  The gentleman from Tellson’s had nothing left for it but to empty his glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen wig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette’s apartment. It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black  horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if they were buried, in deep graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out.  The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for the moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall candles, he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and the fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak, and still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon, in her hand. As his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth it was), of lifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions—as his eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him, of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran high. The likeness passed away, say, like a breath along the surface of the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine gender—and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.  “Pray take a seat, sir.” In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.  “I kiss your hand, miss,” said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.  “I received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that some intelligence—or discovery—”  “The word is not material, miss; either word will do.”  “—respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw—so long dead—”  Mr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the hospital procession of negro cupids. As if they had any help for anybody in their absurd baskets!  “—rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris; there to communicate with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for the purpose.”  “Myself.”  “As I was prepared to hear, sir.”  She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he was than she. He made her another bow.  “I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself, during the journey, under that worthy gentleman’s protection. The gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here.”  “I was happy,” said Mr. Lorry, “to be entrusted with the charge. I shall be more happy to execute it.”  “Sir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told me by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising nature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are.”  “Naturally,” said Mr. Lorry. “Yes—I—”  After a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the ears:  “It is very difficult to begin.”  He did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. The young forehead lifted itself into that singular expression—but it was pretty and characteristic, besides being singular—and she raised her hand, as if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed, some passing shadow.  “Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?”  “Am I not?” Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards with an argumentative smile.  Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair  by which she had hitherto remained standing. He watched her as she mused, and the moment she raised her eyes again, went on:  “In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you as a young English lady, Miss Manette?”  “If you please, sir.”  “Miss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to acquit myself of. In your reception of it, don’t heed me any more than if I was a speaking machine—truly, I am not much else. I will, with your leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.”  “Story!”  He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added, in a hurry, “Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call our connexion our customers. He was a French gentleman; a scientific gentleman; a man of great acquirements—a Doctor.”  “Not of Beauvais?”  “Why, yes, of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the gentleman was of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the gentleman was of repute in Paris. I had the honour of knowing him there. Our relations were business relations, but confidential. I was at that time in our French House, and had been—oh! twenty years.”  “At that time—I may ask, at what time, sir?”  “I speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He married—an English lady—and I was one of the trustees. His affairs, like the affairs of many other French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson’s hands. In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss; there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like sentiment. I have passed from one to another, in the course of my business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere machine. To go on—”  “But this is my father’s story, sir; and I begin to think”—the curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him—“that when I was left an orphan through my mother’s surviving my father only two years, it was you who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was you.”  Mr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced  to take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips. He then conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding the chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub his chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking down into her face while she sat looking up into his.  “Miss Manette, it was I. And you will see how truly I spoke of myself just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect that I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward of Tellson’s House since, and I have been busy with the other business of Tellson’s House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance of them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary Mangle.”  After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which was most unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before), and resumed his former attitude.  “So far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your regretted father. Now comes the difference. If your father had not died when he did—Don’t be frightened! How you start!”  She did, indeed, start. And she caught his wrist with both her hands.  “Pray,” said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped him in so violent a tremble: “pray control your agitation—a matter of business. As I was saying—”  Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began anew:  “As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had suddenly and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper, across the water, there; for instance, the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of him, and all quite in vain;—then the history of your father  would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.”  “I entreat you to tell me more, sir.”  “I will. I am going to. You can bear it?”  “I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment.”  “You speak collectedly, and you— are collected. That’s good!” (Though his manner was less satisfied than his words.) “A matter of business. Regard it as a matter of business—business that must be done. Now if this doctor’s wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit, had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was born—”  “The little child was a daughter, sir?”  “A daughter. A—a—matter of business—don’t be distressed. Miss, if the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born, that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by rearing her in the belief that her father was dead—No, don’t kneel! In Heaven’s name why should you kneel to me?”  “For the truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!”  “A—a matter of business. You confuse me, and how can I transact business if I am confused? Let us be clear-headed. If you could kindly mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. I should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind.”  Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had very gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she communicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.  “That’s right, that’s right. Courage! Business! You have business before you; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course with you. And when she died—I believe broken-hearted—having never slackened her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old, to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years.”  As he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on  the flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have been already tinged with grey.  “You know that your parents had no great possession, and that what they had was secured to your mother and to you. There has been no new discovery, of money, or of any other property; but—”  He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The expression in the forehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.  “But he has been—been found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is too probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best. Still, alive.Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.”  A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his. She said, in a low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in a dream,  “I am going to see his Ghost! It will be his Ghost—not him!”  Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. “There, there, there! See now, see now! The best and the worst are known to you, now.You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and, with a fair sea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his dear side.”  She repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, “I have been free, I have been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!”  “Only one thing more,” said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a wholesome means of enforcing her attention: “he has been found under another name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed. It would be worse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to know whether he has been for years overlooked, or al ways designedly held prisoner. It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries, because it would be dangerous. Better not to mention the subject, anywhere or in any way, and to remove him—for a while at all events—out of France. Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even Tellson’s, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of the matter. I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring to it. This is a secret service altogether. My credentials, entries, and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, ‘Recalled to Life’; which may mean anything. But what is the matter? She doesn’t notice a word! Miss Manette!”  Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she sat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed upon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or branded into her forehead. So close was her hold upon his arm, that he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving.  A wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry observed to be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed in some extraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her head a most wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good measure too, or a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in advance of the inn servants, and soon settled the question of his detachment from the poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his chest, and sending him flying back against the nearest wall.  (“I really think this must be a man!” was Mr. Lorry’s breathless reflection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall.)  “Why, look at you all!” bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants. “Why don’t you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring at me? I am not so much to look at, am I? Why don’t you go and fetch things? I’ll let you know, if you don’t bring smelling-salts, cold water, and vinegar, quick, I will.”  There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she softly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and gentleness: calling her “my precious!” and “my bird!” and spreading her golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.  “And you in brown!” she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry; “couldn’t you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do you call that being a Banker?”  Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to answer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn servants under the mysterious penalty of “letting them know” something not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head upon her shoulder.  “I hope she will do well now,” said Mr. Lorry.  “No thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!”  “I hope,” said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility, “that you accompany Miss Manette to France?”  “A likely thing, too!” replied the strong woman. “If it was ever intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an island?”  This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to consider it. \n\n CHAPTER 5  The Wine-shop  A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street.  The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.  All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women’s heads, which were squeezed dry into infants’ mouths; others made small mud embankments, to stem the wine as it ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off little streams of  wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence.  A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices—voices of men, women, and children—resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths, shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in motion again; the woman who had left on a door-step the little pot of hot-ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into the winter light from cellars, moved away to descend again; and a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.  The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again. Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his head more out of a long squalid bag of a night-cap than in it, scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees—BLOOD.  The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on  the street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.  And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was heavy—cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in waiting on the saintly presence—nobles of great power all of them; but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and re-grinding in the mill, and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner, passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh, was the sign, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal, among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the baker’s shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomies in every farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant drops of oil.  Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost  as many as the shops) were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops, croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler’s knives and axes were sharp and bright, the smith’s hammers were heavy, and the gunmaker’s stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement, with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down the middle of the street—when it ran at all: which was only after heavy rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted, and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.  For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their condition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of song and feather, took no warning.  The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle for the lost wine. “It’s not my affair,” said he, with a final shrug of the shoulders. “The people from the market did it. Let them bring another.”  There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke, he called to him across the way:  “Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?”  The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often the way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is often the way with his tribe too.  “What now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?” said the  wine-shop keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. “Why do you write in the public streets? Is there—tell me thou—is there no other place to write such words in?”  In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally, perhaps not) upon the joker’s heart. The joker rapped it with his own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his hand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.  “Put it on, put it on,” said the other. “Call wine, wine; and finish there.” With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker’s dress, such as it was—quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on his account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.  This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty, and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder. His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to the elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own crisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man altogether, with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them. Good-humoured-looking on the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing down a narrow path with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn the man.  Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he came in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported by her left hand,  Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but coughed just one grain of cough. This, in combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look around the shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way.  The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in a corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply of wine. As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, “This is our man.”  “What the devil do you do in that galley there?” said Monsieur Defarge to himself; “I don’t know you.”  But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.  “How goes it, Jacques?” said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. “Is all the spilt wine swallowed?”  “Every drop, Jacques,” answered Monsieur Defarge.  When this interchange of christian name was effected, Madame Defarge, picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.  “It is not often,” said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur Defarge, “that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?”  “It is so, Jacques,” Monsieur Defarge returned.  At this second interchange of the christian name, Madame Defarge, still using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.  The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty drinking vessel and smacked his lips.  “Ah! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I right, Jacques?”  “You are right, Jacques,” was the response of Monsieur Defarge.  This third interchange of the christian name was completed at the moment when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and slightly rustled in her seat.  “Hold then! True!” muttered her husband. “Gentlemen—my wife!”  The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three flourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner round the wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit, and became absorbed in it.  “Gentlemen,” said her husband, who had kept his bright eye obser vantly upon her, “good day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the fifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little court-yard close to the left here,” pointing with his hand, “near to the window of my establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been there, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!”  They paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.  “Willingly, sir,” said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to the door.  Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.  Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus, joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his other company just before. It opened from a stinking little black court-yard, and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. It was a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds. He  had no good-humour in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret, angry, dangerous man.  “It is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly.” Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began ascending the stairs.  “Is he alone?” the latter whispered.  “Alone! God help him, who should be with him?” said the other, in the same low voice.  “Is he always alone, then?”  “Yes.”  “Of his own desire?”  “Of his own necessity. As he was, when I first saw him after they found me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril, be discreet—as he was then, so he is now.”  “He is greatly changed?”  “Changed!”  The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand, and mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half so forcible. Mr. Lorry’s spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his two companions ascended higher and higher.  Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation within the great foul nest of one high building—that is to say, the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircase—left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides flinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted the air, even if poverty and deprivation has not loaded it with their intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison, the way lay.Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to his young companion’s agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr. Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in. Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and  nothing within range, nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.  At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the third time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story was reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over his shoulder, took out a key.  “The door is locked then, my friend?” said Mr. Lorry, surprised.  “Ay. Yes,” was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.  “You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?”  “I think it necessary to turn the key.” Monsieur Defarge whispered it closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.  “Why?”  “Why! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be frightened—rave—tear himself to pieces—die—come to I know not what harm—if his door was left open.”  “Is it possible?” exclaimed Mr. Lorry.  “Is it possible?” repeated Defarge, bitterly. “Yes. And a beautiful world we live in, when it is possible, and when many other such things are possible, and not only possible, but done—done, see you!—under that sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on.”  This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word of it had reached the young lady’s ears. But, by this time she trembled under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety, and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.  “Courage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then, all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you bring to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side. That’s well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!”  They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came  all at once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wine-shop.  “I forgot them in the surprise of your visit,” explained Monsieur Defarge. “Leave us, good boys; we have business here.”  The three glided by, and went silently down.  There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr. Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:  “Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?”  “I show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.”  “Is that well?”  “ I think it is well.”  “Who are the few? How do you choose them?”  “I choose them as real men, of my name—Jacques is my name—to whom the sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.”  With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck twice or thrice upon the door—evidently with no other object than to make a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key across it, three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned it as heavily as he could.  The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the room and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.  He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr. Lorry got his arm securely round the daughter’s waist, and held her; for he felt that she was sinking.  “A—a—a—business, business!” he urged, with a moisture that was not of business shining on his cheek. “Come in, come in!”  “I am afraid of it,” she answered, shuddering.  “Of it? What?”  “I mean of him. Of my father.”  Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He set her down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.  Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside, took out the key again, and held it in his hand. All this he did, methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he could make. Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.  The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth the roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any other door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of this door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way. Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity.Yet, work of that kind was being done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes. \n\n CHAPTER 6  The Shoemaker  “ G oodday!” said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking.  It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the salutation, as if it were at a distance:  “Good day!”  “You are still hard at work, I see?”  After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and    the voice replied, “Yes—I am working.” This time, a pair of haggard eyes had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.  \n The Shoemaker \n![006](bano_9781411433236_oeb_006_r1.jpg)\n The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller, wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.  Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were aware of had stood, was not yet empty.  “I want,” said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker, “to let in a little more light here. You can bear a little more?”  The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening, at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.  “What did you say?”  “You can bear a little more light?”  “I must bear it, if you let it in.” (Laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word.)  The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that angle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so. His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body to be withered and worn. He, and his  old canvas frock, and his loose stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.  He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones of it seemed transparent. So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze, pausing in his work. He never looked at the figure before him, without first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.  “Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?” asked Defarge, motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.  “What did you say?”  “Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?”  “I can’t say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don’t know.”  But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again.  Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. When he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. The look and the action had occupied but an instant.  “You have a visitor, you see,” said Monsieur Defarge.  “What did you say?”  “Here is a visitor.”  The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his work.  “Come!” said Defarge. “Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when he sees one. Show him that shoe you are working at. Take it, monsieur.”  Mr. Lorry took it in his hand.  “Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker’s name.”  There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:  “I forgot what it was you asked me. What did you say?”  “I said, couldn’t you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur’s information?”  “It is a lady’s shoe. It is a young lady’s walking-shoe. It is in the present mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand.” He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.  “And the maker’s name?” said Defarge.  Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and so on in regular changes, without a moment’s intermission. The task of recalling him from the vacancy into which he always sank when he had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a fast-dying man.  “Did you ask me for my name?”  “Assuredly I did.”  “One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”  “Is that all?”  “One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”  With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work again, until the silence was again broken.  “You are not a shoemaker by trade?” said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly at him.  His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the question to him; but as no help came from that quarter, they turned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground.  “I am not a shoemaker by trade? No, I was not a shoemaker by trade. I—I learnt it here. I taught myself. I asked leave to—”  He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his hands the whole time. His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a subject of last night.  “I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after a long while, and I have made shoes ever since.”  As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him, Mr. Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in his face:  “Monsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?”  The shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking fixedly at the questioner.  “Monsieur Manette,” Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge’s arm; “do you remember nothing of this man? Look at him. Look at me. Is there no old banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your mind, Monsieur Manette?”  As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr. Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him, trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast, and love it back to life and hope—so exactly was the expression repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.  Darkness had fallen on him in its place. He looked at the two, less and less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way. Finally, with a deep long sigh, he took the shoe up, and resumed his work.  “Have you recognised him, monsieur?” asked Defarge in a whisper.  “Yes; for a moment. At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so well. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush!”  She had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on which he sat. There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped over his labour.  Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made. She stood, like a spirit, beside him, and he bent over his work.  It happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument in his hand, for his shoemaker’s knife. It lay on that side of him  which was not the side on which she stood. He had taken it up, and was stooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress. He raised them, and saw her face. The two spectators started forward, but she stayed them with a motion of her hand. She had no fear of his striking at her with the knife, though they had.  He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. By degrees, in the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard to say:  “What is this?”  With the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to her lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if she laid his ruined head there.  “You are not the gaoler’s daughter?”  She sighed “No.”  “Who are you?”  Not yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench beside him. He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm. A strange thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he laid the knife down softly, as he sat staring at her.  Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed aside, and fell down over her neck. Advancing his hand by little and little, he took it up and looked at it. In the midst of the action he went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his shoemaking.  But not for long. Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his shoulder. After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to be sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached to it. He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden hairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger.  He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it. “It is the same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!”  As the concentrating expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too. He turned her full to the light, and looked at her.  “She had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was  summoned out—she had a fear of my going, though I had none—and when I was brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve. ‘You will leave me them? They can never help me to escape in the body, though they may in the spirit.’ Those were the words I said. I remember them very well.”  He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it. But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him coherently, though slowly.  “How was this?— Was it you? ”  Once more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with a frightful suddenness. But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only said, in a low voice, “I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near us, do not speak, do not move!”  “Hark!” he exclaimed. “Whose voice was that?”  His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his white hair, which they tore in a frenzy. It died out, as everything but his shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and tried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and gloomily shook his head.  “No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It can’t be. See what the prisoner is. These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard. No, no. She was—and He was—before the slow years of the North Tower—ages ago. What is your name, my gentle angel?”  Hailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her knees before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.  “O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was, and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history. But I cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All that I may tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless me. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!”  His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed and lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him.  “If you hear in my voice—I don’t know that it is so, but I hope it is—if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you touch, in touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay in your breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! If,  when I hint to you of a Home there is before us, where I will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away, weep for it, weep for it!”  She held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast like a child.  “If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste, and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! And if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living, and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my honoured father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it! Weep for her, then, and for me! Good gentlemen, thank God! I feel his sacred tears upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart. O, see! Thank God for us, thank God!”  He had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a sight so touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.  When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his heaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all storms—emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm called Life must hush at last—they came forward to raise the father and daughter from the ground. He had gradually dropped to the floor, and lay there in a lethargy, worn out. She had nestled down with him, that his head might lie upon her arm; and her hair drooping over him curtained him from the light.  “If, without disturbing him,” she said, raising her hand to Mr. Lorry as he stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose, “all could be arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the very door, he could be taken away—”  “But, consider. Is he fit for the journey?” asked Mr. Lorry. “More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to him.”  “It is true,” said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear.  “More than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of France. Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?”  “That’s business,” said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his methodical manners; “and if business is to be done, I had better do it.”  “Then be so kind,” urged Miss Manette, “as to leave us here. You see how composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me now. Why should you be? If you will lock the door to secure us from interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when you come back, as quiet as you leave him. In any case, I will take care of him until you return, and then we will remove him straight.”  Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and in favour of one of them remaining. But, as there were not only carriage and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed, for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away to do it.  Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down on the hard ground close at the father’s side, and watched him. The darkness deepened and deepened, as they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed through the chinks in the wall.  Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and meat, wine, and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put his provender, and the lamp he carried, on the shoemaker’s bench (there was nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry roused the captive, and assisted him to his feet.  No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind, in the scared blank wonder of his face. Whether he knew what had happened, whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he knew that he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved. They tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow to answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for the time to tamper with him no more. He had a wild, lost manner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his daughter’s voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.  In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on the cloak and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear. He readily responded to his daughter’s drawing her arm through his, and took—and kept—her hand in both his own.  They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp, Mr. Lorry closing the little procession. They had not traversed many steps of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof and round at the walls.  “You remember the place, my father? You remember coming up here?”  “What did you say?”  But, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer as if she had repeated it.  “Remember? No, I don’t remember. It was so very long ago.”  That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his prison to that house, was apparent to them. They heard him mutter, “One Hundred and Five, North Tower,” and when he looked about him, it evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed him. On their reaching the court-yard he instinctively altered his tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he dropped his daughter’s hand and clasped his head again.  No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the many windows; not even a chance passer-by was in the street. An unnatural silence and desertion reigned there. Only one soul was to be seen, and that was Madame Defarge—who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.  The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed him, when Mr. Lorry’s feet were arrested on the step by his asking, miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. Madame Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the court-yard. She quickly brought them down and handed them in;— and immediately afterwards leaned against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.  Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word “To the Barrier!” The postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble over-swinging lamps.  Under the over-swinging lamps—swinging ever brighter in the better streets, and ever dimmer in the worse—and by lighted shops, gay crowds, illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city gates. Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. “Your papers, travellers!” “See here then, Monsieur the Officer,” said Defarge, getting down, and taking him gravely apart, “these are the papers of monsieur inside, with the white head. They were consigned to me, with him, at the—” He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head. “It is well. Forward!” from the uniform. “Adieu!” from Defarge. And so, under a short grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the great grove of stars.  Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights: some, so remote from this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black. All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry—sitting opposite the buried man who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were for ever lost to him, and what were capable of restoration—the old inquiry:  “I hope you care to be recalled to life?”  And the old answer:  “I can’t say.”  \nTHE END OF THE FIRST BOOK \n\n BOOK THE SECOND \n![007](bano_9781411433236_oeb_007_r1.jpg)\n The Golden Thread \n\n CHAPTER 1  Five Years Later  T ellson’s Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place, moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness, proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This was no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business. Tellson’s (they said) wanted no elbow-room, Tellson’s wanted no light, Tellson’s wanted no embellishment. Noakes and Co.’s might, or Snooks Brothers’ might; but Tellson’s, thank Heaven!—  Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding Tellson’s. In this respect the House was much on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable, but were only the more respectable.  Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson’s was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson’s down two steps, and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street, and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing “the House,” you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back, where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their parchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of Abyssinia or Ashantee.  But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson’s. Death is Nature’s remedy for all things, and why not Legislation’s? Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the pur loiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder of a horse at Tellson’s door, who made off with it, was put to Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to Death. Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention—it might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse—but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after. Thus, Tellson’s, in its day, like greater places of business, its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.  Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson’s, the oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a young man into Tellson’s London house, they hid him somewhere till he was old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had  the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he permitted to be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.  Outside Tellson’s—never by any means in it, unless called in—was an odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live sign of the house. He was never absent during business hours, unless upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that Tellson’s, in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted this person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the easterly parish church of Houndsditch, he had received the added appellation of Jerry.  The scene was Mr. Cruncher’s private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley, Whitefriars; the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. (Mr. Cruncher himself always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it.)  Mr. Cruncher’s apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it might be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early as it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay a-bed was already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth was spread.  Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin at home. At first, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky hair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons. At which juncture, he exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:  “Bust me, if she ain’t at it agin!”  A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a corner, with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the person referred to.  “What!” said Mr. Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot. “You’re at it agin, are you?”  After hailing the morn with this second salutation, he threw a boot at the woman as a third. It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce the odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher’s domestic economy, that, whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.  “What,” said Mr. Cruncher, varying his apostrophe after missing his mark—“what are you up to, Aggerawayter?”  “I was only saying my prayers.”  “Saying your prayers! You’re a nice woman! What do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me?”  “I was not praying against you; I was praying for you.”  “You weren’t. And if you were, I won’t be took the liberty with. Here! your mother’s a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin your father’s prosperity. You’ve got a dutiful mother, you have, my son. You’ve got a religious mother, you have, my boy: going and flopping herself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out of the mouth of her only child.”  Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning to his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal board.  “And what do you suppose, you conceited female,” said Mr. Cruncher, with unconscious inconsistency, “that the worth of your prayers may be? Name the price that you put your prayers at!”  “They only come from the heart, Jerry. They are worth no more than that.”  “Worth no more than that,” repeated Mr. Cruncher. “They ain’t worth much, then. Whether or no, I won’t be prayed agin, I tell you. I can’t afford it. I’m not a going to be made unlucky by your sneaking. If you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and child, and not in opposition to ’em. If I had had any but a unnat’ral wife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat’ral mother, I might had made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck. B-u-u-ust me!” said Mr. Cruncher, who all this time had been putting on his clothes, “if I ain’t, what with piety and one  blowed thing and another, been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor devil of a honest tradesman met with! Young Jerry, dress yourself, my boy, and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then, and if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call. For, I tell you,” here he addressed his wife once more, “I won’t be gone agin, in this manner. I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I’m as sleepy as laudanum, my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn’t know, if it wasn’t for the pain in ’em, which was me and which somebody else, yet I’m none the better for it in pocket; and it’s my suspicion that you’ve been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for it in pocket, and I won’t put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you say now!”  Growling, in addition, such phrases as “Ah! yes! You’re religious, too. You wouldn’t put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child, would you? Not you!” and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr. Cruncher betook himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparations for business. In the mean time, his son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes, and whose young eyes stood close by one another, as his father’s did, kept the required watch upon his mother. He greatly disturbed that poor woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping closet, where he made his toilet, with a suppressed cry of “You are going to flop, mother.—Halloa, father!” and, after raising this fictitious alarm, darting in again with an undutiful grin.  Mr. Cruncher’s temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast. He resented Mrs. Cruncher’s saying grace with particular animosity.  “Now, Aggerawayter! What are you up to? At it agin?”  His wife explained that she had merely “asked a blessing.”  “Don’t do it!” said Mr. Cruncher, looking about, as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife’s petitions. “I ain’t a going to be blest out of house and home. I won’t have my wittles blest off my table. Keep still!”  Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a party which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher worried his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any fourfooted  inmate of a menagerie. Towards nine o’clock he smoothed his ruffled aspect, and, presenting as respectful and business-like an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation of the day.  It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite description of himself as “a honest tradesman.” His stock consisted of a wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool, young Jerry, walking at his father’s side, carried every morning to beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where, with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man’s feet, it formed the encampment for the day. On this post of his, Mr. Cruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar itself,—and was almost as ill-looking.  Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson’s, Jerry took up his station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose. Father and son, extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys. The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else in Fleet-street.  The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson’s establishment was put through the door, and the word was given.  “Porter wanted!”  “Hooray, father! Here’s an early job to begin with!”  Having thus given his parent God speed, young Jerry seated him self on the stool, entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father had been chewing, and cogitated.  “Al-ways rusty! His fingers is al-ways rusty!” muttered young Jerry. “Where does my father get all that iron rust from? He don’t get no iron rust here!” \n\n CHAPTER 2  A Sight  “ Y ou know the Old Bailey well, no doubt?” said one of the oldest of clerks to Jerry the messenger.  “Ye-es, sir,” returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. “I do know the Bailey.”  “Just so. And you know Mr. Lorry.”  “I know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey. Much better,” said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment in question, “than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey.”  “Very well. Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He will then let you in.”  “Into the court, sir?”  “Into the court.”  Mr. Cruncher’s eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to interchange the inquiry, “What do you think of this?”  “Am I to wait in the court, sir?” he asked, as the result of that conference.  “I am going to tell you. The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr. Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry’s attention, and show him where you stand. Then what you have to do, is, to remain there until he wants you.”  “Is that all, sir?”  “That’s all. He wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to tell him you are there.”  As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note, Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence until he came to the blotting-paper stage, remarked:  “I suppose they’ll be trying Forgeries this morning?”  “Treason!”  “That’s quartering,” said Jerry. “Barbarous!”  “It is the law,” remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised spectacles upon him. “It is the law.”  “It’s hard in the law to spile a man, I think. It’s hard enough to kill him, but it’s wery hard to spile him, sir.”  “Not at all,” returned the ancient clerk. “Speak well of the law. Take care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take care of itself. I give you that advice.”  “It’s the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice,” said Jerry. “I leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.”  “Well, well,” said the old clerk; “we all have our various ways of gaining a livelihood. Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry ways. Here is the letter. Go along.”  Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal deference than he made an outward show of, “You are a lean old one, too,” made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination, and went his way.  They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it. But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench. It had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoner’s, and even died before him. For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard, from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any. So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning. It was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed under Heaven.  Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice illustration of the precept, that “Whatever is is right;” an aphorism that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.  Making his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to make his way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and handed in his letter through a trap in it. For people then paid to see the play at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam —only the former entertainment was much the dearer. Therefore, all the Old Bailey doors were well guarded—except, indeed, the social doors by which the criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.  After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into court.  “What’s on?” he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself next to.  “Nothing yet.”  “What’s coming on?”  “The Treason case.”  “The quartering one, eh?”  “Ah!” returned the man, with a relish; “he’ll be drawn on a hurdle to be half hanged, and then he’ll be taken down and sliced before his own face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on, and then his head will be chopped off, and he’ll be cut into quarters. That’s the sentence.”  “If he’s found Guilty, you mean to say?” Jerry added, by way of proviso.  “Oh! they’ll find him guilty,” said the other. “Don’t you be afraid of that.”  Mr. Cruncher’s attention was here diverted to the door-keeper, whom he saw making his way to Mr. Lorry, with the note in his hand. Mr. Lorry sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged gentleman, the prisoner’s counsel, who had a great bundle of papers before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher looked at him then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court. After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing with his hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had stood up to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again.  “What’s he got to do with the case?” asked the man he had spoken with.  “Blest if I know,” said Jerry.  “What have you got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?”  “Blest if I know that either,” said Jerry.  The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling down in the court, stopped the dialogue. Presently, the dock became the central point of interest. Two gaolers, who had been standing there, went out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar.  Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling, stared at him. All the human breath in the place, rolled at him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. Eager faces strained round pillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court, laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help themselves, at anybody’s cost, to a view of him—stood a-tiptoe, got upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him. Conspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not, that flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an impure mist and rain.  The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye. His condition was that of a young gentleman. He was plainly dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out of his way than for ornament. As an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the soul to be stronger than the sun. He was otherwise quite self-possessed, bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet.  The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at, was not a sort that elevated humanity. Had he stood in peril of a less horrible sentence—had there been a chance of any one of its savage details being spared—by just so much would he have lost in his fascination. The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled, was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and torn asunder, yielded the sensation. Whatever gloss the various spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and powers of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish.  Silence in the court! Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not Guilty to an indictment denouncing him (with infinite jingle and jangle) for that he was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his having, on divers occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted Lewis, the French King, in his wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions of our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of the said French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise evil-adverbiously, revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation to send to Canada and North America. This much, Jerry, with his head becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out with huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darney, stood there before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in; and that Mr. Attorney-General was making ready to speak.  The accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally hanged, beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it. He was quiet and attentive; watched the opening proceeding with a grave interest; and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which it was strewn. The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.  Over the prisoner’s head there was a mirror, to throw the light  down upon him. Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in it, and had passed from its surface and this earth’s together. Haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one day to give up its dead. Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner’s mind. Be that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious of a bar of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass his face flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away.  It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left. About on a level with his eyes, there sat, in that corner of the Judge’s bench, two persons upon whom his look immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his aspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him, turned to them.  The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair, and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind, but pondering and self-communing. When this expression was upon him, he looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken up—as it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter—he became a handsome man, not past the prime of life.  His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she sat by him, and the other pressed upon it. She had drawn close to him, in her dread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner. Her forehead had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion that saw nothing but the peril of the accused. This has been so very noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went about, “Who are they?”  Jerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his own manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his absorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. The crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got to Jerry:  “Witnesses.”  “For which side?”  “Against.”  “Against what side?”  “The prisoner’s.”  The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them, leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold. \n\n CHAPTER 3  A Disappointment  M r. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and repassing between France and England, on secret business of which he could give no honest account. That, if it were in the nature of traitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered. That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the prisoner’s schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his Majesty’s Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council. That this patriot would be produced before them. That, his position and attitude were, on the whole, sublime. That, he had been the prisoner’s friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country. That, if statues were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. That, as they were not so decreed,  he probably would not have one. That, Virtue, as had been observed by the poets (in many passages which he well knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues; whereat the jury’s countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that they knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country. That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had communicated itself to the prisoner’s servant, and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine his master’s table-drawers and pockets, and secrete his papers. That, he (Mr. Attorney-General) was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that, in a general way, he preferred him to his (Mr. Attorney-General’s) brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his (Mr. Attorney-General’s) father and mother. That, he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise. That, the evidence of these two witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of his Majesty’s forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed such information to a hostile power. That, these lists could not be proved to be in the prisoner’s handwriting; but that it was all the same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions. That, the proof would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans. That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they were), and being a responsible jury (as they knew they were), must positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him, whether they liked it or not. That, they never could lay their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon pillows at all, unless the prisoner’s head was taken off. That head Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of everything  he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as good as dead and gone.  When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in anticipation of what he was soon to become. When toned down again, the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.  Mr. Solicitor-General then, following his leader’s lead, examined the patriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name. The story of his pure soul was exactly what Mr. Attorney General had described it to be—perhaps, if it had a fault, a little too exactly. Having released his noble bosom of its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the wigged gentleman with the papers before him, sitting not far from Mr. Lorry, begged to ask him a few questions. The wigged gentleman sitting opposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court.  Had he ever been a spy himself? No, he scorned the base insinuation. What did he live upon? His property. Where was his property? He didn’t precisely remember where it was. What was it? No business of anybody’s. Had he inherited it? Yes, he had. From whom? Distant relation. Very distant? Rather. Ever been in prison? Certainly not. Never in a debtor’s prison? Didn’t see what that had to do with it. Never in a debtor’s prison?—Come, once again. Never? Yes. How many times? Two or three times. Not five or six? Perhaps. Of what profession? Gentleman. Ever been kicked? Might have been. Frequently? No. Ever kicked down stairs? Decidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell down-stairs of his own accord. Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice? Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who committed the assault, but it was not true. Swear it was not true? Positively. Ever live by cheating at play? Never. Ever live by play? Not more than other gentlemen do. Ever borrow money of the prisoner? Yes. Ever pay him? No. Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a very slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets? No. Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists? Certain. Knew no more about the lists? No. Had not procured them himself, for instance? No. Expect to get anything by this evidence? No. Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps? Oh dear no. Or to do anything? Oh dear no.  Swear that? Over and over again. No motives but motives of sheer patriotism? None whatever.  The virtuous servant, Roger Ciy, swore his way through the case at a great rate. He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and simplicity, four years ago. He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him. He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of charity—never thought of such a thing. He began to have suspicions of the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. In arranging his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the prisoner’s pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists from the drawer of the prisoner’s desk. He had not put them there first. He had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and Boulogne. He loved his country, and couldn’t bear it, and had given information. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot; he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be only a plated one. He had known the last witness seven or eight years; that was merely a coincidence. He didn’t call it a particularly curious coincidence; most coincidences were curious. Neither did he call it a curious coincidence that true patriotism was his only motive too. He was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.  The blue-flies buzzed again, and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr. Jarvis Lorry.  “Mr. Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellson’s bank?”  “I am.”  “On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, did business occasion you to travel between London and Dover by the mail?”  “It did.”  “Were there any other passengers in the mail?”  “Two.”  “Did they alight on the road in the course of the night?”  “They did.”  “Mr. Lorry, look upon the prisoner. Was he one of those two passengers?”  “I cannot undertake to say that he was.”  “Does he resemble either of these two passengers?”  “Both were so wrapped up, and the night was so dark, and we were all so reserved, that I cannot undertake to say even that.”  “Mr. Lorry, look again upon the prisoner. Supposing him wrapped up as those two passengers were, is there anything in his bulk and stature to render it unlikely that he was one of them?”  “No.”  “You will not swear, Mr. Lorry, that he was not one of them?”  “No.”  “So at least you say he may have been one of them?”  “Yes. Except that I remember them both to have been—like myself—timorous of highwaymen, and the prisoner has not a timorous air.”  “Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, Mr. Lorry?”  “I certainly have seen that.”  “Mr. Lorry, look once more upon the prisoner. Have you seen him, to your certain knowledge, before?”  “I have.”  “When?”  “I was returning from France a few days afterwards, and, at Calais, the prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned, and made the voyage with me.”  “At what hour did he come on board?”  “At a little after midnight.”  “In the dead of the night. Was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour?”  “He happened to be the only one.”  “Never mind about ‘happening,’ Mr. Lorry. He was the only passenger who came on board in the dead of the night?”  “He was.”  “Were you travelling alone, Mr. Lorry, or with any companion?”  “With two companions. A gentleman and lady. They are here.”  “They are here. Had you any conversation with the prisoner?”  “Hardly any. The weather was stormy, and the passage long and rough, and I lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore.”  “Miss Manette!”  The young lady, to whom all eyes had been turned before, and  were now turned again, stood up where she had sat. Her father rose with her, and kept her hand drawn through his arm.  “Miss Manette, look upon the prisoner.”  To be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty, was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd. Standing, as it were, apart with her on the edge of his grave, not all the staring curiosity that looked on, could, for the moment, nerve him to remain quite still. His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden; and his efforts to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour rushed to his heart. The buzz of the great flies was loud again.  “Miss Manette, have you seen the prisoner before?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Where?”  “On board of the packet-ship just now referred to, sir, and on the same occasion.”  “You are the young lady now referred to?”  “O! most unhappily, I am!”  The plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice of the Judge, as he said something fiercely: “Answer the questions put to you, and make no remark upon them.”  “Miss Manette, had you any conversation with the prisoner on that passage across the Channel?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Recall it.”  In the midst of a profound stillness, she faintly began:  “When the gentleman came on board—”  “Do you mean the prisoner?” inquired the Judge, knitting his brows.  “Yes, my Lord.”  “Then say the prisoner.”  “When the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father,” turning her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, “was much fatigued and in a very weak state of health. My father was so reduced, that I was afraid to take him out of the air, and I had made a bed for him on the deck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his side to take care of him. There were no other passengers that night, but  we four. The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could shelter my father from the wind and weather, better than I had done. I had not known how to do it well, not understanding how the wind would set when we were out of the harbour. He did it for me. He expressed great gentleness and kindness for my father’s state, and I am sure he felt it. That was the manner of our beginning to speak together.”  “Let me interrupt you for a moment. Had he come on board alone?”  “No.”  “How many were with him?”  “Two French gentlemen.”  “Had they conferred together?”  “They had conferred together until the last moment, when it was necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat.”  “Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?”  “Some papers had been handed about among them, but I don’t know what papers.”  “Like these in shape and size?”  “Possibly, but indeed I don’t know, although they stood whispering very near to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the light of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp, and they spoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw only that they looked at papers.”  “Now, to the prisoner’s conversation, Miss Manette.”  “The prisoner was as open in his confidence with me—which arose out of my helpless situation—as he was kind, and good, and useful to my father. I hope,” bursting into tears, “I may not repay him by doing him harm to-day.”  Buzzing from the blue-flies.  “Miss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that you give the evidence which it is your duty to give—which you must give—and which you cannot escape from giving—with great unwillingness, he is the only person present in that condition. Please to go on.”  “He told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and difficult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he was  therefore travelling under an assumed name. He said that this business had, within a few days, taken him to France, and might, at intervals, take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a long time to come.”  “Did he say anything about America, Miss Manette? Be particular.”  “He tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he said that, so far as he could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one on England’s part. He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the Third. But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said laughingly, and to beguile the time.”  Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be unconsciously imitated by the spectators. Her forehead was painfully anxious and intent as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when she stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon the Counsel for and against. Among the lookers-on there was the same expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness, when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about George Washington.  Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady’s father, Doctor Manette. Who was called accordingly.  “Doctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him before?”  “Once. When he called at my lodgings in London. Some three years, or three years and a half ago.”  “Can you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or speak to his conversation with your daughter?”  “Sir, I can do neither.”  “Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either?”  He answered, in a low voice, “There is.”  “Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?”  He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, “A long imprisonment.”  “Were you newly released on the occasion in question?”  “They tell me so.”  “Have you no remembrance of the occasion?”  “None. My mind is a blank, from some time—I cannot even say what time—when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to the time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter here. She had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored my faculties; but I am quite unable even to say how she had become familiar. I have no remembrance of the process.”  Mr. Attorney-General sat down, and the father and daughter sat down together.  A singular circumstance then arose in the case. The object in hand, being, to show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked, in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years ago, and got out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where he did not remain, but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more, to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information; a witness was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required, in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town, waiting for another person. The prisoner’s counsel was cross-examining this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him. Opening this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great attention and curiosity at the prisoner.  “You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?”  The witness was quite sure.  “Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?”  Not so like (the witness said) as that he could be mistaken.  “Look well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there,” pointing to him who had tossed the paper over, “and then look well upon the prisoner. How say you? Are they very like each other?”  Allowing for my learned friend’s appearance being careless and  slovenly if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise, not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus brought into comparison. My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside his wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became much more remarkable. My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver (the prisoner’s counsel), whether they were next to try Mr. Carton (name of my learned friend) for treason? But, Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord, no; but he would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once, might happen twice; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would be so confident, having seen it; and more. The upshot of which was, to smash this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case to useless lumber.  Mr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his fingers, in his following of the evidence. He had now to attend while Mr. Stryver fitted the prisoner’s case on the jury, like a compact suit of clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy and traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas—which he certainly did look rather like. How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and partner, and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family affairs in France, he being of French extraction, did require his making those passages across the Channel—though what those affairs were, a consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbad him, even for his life, to disclose. How the evidence that had been warped and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman and young lady so thrown together:—with the exception of that reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and impossible, to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke. How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies and fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it; how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous character of evidence too  often disfiguring such cases, and of which the State Trials of this country were full. But, there my Lord interposed (with as grave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions.  Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next to attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes Mr. Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the prisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.  And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again.  Mr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court, changed neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement. While his learned friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his papers before him, whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat, and slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man sat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal, his hands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all day. Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness, when they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would hardly have thought the two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the observation to his next neighbour, and added, “I’d hold half a guinea that he don’t get no law-work to do. Don’t look like the sort of one to get any, do he?”  Yet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he appeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manette’s head dropped upon her father’s breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly: \n The Likeness \n![008](bano_9781411433236_oeb_008_r1.jpg)\n“Officer! look to that young lady. Help the gentleman to take her out. Don’t you see she will fall!”  There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much sympathy with her father. It had evidently been a great distress to him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud, ever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a moment, spoke, through their foreman.  They were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord (perhaps with George Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were not agreed, but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward, and retired himself. The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in the court were now being lighted. It began to be rumoured that the jury would be out a long while. The spectators dropped off to get refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat down.  Mr. Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out, now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in the slackened interest, could easily get near him.  “Jerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can. But, keep in the way. You will be sure to hear when the jury come in. Don’t be a moment behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank. You are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple Bar long before I can.”  Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in acknowledgement of this communication and a shilling. Mr. Carton came up at the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm.  “How is the young lady?”  “She is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she feels the better for being out of court.”  “I’ll tell the prisoner so. It won’t do for a respectable bank gentleman like you, to be seen speaking to him publicly, you know.”  Mr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point in his mind, and Mr. Carton made his way to the outside of the bar. The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him, all eyes, ears, and spikes.  “Mr. Darnay!”  The prisoner came forward directly.  “You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette. She will do very well. You have seen the worst of her agitation.”  “I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it. Could you tell her so for me, with my fervent acknowledgements?”  “Yes, I could. I will, if you ask it.”  Mr. Carton’s manner was so careless as to be almost insolent. He stood, half turned from the prisoner, lounging with his elbow against the bar.  “I do ask it. Accept my cordial thanks.”  “What,” said Carton, still only half turned towards him, “do you expect, Mr. Darnay?”  “The worst.”  “It’s the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest. But I think their withdrawing is in your favour.”  Loitering on the way out of the court not being allowed, Jerry heard no more: but left them—so like each other in feature, so unlike each other in manner—standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above them.  An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale. The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried him along with them.  “Jerry! Jerry!” Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he got there.  “Here, sir! It’s a fight to get back again. Here I am, sir!”  Mr. Lorry handed him a paper through the throng. “Quick! Have you got it?”  “Yes, sir!”  Hastily written on the paper was the word “ACQUITTED.”  “If you had sent the message, ‘Recalled to Life,’ again,” muttered Jerry, as he turned, “I should have known what you meant, this time.”  He had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything else, until he was clear of the Old Bailey; for, the crowd came  pouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in search of other carrion. \n\n CHAPTER 4  Congratulatory  F rom the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor for the defence, and its counsel Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr. Charles Darnay—just released—congratu lating him on his escape from death.  It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise in Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the shoemaker of the garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent reason. While one external cause, and that a reference to his long lingering agony, would always—as on the trial—evoke this condition from the depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of itself, and to draw a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual Bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun, when the substance was three hundred miles away.  Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind. She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice, the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial influence with him almost always. Not absolutely always, for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few and slight, and she believed them over.  Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had    turned to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked. Mr. Stryver, a man of little more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout, loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.  \n Congratulations \n![009](bano_9781411433236_oeb_009_r1.jpg)\n He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean out of the group: “I am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr. Darnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the less likely to succeed on that account.”  “You have laid me under an obligation to you for life—in two senses,” said his late client, taking his hand.  “I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as another man’s, I believe.”  It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, “Much better,” Mr. Lorry said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested object of squeezing himself back again.  “You think so?” said Mr. Stryver. “Well! you have been present all day, and you ought to know. You are a man of business, too.”  “And as such,” quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered him out of it—“as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up this conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.”  “Speak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,” said Stryver; “I have a night’s work to do yet. Speak for yourself.”  “I speak for myself,” answered Mr. Lorry, “and for Mr. Darnay, and for Miss Lucie, and—Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?” He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father.  His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust, not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away.  “My father,” said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.  He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her.  “Shall we go home, my father?”  With a long breath, he answered “Yes.”  The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the impression—which he himself had originated—that he would not be released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning’s interest of gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should re-people it. Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed in it.  Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back to the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group, or interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He now stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement.  “So, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?”  Nobody had made any acknowledgement of Mr. Carton’s part in the day’s proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was none the better for it in appearance.  “If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.”  Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, “You have mentioned that before, sir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters. We have to think of the House more than ourselves.”  “ I know, I know,” rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. “Don’t be nettled, Mr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better, I dare say.”  “And indeed, sir,” pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, “I really don’t know what you have to do with the matter. If you’ll excuse me, as very much your elder, for saying so, I really don’t know that it is your business.”  “Business! Bless you, I have no business,” said Mr. Carton.  “It is a pity you have not, sir.”  “I think so, too.”  “If you had,” pursued Mr. Lorry, “perhaps you would attend to it.”  “Lord love you, no!—I shouldn’t,” said Mr. Carton.  “Well, sir!” cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference, “business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir, if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr. Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good-night, God bless you, sir! I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life.—Chair there!”  Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr. Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson’s. Carton, who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed then, and turned to Darnay:  “This is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This must be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones?”  “I hardly seem yet,” returned Charles Darnay, “to belong to this world again.”  “I don’t wonder at it; it’s not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another. You speak faintly.”  “I begin to think I am faint.”  “Then why the devil don’t you dine? I dined, myself, while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to—this, or some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.”  Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgatehill to Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.  “Do you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr. Darnay?”  “I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far mended as to feel that.”  “It must be an immense satisfaction!”  He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large one.  “As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it. It has no good in it for me—except wine like this—nor I for it. So we are not much alike in that particular. Indeed, I begin to think we are not much alike in any particular, you and I.”  Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay was at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.  “Now your dinner is done,” Carton presently said, “why don’t you call a health, Mr. Darnay; why don’t you give your toast?”  “What health? What toast?”  “Why, it’s on the tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be, I’ll swear it’s there.”  “Miss Manette, then!”  “Miss Manette, then!”  Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, Carton flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered to pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.  “That’s a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay!” he said, filling his new goblet.  A slight frown and a laconic “Yes,” were the answer.  “That’s a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How does it feel? Is it worth being tried for one’s life, to be the object of such sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?”  Again Darnay answered not a word.  “She was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.”  The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it.  “I neither want any thanks, nor merit any,” was the careless rejoinder. “It was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don’t know why I did it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.”  “Willingly, and a small return for your good offices.”  “Do you think I particularly like you?”  “Really, Mr. Carton,” returned the other, oddly disconcerted, “I have not asked myself the question.”  “But ask yourself the question now.”  “You have acted as if you do; but I don’t think you do.”  “ I don’t think I do,” said Carton. “I begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding.”  “Nevertheless,” pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, “there is nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our parting without ill-blood on either side.”  Carton rejoining, “Nothing in life!” Darnay rang. “Do you call the whole reckoning?” said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, “Then bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at ten.”  The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good-night. Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat of defiance in his manner, and said, “A last word, Mr. Darnay: you think I am drunk?”  “I think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.”  “Think? You know I have been drinking.”  “Since I must say so, I know it.”  “Then you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir. I care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.”  “Much to be regretted. You might have used your talents better.”  “May be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not. Don’t let your sober face elate you, however; you don’t know what it may come to. Good-night!”  When he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to a glass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it.  “Do you particularly like the man?” he muttered, at his own image; “why should you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is nothing in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a change you have made in yourself! A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you what you have fallen away from, and what you might have been! Change places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was? Come on, and have it out in plain words! You hate the fellow.”  He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a  few minutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with his hair straggling over the table, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him. \n\n CHAPTER 5  The Jackal  T hose were drinking days, and most men drank hard. So very great is the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration. The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was Mr. Stryver, already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative practice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the drier parts of the legal race.  A favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which he mounted. Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite, specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King’s Bench, the florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out of the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank gardenfull of flaring companions.  It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is among the most striking and necessary of the advocate’s accomplishments. But a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. The more business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow; and however late at night  he sat carousing with Sydney Carton, he always had his points at his fingers’ ends in the morning.  Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver’s great ally. What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and Michaelmas, might have floated a king’s ship. Stryver never had a case in hand, anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. At last, it began to get about, among such as were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal, and that he rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity.  “Ten o’clock, sir,” said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged to wake him—“ten o’clock, sir.”  “ What’s the matter?”  “Ten o’clock, sir.”  “What do you mean? Ten o’clock at night?”  “Yes, sir. Your honour told me to call you.”  “Oh! I remember. Very well, very well.”  After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes, he got up, tossed his hat on, and walked out. He turned into the Temple, and, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King’s Bench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver chambers.  The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone home, and the Stryver principal opened the door. He had his slippers on, and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease. He had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which may be observed in all free livers of his class, from the portrait of Jeffries downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of Art, through the portraits of every Drinking Age.  “You are a little late, Memory,” said Stryver.  “About the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later.”  They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers, where there was a blazing fire. A kettle steamed upon the hob,  and in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of wine upon it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.  “You have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney.”  “Two to-night, I think. I have been dining with the day’s client; or seeing him dine—it’s all one!”  “That was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the identification. How did you come by it? When did it strike you?”  “I thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should have been much the same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck.”  Mr. Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch. “You and your luck, Sydney! Get to work, get to work.”  Sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoining room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a towel or two. Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down at the table, and said, “Now I am ready!”  “Not much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory,” said Mr. Stryver, gaily, as he looked among his papers.  “How much?”  “Only two sets of them.”  “Give me the worst first.”  “There they are, Sydney. Fire away!”  The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to his hand. Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face, so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out for his glass—which often groped about, for a minute or more, before it found the glass for his lips. Two or three times, the matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on him to get up, and steep his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp head-gear as no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity.  At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution, made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal assisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate.The jackal then invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal; this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.  “And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch,” said Mr. Stryver.  The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.  “You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses to-day. Every question told.”  “I always am sound; am I not?”  “I don’t gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some punch to it and smooth it again.”  With the deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.  “The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School,” said Stryver, nodding his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, “the old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and now in despondency!”  “Ah!” returned the other, sighing: “yes! The same Sydney, with the same luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own.”  “And why not?”  “God knows. It was my way, I suppose.”  He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before him, looking at the fire.  “Carton,” said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air, as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, “your way is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose. Look at me.”  “Oh, botheration!” returned Sydney, with a lighter and more good-humoured laugh, “don’t you be moral!”  “How have I done what I have done?” said Stryver; “how do I do what I do?”  “Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it’s not worth your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to do, you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was al ways behind.”  “I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?”  “I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,” said Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.  “Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,” pursued Carton, “you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into mine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris, picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we didn’t get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always—nowhere.”  “And whose fault was that?”  “Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were al ways driving and riving and shouldering and pressing, to that restless degree that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. It’s a gloomy thing, however, to talk about one’s own past, with the day breaking. Turn me in some other direction before I go.”  “Well then! Pledge me to the pretty witness,” said Stryver, holding up his glass. “Are you turned in a pleasant direction?”  Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.  “Pretty witness,” he muttered, looking down into his glass. “I have had enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who’s your pretty witness?”  “The picturesque doctor’s daughter, Miss Manette.”  “ She pretty?”  “Is she not?”  “Why, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole Court!”  “Rot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey a judge of beauty? She was a golden-haired doll!”  “Do you know, Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes, and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: “do you know, I rather thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll, and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?”  “Quick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a yard or two of a man’s nose, he can see it without a perspective-glass. I pledge you, but I deny the beauty. And now I’ll have no more drink; I’ll get to bed.”  When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy windows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.  Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight. A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its pillow was wet with wasted tears.  Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away. \n\n CHAPTER 6  Hundreds of People  T he quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not far from Soho-square. On the afternoon of a cer tain fine Sunday when the waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived, on his way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor’s friend, and the quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.  On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie; secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the Doctor’s household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them.  A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be found in London. There was no way through it, and the front windows of the Doctor’s lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that had a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few buildings then, north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. As a consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom, instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which the peaches ripened in their season.  The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow, though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.  There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large still house, where several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In a building at the back, attainable by a court-yard where a plane-tree rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some  mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall—as if he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way from Sunday morning unto Saturday night.  Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him. His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and he earned as much as he wanted.  These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry’s knowledge, thoughts, and notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner, on the fine Sunday afternoon.  “Doctor Manette at home?”  Expected home.  “Miss Lucie at home?”  Expected home.  “Miss Pross at home?”  Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the fact.  “As I am at home myself,” said Mr. Lorry, “I’ll go upstairs.”  Although the Doctor’s daughter had known nothing of the country of her birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most agreeable characteristics. Simple as the furniture was, it was set off by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy, that its effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours, the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him, with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time, whether he approved?  There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which he detected all around him, walked from one to another. The first was the best room, and in it were Lucie’s birds, and flowers, and books, and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was the Doctor’s consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third, changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the Doctor’s bed-room—and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker’s bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.  “I wonder,” said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, “that he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him!”  “And why wonder at that?” was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.  It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and had since improved.  “I should have thought—” Mr. Lorry began.  “Pooh! You’d have thought!” said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off.  “How do you do?” inquired that lady then—sharply, and yet as if to express that she bore him no malice.  “I am pretty well, I thank you,” answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; “how are you?”  “Nothing to boast of,” said Miss Pross.  “Indeed?”  “Ah! indeed!” said Miss Pross. “I am very much put out about my Ladybird.”  “Indeed?”  “For gracious sake say something else besides ‘indeed,’ or you’ll fidget me to death,” said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from stature) was shortness.  “Really, then?” said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.  “Really, is bad enough,” returned Miss Pross, “but better. Yes, I am very much put out.”  “May I ask the cause?”  “I don’t want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to come here looking after her,” said Miss Pross.  “ Do dozens come for that purpose?”  “Hundreds,” said Miss Pross.  It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned, she exaggerated it.  “Dear me!” said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of.  “I have lived with the darling—or the darling has lived with me, and paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may take your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her for nothing—since she was ten years old. And it’s really very hard,” said Miss Pross.  Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his head; using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would fit anything.  “All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet, are always turning up,” said Miss Pross. “When you began it—”  “ I began it, Miss Pross?”  “Didn’t you? Who brought her father to life?”  “Oh! If that was beginning it—” said Mr. Lorry.  “It wasn’t ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any circumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven him), to take Ladybird’s affections away from me.”  Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by this time to be, beneath the surface of her eccentricity, one of those unselfish creatures—found only among women—who will, for pure love and admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives. He knew  enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own mind—we all make such arrangements, more or less—he stationed Miss Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson’s.  “There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,” said Miss Pross; “and that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn’t made a mistake in life.”  Here again: Mr. Lorry’s inquiries into Miss Pross’s personal history had established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with no touch of compunction. Miss Pross’s fidelity of belief in Solomon (deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her.  “As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of business,” he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had sat down there in friendly relations, “let me ask you—does the Doctor, in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?”  “Never.”  “And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?”  “Ah!” returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. “But I don’t say he don’t refer to it within himself.”  “Do you believe that he thinks of it much?”  “I do,” said Miss Pross.  “Do you imagine—” Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him up short with:  “Never imagine anything. Have no imagination at all.”  “I stand corrected; do you suppose—you go so far as to suppose, sometimes?”  “Now and then,” said Miss Pross.  “Do you suppose,” Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, “that Doctor Manette has any theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to the  cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his oppressor?”  “I don’t suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.”  “And that is—?”  “That she thinks he has.”  “Now don’t be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.”  “Dull?” Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.  Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, “No, no, no. Surely not. To return to business:—Is it not remarkable that Doctor Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say with me, though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him? Believe me, Miss Pross, I don’t approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of zealous interest.”  “Well! To the best of my understanding, and bad’s the best, you’ll tell me,” said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, “he is afraid of the whole subject.”  “Afraid?”  “It’s plain enough, I should think, why he may be. It’s a dreadful remembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. Not knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never feel certain of not losing himself again. That alone wouldn’t make the subject pleasant, I should think.”  It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. “True,” said he, “and fearful to reflect upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, Miss Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression always shut up within him. Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence.”  “Can’t be helped,” said Miss Pross, shaking her head. “Touch that string, and he instantly changes for the worse. Better leave it alone. In short, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he gets up in the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking up and down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird has learnt to know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking  up and down, in his old prison. She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up and down, walking up and down, until he is composed. But he never says a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it best not to hint at it to him. In silence they go walking up and down together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have brought him to himself.”  Notwithstanding Miss Pross’s denial of her own imagination, there was a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea, in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to her possessing such a thing.  The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going.  “Here they are!” said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference; “and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!”  It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window, looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied they would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross was ready at the street door to receive them.  Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking off her darling’s bonnet when she came upstairs, and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleasant sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against her taking so much trouble for her—which last she only dared to do playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too, beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking  his bachelor stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain for the fulfilment of Miss Pross’s prediction.  Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements of the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and always acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be better. Miss Pross’s friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would impart culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress, or Cinderella’s Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit, a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she pleased.  On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor’s table, but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower regions, or in her own room on the second floor—a blue chamber, to which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this occasion, Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird’s pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.  It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit there in the air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her, they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for the special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She had installed herself, some time before, as Mr. Lorry’s cup-bearer; and while they sat under the plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. Mysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree whispered to them in its own way above their heads.  Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he was only One.  Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and  body, and retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, “a fit of the jerks.”  The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the likeness.  He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual vivacity. “Pray, Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the plane-tree—and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand, which happened to be the old buildings of London—“have you seen much of the Tower?”  “Lucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.”  “ I have been there, as you remember,” said Darnay, with a smile, though reddening a little angrily, “in another character, and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a curious thing when I was there.”  “What was that?” Lucie asked.  “In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners—dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand. At first, they were read as D.I.C.; but, on being more carefully examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG. The floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag. What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.”  “My father,” exclaimed Lucie, “you are ill!”  He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner and his look quite terrified them all.  “No, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they made me start. We had better go in.”  He recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in large drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it. But, he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House.  He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of his business eye. The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and that the rain had startled him.  Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon her, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he made only Two.  The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and windows open, they were overpowered by heat. When the tea-table was done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and some of the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.  “The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,” said Doctor Manette. “It comes slowly.”  “It comes surely,” said Carton.  They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.  There was a great hurry in the streets, of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a footstep was there.  “A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!” said Darnay, when they had listened for a while.  “Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?” asked Lucie. “Sometimes, I have sat here of an evening, until I have fancied—but even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder tonight, when all is so black and solemn—”  “Let us shudder too. We may know what it is.”  “It will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-and-by into our lives.”  “There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,” Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.  The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some, as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in the distant streets, and not one within sight.  “Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or are we to divide them among us?”  “I don’t know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you asked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life, and my father’s.”  “I take them into mine!” said Carton. “ I ask no questions and make no stipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss Manette, and I see them!—by the Lightning.” He added the last words, after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window.  “And I hear them!” he added again, after a peal of thunder. “Here they come, fast, fierce, and furious!”  It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him, for no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment’s interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at midnight.  The great bell of Saint Paul’s was striking One in the cleared air,  when Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful of footpads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier.  “What a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry,” said Mr. Lorry, “to bring the dead out of their graves.”  “I never see the night myself, master—nor yet I don’t expect to see it—what would do that,” answered Jerry.  “Good-night, Mr. Carton,” said the man of business. “Good-night, Mr. Darnay. Shall we ever see such a night again, together!”  \nPerhaps. Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar, bearing down upon them, too. \n\n CHAPTER 7  Monseigneur in Town  M onseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great many things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning’s chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four strong men besides the Cook.  Yes. It took four men, all four a-blaze with gorgeous decoration, and the Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur’s lips. One lacquey carried the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for  that function; a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold watches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for Monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ig nobly waited on by only three men; he must have died of two.  Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and state secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly favoured!—always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted days of the merry Stuart who sold it.  Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his way—tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the original by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: “The earth and the fulness thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.”  Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General, poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer rooms, much prostrated before by mankind—always excepting superior mankind of  the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt.  A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women waited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could, the Farmer-General—howsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social morality—was at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.  For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business—if that could have been anybody’s business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military officers destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship; civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives; all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the score. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State, yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals,  at this wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time—and has been since—to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur—forming a goodly half of the polite company—would have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and appearance, owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this world—which does not go far towards the realisation of the name of mother—there was no such thing known to the fashion. Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close, and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty.  The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising way of setting them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the spot—thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the Future, for Monseigneur’s guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a jargon about “the Centre of Truth:” holding that Man had got out of the Centre of Truth—which did hot need much demonstration—but had not got out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre, by fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much discoursing with spirits went on—and it did a world of good which never became manifest.  But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only been ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of  hair, such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells; and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and his devouring hunger far away.  Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all things in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that was never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals of Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball descended to the common Executioner: who, in persuance of the charm, was required to officiate “frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps, and white silk stockings.” At the gallows and the wheel—the axe was a rarity—Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Or-leans, and the rest, to call him, presided in this dainty dress. And who among the company at Monseigneur’s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would see the very stars out!  Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown open, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven—which may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never troubled it.  Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of Truth. There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate sprites, and was seen no more.  The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm, and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. There  was soon but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his way out.  “I devote you,” said this person, stopping at the last door on his way, and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, “to the Devil!”  With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet, and quietly walked down stairs.  He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness; every feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose, beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top of each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect the face made, it was a handsome face, and a remarkable one.  Its owner went down stairs into the court-yard, got into his carriage, and drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age, that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a barbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were left to get out of their difficulties as they could.  With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women  screaming before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.  But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded behind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry, and there were twenty hands at the horses’ bridles.  “What has gone wrong?” said Monsieur, calmly looking out.  A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.  “Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!” said a ragged and submissive man, “it is a child.”  “Why does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?”  “Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis—it is a pity—yes.”  The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.  “Killed!” shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at their length above his head, and staring at him. “Dead!”  The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.  He took out his purse.  “It is extraordinary to me,” said he, “that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses? See! Give him that.”  He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, “Dead!”  He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest made way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder, sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They were as silent, however, as the men.  “I know all, I know all,” said that last comer. “Be a brave man, my Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to live. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour as happily?”  “You are a philosopher, you there,” said the Marquis, smiling. “How do they call you?”  “They call me Defarge.”  “Of what trade?”  “Monsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.”  “Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,” said the Marquis throwing him another gold coin, “and spend it as you will. The horses there; are they right?”  Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broken some common thing, and had paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor.  “Hold!” said Monsieur the Marquis. “Hold the horses! Who threw that?”  He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.  “You dogs!” said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front, except as to the spots on his nose: “I would ride over any of you very willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew which rascal threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he should be crushed under the wheels.”  So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. Among the men, not one. But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily,  and looked the Marquis in the face. It was not for his dignity to notice it; his contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word “Go on!”  He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by. The rats had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through which they peeped.The father had long ago taken up his bundle and hidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball—when the one woman who had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness of Fate.The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule, time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all things ran their course. \n\n CHAPTER 8  Monseigneur in the Country  A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant. Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly—a dejected disposition to give up, and wither away.  Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the  Marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control—the setting sun.  The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson. “It will die out,” said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, “directly.”  In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow left when the drag was taken off.  But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was coming near home.  The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relay of post-horses, poor fountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors, shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten. Expressive signs of what made them poor, were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.  Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and women, their choice on earth was stated in the prospect—Life on the lowest terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill; or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.  Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions’ whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the fountain, and the peasants suspended their  operations to look at him. He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years.  Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that drooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before Monseigneur of the Court—only the difference was, that these faces drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate—when a grizzled mender of the roads joined the group.  “Bring me hither that fellow!” said the Marquis to the courier.  The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed round to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain.  “I passed you on the road?”  “Monseigneur, it is true. I had the honour of being passed on the road.”  “Coming up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?”  “Monseigneur, it is true.”  “What did you look at, so fixedly?”  “Monseigneur, I looked at the man.”  He stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage. All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage.  “What man, pig? And why look there?”  “Pardon, Monseigneur; he swung by the chain of the shoe—the drag.”  “Who?” demanded the traveller.  “Monseigneur, the man.”  “May the Devil carry away these idiots! How do you call the man? You know all the men of this part of the country. Who was he?”  “Your clemency, Monseigneur! He was not of this part of the country. Of all the days of my life, I never saw him.”  “Swinging by the chain? To be suffocated?”  “With your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur. His head hanging over—like this!”  He turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his face thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recovered himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow.  \n The Stoppage at the Fountain \n![010](bano_9781411433236_oeb_010_r1.jpg)\n “What was he like?”  “Monseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust, white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!”  The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur the Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his conscience.  “Truly, you did well,” said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him, “to see a thief accompanying my carriage, and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him aside, Monsieur Gabelle!”  Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an official manner.  “Bah! Go aside!” said Monsieur Gabelle.  “Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village to night, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle.”  “Monseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders.”  “Did he run away, fellow?—where is that Accursed?”  The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap. Some half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and presented him breathless to Monsieur the Marquis.  “Did the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?”  “Monseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first, as a person plunges into the river.”  “See to it, Gabelle. Go on!”  The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or they might not have been so fortunate.  The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill. Gradually, it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night. The postilions, with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended the points to the lashes of their  whips; the valet walked by the horses; the courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dim distance.  At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground, with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor figure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had studied the figure from the life—his own life, maybe—for it was dreadfully spare and thin.  To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling. She turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and presented herself at the carriage-door.  “It is you, Monseigneur! Monseigneur, a petition.”  With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face, Monseigneur looked out.  “How, then! What is it? Always petitions!”  “Monseigneur. For the love of the great God! My husband, the forester.”  “What of your husband, the forester? Always the same with you people. He cannot pay something?”  “He has paid all, Monseigneur. He is dead.”  “Well! He is quiet. Can I restore him to you?”  “Alas, no, Monseigneur! But he lies yonder, under a little heap of poor grass.”  “Well?”  “Monseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?”  “Again, well?”  She looked an old woman, but was young. Her manner was one of passionate grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door—tenderly, caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to feel the appealing touch.  “Monseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My husband died of want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want.”  “Again, well? Can I feed them?”  “Monseigneur, the good God knows; but I don’t ask it. My petition is, that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband’s name, may be placed over him to show where he lies. Otherwise, the place  will be quickly forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady, I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass. Monseigneur, they are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want. Monseigneur! Monseigneur!”  The valet had put her away from the door, the carriage had broken into a brisk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she was left far behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and his château.  The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him and rose, as the rain falls, impartially, on the dusty, ragged, and toil-worn group at the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the aid of the blue cap without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon his man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it. By degrees, as they could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled in little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more stars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having been extinguished.  The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many overhanging trees, was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time; and the shadow was exchanged for the light of a flambeau, as his carriage stopped, and the great door of his château was opened to him.  “Monsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he arrived from England?”  “Monseigneur, not yet.” \n\n CHAPTER 9  The Head  I t was a heavy mass of building, that château of Monsieur the Marquis, with a large stone court-yard before it, and two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in  all directions. As if the Gorgon’s head had surveyed it, when it was finished, two centuries ago.  Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau preceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile of stable building away among the trees. All else was so quiet, that the flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being in the open night-air. Other sound than the owl’s voice there was none, save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then heave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again.  The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase; grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his lord was angry.  Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the night, Monsieur the Marquis, with his flambeau-bearer going on before, went up the staircase to a door in a corridor. This thrown open, admitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed chamber and two others. High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great dogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all luxuries befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country. The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to break—the fourteenth Louis—was conspicuous in their rich furniture; but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old pages in the history of France.  A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round room, in one of the château’s four extinguisher-topped towers. A small lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.  “My nephew,” said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation; “they said he was not arrived.”  Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.  “Ah! It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the table as it is. I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.”  In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his sumptuous and choice supper. His chair was opposite to the window, and he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his lips, when he put it down.  “What is that?” he calmly asked, looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour.  “Monseigneur? That?”  “Outside the blinds. Open the blinds.”  It was done.  “Well?”  “Monseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are here.”  The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into the vacant darkness, and stood, with that blank behind him, looking round for instructions.  “Good,” said the imperturbable master. “Close them again.”  That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper. He was half-way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand, hearing the sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to the front of the château.  “Ask who is arrived.”  It was the nephew of Monseigneur. He had been some few leagues behind Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. He had diminished the distance rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road. He had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him.  He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and there, and that he was prayed to come to it. In a little while he came. He had been known in England as Charles Darnay.  Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake hands.  “You left Paris yesterday, sir?” he said to Monseigneur, as he took his seat at table.  “Yesterday. And you?”  “I come direct.”  “From London?”  “Yes.”  “You have been a long time coming,” said the Marquis, with a smile.  “On the contrary; I come direct.”  “Pardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time intending the journey.”  “I have been detained by”—the nephew stopped a moment in his answer—“various business.”  “Without doubt,” said the polished uncle.  So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them. When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew, looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a fine mask, opened a conversation.  “I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that took me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have sustained me.”  “Not to death,” said the uncle; “it is not necessary to say, to death.”  “I doubt, sir,” returned the nephew, “whether, if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.”  The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not reassuring.  “Indeed, sir,” pursued the nephew, “for anything I know, you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me.”  “No, no, no,” said the uncle pleasantly.  “But, however that may be,” resumed the nephew, glancing at him with deep distrust, “I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means, and would know no scruple as to means.”  “My friend, I told you so,” said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the two marks. “Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago.”  “I recall it.”  “Thank you,” said the Marquis—very sweetly indeed.  His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical instrument.  “In effect, sir,” pursued the nephew, “I believe it to be at once your bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in France here.”  “I do not quite understand,” returned the uncle, sipping his coffee. “Dare I ask you to explain?”  “I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.”  “It is possible,” said the uncle, with great calmness. “For the honour of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent. Pray excuse me!”  “I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,” observed the nephew.  “I would not say happily, my friend,” returned the uncle, with refined politeness; “I would not be sure of that. A good opportunity for consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say, at a disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity. They are sought by so many, and they are granted (comparatively) to so few! It used not to be so, but France in all such things is changed for the worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom), one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter— his daughter? We have lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very bad!”  The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head; as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still containing himself, that great means of regeneration.  “We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the  modern time also,” said the nephew, gloomily, “that I believe our name to be more detested than any name in France.”  “Let us hope so,” said the uncle. “Detestation of the high is the involuntary homage of the low.”  “There is not,” pursued the nephew, in his former tone, “a face I can look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.”  “A compliment,” said the Marquis, “to the grandeur of the family, merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur. Hah!” And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly crossed his legs.  But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness, and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer’s assumption of indifference.  “Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear and slavery, my friend,” observed the Marquis, “will keep the dogs obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,” looking up to it, “shuts out the sky.”  That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of the château as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as they were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked ruins. As for the roof he vaunted, he might have found that shutting out the sky in a new way—to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.  “Meanwhile,” said the Marquis, “I will preserve the honour and repose of the family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we terminate our conference for the night?”  “A moment more.”  “An hour, if you please.”  “Sir,” said the nephew, “we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits of wrong.”  “ We have done wrong?” repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile, and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.  “Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much  account to both of us, in such different ways. Even in my father’s time, we did a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and our pleasure, what ever it was. Why need I speak of my father’s time, when it is equally yours? Can I separate my father’s twin-brother, joint inheritor, and next successor, from himself?”  “Death has done that!” said the Marquis.  “And has left me,” answered the nephew, “bound to a system that is frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to execute the last request of my dear mother’s lips, and obey the last look of my dear mother’s eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.”  “Seeking them from me, my nephew,” said the Marquis, touching him on the breast with his forefinger—they were now standing by the hearth—“you will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.”  Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he touched him on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the body, and said,  “My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have lived.”  When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his box in his pocket.  “Better to be a rational creature,” he added then, after ringing a small bell on the table, “and accept your natural destiny. But you are lost, Monsieur Charles, I see.”  “This property and France are lost to me,” said the nephew, sadly; “I renounce them.”  “Are they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?”  “I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed to me from you, to-morrow—”  “Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable.”  “—or twenty years hence—”  “You do me too much honour,” said the Marquis; “still, I prefer that supposition.”  “—I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little to relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin?”  “Hah!” said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.  “To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity, under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste, mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness, and suffering.”  “Hah!” said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.  “If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a curse on it, and on all this land.”  “And you?” said the uncle. “Forgive my curiosity; do you, under your new philosophy, graciously intend to live?”  “I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at their backs, may have to do some day—work.”  “In England, for example?”  “Yes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.”  The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be lighted. It now shone brightly, through the door of communication. The Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his valet.  “England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have prospered there,” he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew with a smile.  “I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may be indebted to you, sir. For the rest, it is my Refuge.”  “They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many.You know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? A Doctor?”  “Yes.”  “With a daughter?”  “Yes.”  “Yes,” said the Marquis. “You are fatigued. Good-night!”  As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words, which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At the same time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the  thin straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic.  “Yes,” repeated the Marquis. “A Doctor with a daughter.Yes. So commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good-night!”  It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the château as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew looked at him in vain, in passing on to the door.  “Good-night!” said the uncle. “I look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his chamber there!—And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,” he added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his valet to his own bedroom.  The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still night. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:—looked like some enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just coming on.  He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the scraps of the day’s journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the chain under the carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain, the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the tall man with his arms up, crying, “Dead!”  “I am cool now,” said Monsieur the Marquis, “and may go to bed.”  So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin gauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.  The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours the horses in the stables rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to the owl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures hardly ever to say what is set down for them.  For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the château, lion and  human, stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all the landscape, dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads. The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village, taxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and freed.  The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain at the château dropped unseen and unheard—both melting away, like the minutes that were falling from the spring of Time—through three dark hours. Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light, and the eyes of the stone faces of the château were opened.  Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still trees, and poured its radiance over the hill. In the glow, the water of the château fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces crimsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bedchamber of Monsieur the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might. At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with opened mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.  Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Casement windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth shivering—chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began the rarely lightened toil of the day among the village population. Some, to the fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. In the church and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its foot.  The château awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and surely. First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine; now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked round over their shoulders at the light  and freshness pouring in at doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.  All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the return of morning. Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the château, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?  What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day’s dinner (not much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow’s while to peck at, on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains of it to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds? Whether or no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life, down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the fountain.  All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of the people of the château, and some of those of the posting-house, and all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was highly fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting himself in the breast with his blue cap. What did all this portend, and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle (double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of the German ballad of Leonora?  It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the château.  The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited through about two hundred years.  It lay back on the pillow on Monsieur the Marquis. It was like a fine mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. Driven home into the heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:  “ Drive him fast to his tomb.This, from JACQUES.” \n\n CHAPTER 10  Two Promises  M ore months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French language who was conversant with French literature. In this age, he would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides, in sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters were not at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had dropped out of Tellson’s ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a tutor, whose attainments made the student’s way unusually pleasant and profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became known and encouraged. He was well acquainted, moreover, with the circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest. So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.  In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor to lie on beds of roses: if he had had any such exalted expectation, he would not have prospered. He had expected labour, and he found it, and did it, and made the best of it. In this, his prosperity consisted.  A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove  a contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek and Latin through the Custom-house. The rest of his time he passed in London.  Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has invariably gone one way—Charles Darnay’s way—the way of the love of a woman.  He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had never heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice; he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for him. But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination at the deserted château far away beyond the heaving water and the long, long, dusty roads—the solid stone château which had itself become the mere mist of a dream—had been done a year, and he had never yet, by so much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.  That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation, he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity of opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.  He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now a very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.  He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with ease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.  “Charles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.”  “I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,” he answered, a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. “Miss Manette—”  “Is well,” said the Doctor, as he stopped short, “and your return will delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but will soon be home.”  “Doctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her being from home, to beg to speak to you.”  There was a blank silence.  “Yes?” said the Doctor, with evident constraint. “Bring your chair here, and speak on.”  He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less easy.  “I have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,” so he at length began, “for some year and a half, that I hope the topic on which I am about to touch may not—”  He was stayed by the Doctor’s putting out his hand to stop him. When he had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back:  “Is Lucie the topic?”  “She is.”  “It is hard for me to speak of her, at any time. It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.”  “It is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor Manette!” he said deferentially.  There was another blank silence before her father rejoined:  “I believe it. I do you justice; I believe it.”  His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles Darnay hesitated.  “Shall I go on, sir?”  Another blank.  “Yes, go on.”  “You anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly, disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love her. You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!”  The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the  ground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly, and cried:  “Not that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!”  His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles Darnay’s ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter so received it, and remained silent.  “I ask your pardon,” said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some moments. “I do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it.”  He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or raise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair overshadowed his face:  “Have you spoken to Lucie?”  “No.”  “Nor written?”  “Never.”  “It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is to be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks you.”  He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.  “I know,” said Darnay, respectfully, “how can I fail to know, Doctor Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, and that it can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and child. I know, Dr. Manette—how can I fail to know—that, mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy itself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the early days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your neck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her own age, sees and loves you  at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted, loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home.”  Her father sat silent, with his face bent down. His breathing was a little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.  “Dear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as long as it was in the nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even now feel, that to bring my love—even mine—between you, is to touch your history with something not quite so good as itself. But I love her. Heaven is my witness that I love her!”  “I believe it,” answered her father, mournfully. “I have thought so before now. I believe it.”  “But, do not believe,” said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful voice struck with a reproachful sound, “that if my fortune were so cast as that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any time put any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe a word of what I now say. Besides that I should know it to be hopeless, I should know it to be a baseness. If I had any such possibility, even at a remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my heart—if it ever had been there—if it ever could be there—I could not now touch this honoured hand.”  He laid his own upon it as he spoke.  “No, dear Doctor Manette. Like you, a voluntary exile from France; like you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your life and home, and being faithful to you to the death. Not to divide with Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be.”  His touch still lingered on her father’s hand. Answering the touch for a moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms of his chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the conference. A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.  “You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I  thank you with all my heart, and will open all my heart—or nearly so. Have you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?”  “None. As yet, none.”  “Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once ascertain that, with my knowledge?”  “Not even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow.”  “Do you seek any guidance from me?”  “I ask none, sir. But I have thought it possible that you might have it in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.”  “Do you seek any promise from me?”  “I do seek that.”  “What is it?”  “I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her innocent heart—do not think I have the presumption to assume so much—I could retain no place in it against her love for her father.”  “If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?”  “I understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor’s favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. For which reason, Doctor Manette,” said Darnay, modestly but firmly, “I would not ask that word, to save my life.”  “I am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and delicate, and difficult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in this one respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her heart.”  “May I ask, sir, if you think she is—” As he hesitated, her father supplied the rest.  “Is sought by any other suitor?”  “It is what I meant to say.”  Her father considered a little before he answered:  “You have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too, occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.”  “Or both,” said Darnay.  “I had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You want a promise from me. Tell me what it is.”  “It is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her  own part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope you may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask. The condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to require, I will observe immediately.”  “I give the promise,” said the Doctor, “without any condition. I believe your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it. I believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties between me and my other and far dearer self. If she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you. If there were—Charles Darnay, if there were—”  The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as the Doctor spoke:  “—any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever, new or old, against the man she really loved—the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his head—they should all be obliterated for her sake. She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me than wrong, more to me—Well! This is idle talk.”  So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.  “You said something to me,” said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile. “What was it you said to me?”  He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:  “Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother’s, is not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what that is, and why I am in England.”  “Stop!” said the Doctor of Beauvais.  “I wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no secret from you.”  “Stop!”  For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay’s lips.  “Tell me when I ask you, not now. If your suit should prosper, if  Lucie should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning. Do you promise?”  “Willingly.”  “Give me your hand. She will be home directly, and it is better she should not see us together to-night. Go! God bless you!”  It was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later and darker when Lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone—for Miss Pross had gone straight upstairs—and was surprised to find his reading-chair empty.  “My father!” she called to him. “Father dear!”  Nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound in his bedroom. Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked in at his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her blood all chilled, “What shall I do! What shall I do!”  Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at his door, and softly called to him. The noise ceased at the sound of her voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and down together for a long time.  She came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night. He slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old unfinished work, were all as usual. \n\n CHAPTER 11  A Companion Picture  “ S ydney,” said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his jackal; “mix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you.”  Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before, and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver’s papers before the setting in of the long vacation. The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until November should come with its fogs atmospheric and fogs legal, and bring grist to the mill again.  Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much application. It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him through the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at intervals for the last six hours.  “Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?” said Stryver the portly, with his hands in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he lay on his back.  “I am.”  “Now, look here! I am going to tell you something that will rather surprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as shrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry.”  “ Do you?”  “Yes. And not for money. What do you say now?”  “I don’t feel disposed to say much. Who is she?”  “Guess.”  “Do I know her?”  “Guess.”  “I am not going to guess, at five o’clock in the morning, with my brains frying and sputtering in my head. If you want me to guess, you must ask me to dinner.”  “Well then, I’ll tell you,” said Stryver, coming slowly into a sitting posture. “Sydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you, because you are such a insensible dog.”  “And you,” returned Sydney, busy concocting the punch, “are such a sensitive and poetical spirit.”  “Come!” rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, “though I don’t prefer any claim to being the soul of Romance (for I hope I know better), still I am a tenderer sort of fellow than you. ”  “You are a luckier, if you mean that.”  “I don’t mean that. I mean I am a man of more—more—”  “Say gallantry, while you are about it,” suggested Carton.  “Well! I’ll say gallantry. My meaning is that I am a man,” said  Stryver, inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, “who cares more to be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how to be agreeable, in a woman’s society, than you do.”  “Go on,” said Sydney Carton.  “No; but before I go on,” said Stryver, shaking his head in his bullying way, “I’ll have this out with you. You’ve been at Dr. Manette’s house as much as I have, or more than I have. Why, I have been ashamed of your moroseness there! Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and hang-dog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have been ashamed of you, Sydney!”  “It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to be ashamed of anything,” returned Sydney; “you ought to be much obliged to me.”  “You shall not get off in that way,” rejoined Stryver, shouldering the rejoinder at him; “no, Sydney, it’s my duty to tell you—and I tell you to your face to do you good—that you are a de-vilish ill-conditioned fellow in that sort of society. You are a disagreeable fellow.”  Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed.  “Look at me!” said Stryver, squaring himself; “I have less need to make myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances. Why do I do it?”  “I never saw you do it yet,” muttered Carton.  “I do it because it’s politic; I do it on principle. And look at me! I get on.”  “You don’t get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,” answered Carton, with a careless air; “I wish you would keep to that. As to me—will you never understand that I am incorrigible?”  He asked the question with some appearance of scorn.  “You have no business to be incorrigible,” was his friend’s answer, delivered in no very soothing tone.  “I have no business to be, at all, that I know of,” said Sydney Carton. “Who is the lady?”  “Now, don’t let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable, Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious friendliness for the disclosure he was about to make, “because I know you don’t mean half you say; and if you meant it all, it would  be of no importance. I make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to me in slighting terms.”  “I did?”  “Certainly; and in these chambers.”  Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend; drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.  “You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll. The young lady is Miss Manette. If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been a little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not. You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when I think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man’s opinion of a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures; or of a piece of music of mine, who had no ear for music.”  Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers, looking at his friend.  “Now you know all about it, Syd,” said Mr. Stryver. “I don’t care about fortune: she is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind to please myself: on the whole, I think I can afford to please myself. She will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man, and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her, but she is worthy of good fortune. Are you astonished?”  Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I be astonished?”  “You approve?”  Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I not approve?”  “Well!” said his friend Stryver, “you take it more easily than I fancied you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. Yes, Sydney, I have had enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it; I feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels inclined to go to it (when he doesn’t, he can stay away), and I feel that Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me credit. So I have made up my mind. And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to say a word to you about your prospects.You are in a bad way, you know; you really are in a bad way. You don’t know the value of  money, you live hard, you’ll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor; you really ought to think about a nurse.”  The prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look twice as big as he was, and four times as offensive.  “Now, let me recommend you,” pursued Stryver, “to look it in the face. I have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the face, you, in your different way. Marry. Provide somebody to take care of you. Never mind your having no enjoyment of women’s society, nor understanding of it, nor tact for it. Find out somebody. Find out some respectable woman with a little property—somebody in the landlady way, or lodging-letting way—and marry her, against a rainy day. That’s the kind of thing for you . Now, think of it, Sydney.”  “I’ll think of it,” said Sydney. \n\n CHAPTER 12  The Fellow of Delicacy  M r. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good fortune on the Doctor’s daughter, resolved to make her happiness known to her before he left town for the Long Vacation. After some mental debating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would be as well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two before Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it and Hilary.  As to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly saw his way to the verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial worldly grounds—the only grounds ever worth taking into account—it was a plain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He called himself for the plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for the defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to consider. After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer case could be.  Accordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to Ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present himself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind.  Towards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple, while the bloom of the Long Vacation’s infancy was still upon it. Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet on Saint Dunstan’s side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown way along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have seen how safe and strong he was.  His way taking him past Tellson’s, and he both banking at Tellson’s and knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr. Stryver’s mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness of the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr. Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything under the clouds were a sum.  “Halloa!” said Mr. Stryver. “How do you do? I hope you are well?”  It was Stryver’s grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any place, or space. He was so much too big for Tellson’s, that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he squeezed them against the wall.The House itself, magnificently reading the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.  The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would recommend under the circumstances, “How do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do you do, sir?” and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in his manner of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson’s who shook hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He shook in a self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.  “Can I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?” asked Mr. Lorry, in his business character.  “Why, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I have come for a private word.”  “Oh indeed!” said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed to the House afar off.  “I am going,” said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidently on the desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to be not half desk enough for him: “I am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.”  “Oh dear me!” cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his visitor dubiously.  “Oh dear me, sir?” repeated Stryver, drawing back. “Oh dear you, sir? What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?”  “My meaning,” answered the man of business, “is, of course, friendly and appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and—in short, my meaning is everything you could desire. But—really, you know, Mr. Stryver—” Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally, “you know there really is so much too much of you!”  “Well!” said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand, opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, “if I understand you, Mr. Lorry, I’ll be hanged!”  Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards the end, and bit the feather of a pen.  “D—n it all, sir!” said Stryver, staring at him, “am I not eligible?”  “Oh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you’re eligible!” said Mr. Lorry. “If you say eligible, you are eligible.”  “Am I not prosperous?” asked Stryver.  “Oh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,” said Mr. Lorry.  “And advancing?”  “If you come to advancing, you know,” said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be able to make another admission, “nobody can doubt that.”  “Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?” demanded Stryver, perceptibly crestfallen.  “Well! I—Were you going there now?” asked Mr. Lorry.  “Straight!” said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk.  “Then I think I wouldn’t, if I was you.”  “Why?” said Stryver. “Now, I’ll put you in a corner,” forensically shaking a forefinger at him. “You are a man of business and bound to have a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn’t you go?”  “Because,” said Mr. Lorry, “I wouldn’t go on such an object without having some cause to believe that I should succeed.”  \n Mr. Stryver at Tellson’s Bank \n![011](bano_9781411433236_oeb_011_r1.jpg)\n “D—n ME!” cried Stryver, “but this beats everything.”  Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry Stryver.  “Here’s a man of business—a man of years—a man of experience— in a Bank,” said Stryver; “and having summed up three leading reasons for complete success, he says there’s no reason at all! Says it with his head on!” Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.  “When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady. The young lady, my good sir,” said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, “the young lady. The young lady goes before all.”  “Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,” said Stryver, squaring his elbows, “that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present in question is a mincing Fool?”  “Not exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,” said Mr. Lorry, reddening, “that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady from any lips; and that if I knew any man—which I hope I do not—whose taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could not restrain himself from speaking disre spectfully of that young lady at this desk, not even Tellson’s should prevent my giving him a piece of my mind.”  The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver’s blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry; Mr. Lorry’s veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in no better state now it was his turn.  “That is what I mean to tell you, sir,” said Mr. Lorry. “Pray let there be no mistake about it.”  Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:  “This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not to go up to Soho and offer myself— my self, Stryver of the King’s Bench bar?”  “Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?”  “Yes, I do.”  “Very good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.”  “And all I can say of it is,” laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, “that this—ha, ha!—beats everything past, present, and to come.”  “Now understand me,” pursued Mr. Lorry. “As a man of business, I am not justified in saying anything about this matter for, as a man of business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have spoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I may not be right?”  “Not I!” said Stryver, whistling. “I can’t undertake to find third parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It’s new to me, but you are right, I dare say.”  “What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself. And understand me, sir,” said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, “I will not—not even at Tellson’s—have it characterised for me by any gentleman breathing.”  “There! I beg your pardon!” said Stryver.  “Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:—it might be painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with the family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is best spared. What do you say?”  “How long would you keep me in town?”  “Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.”  “Then I say yes,” said Stryver: “I won’t go up there now, I am not so hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look in to-night. Good-morning.”  Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up  against it bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength of the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in the empty office until they bowed another customer in.  The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than moral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to swallow, he got it down. “And now,” said Mr. Stryver, shaking his forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, “my way out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.”  It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found great relief. “You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,” said Mr. Stryver; “I’ll do that for you.”  Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o’clock, Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of the morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.  “Well!” said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of bootless attempts to bring him round to the question. “I have been to Soho.”  “To Soho?” repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. “Oh, to be sure! What am I thinking of!”  “And I have no doubt,” said Mr. Lorry, “that I was right in the conversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my advice.”  “I assure you,” returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, “that I am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father’s account. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let us say no more about it.”  “I don’t understand you,” said Mr. Lorry.  “I dare say not,” rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and final way; “no matter, no matter.”  “But it does matter,” Mr. Lorry urged.  “No it doesn’t; I assure you it doesn’t. Having supposed that there was sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm  is done.Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view—it is hardly necessary to say I could have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you will always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you, I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account. And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you, and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do; you were right, it never would have done.”  Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr. Stryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head. “Make the best of it, my dear sir,” said Stryver; “say no more about it; thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good-night!”  Mr. Lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was. Mr. Stryver was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling. \n\n CHAPTER 13  The Fellow of No Delicacy  I f Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the house of Doctor Manette. He had been there often, during a whole year, and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. When he cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing, which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely pierced by the light within him.  And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that  house, and for the senseless stones that made their pavements. Many a night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable, into his mind. Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known him more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that neighbourhood.  On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal that “he had thought better of that marrying matter”) had carried his delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney’s feet still trod those stones. From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became animated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention, they took him to the Doctor’s door.  He was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. She had never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table. But, looking up at his face in the interchange of the first few commonplaces, she observed a change in it.  “I fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!”  “No. But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health. What is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?”  “Is it not—forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips—a pity to live no better life?”  “God knows it is a shame!”  “Then why not change it?”  Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes. There were tears in his voice too, as he answered:  “It is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall sink lower, and be worse.”  He leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand. The table trembled in the silence that followed.  She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew her to be so, without looking at her, and said:  “Pray forgive me, Miss Manette. I break down before the knowledge of what I want to say to you. Will you hear me?”  “If it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier, it would make me very glad!”  “God bless you for your sweet compassion!”  He unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily.  “Don’t be afraid to hear me. Don’t shrink from anything I say. I am like one who died young. All my life might have been.”  “No, Mr. Carton. I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself.”  “Say of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better—although in the mystery of my own wretched heart I know better—I shall never forget it!”  She was pale and trembling. He came to her relief with a fixed despair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have been holden.  “If it has been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the love of the man you see before you—self-flung away, wasted, drunken, poor creature of misuse as you know him to be—he would have been conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he would bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you, disgrace you, pull you down with him. I know very well that you can have no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that it cannot be.”  “Without it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall you—forgive me again!—to a better course? Can I in no way repay your confidence? I know this is a confidence,” she modestly said, after a little hesitation, and in earnest tears, “I know you would say this to no one else. Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr. Carton?”  He shook his head.  “To none. No, Miss Manette, to none. If you will hear me through a very little more, all you can ever do for me is done. I wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul. In my degradation I have not been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this home made such a home by you, has stirred old  shadows that I thought had died out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever. I have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight. A dream, all a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down, but I wish you to know that you inspired it.”  “Will nothing of it remain? O Mr. Carton, think again! Try again!”  “No, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite undeserving. And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me, heap of ashes that I am, into fire—a fire, however, inseparable in its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no service, idly burning away.”  “Since it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more unhappy than you were before you knew me—”  “Don’t say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if anything could.You will not be the cause of my becoming worse.”  “Since the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events, attributable to some influence of mine—this is what I mean, if I can make it plain—can I use no influence to serve you? Have I no power for good, with you, at all?”  “The utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come here to realise. Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life, the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world; and that there was something left in me at this time which you could deplore and pity.”  “Which I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!”  “Entreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved myself, and I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will you let me believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there alone, and will be shared by no one?”  “If that will be a consolation to you, yes.”  “Not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?”  “Mr. Carton,” she answered, after an agitated pause, “the secret is yours, not mine; and I promise to respect it.”  “Thank you. And again, God bless you.”  He put her hand to his lips, and moved towards the door.  “Be under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this conversation by so much as a passing word. I will never refer to it again. If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth. In the hour of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance—and shall thank and bless you for it—that my last avowal of myself was made to you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried in your heart. May it otherwise be light and happy!”  He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was so sad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every day kept down and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him as he stood looking back at her.  “Be comforted!” he said, “I am not worth such feeling, Miss Manette. An hour or two hence, and the low companions and low habits that I scorn but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those, than any wretch who creeps along the streets. Be comforted! But, within myself, I shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though outwardly I shall be what you have heretofore seen me. The last supplication but one I make to you, is, that you will believe this of me.”  “I will, Mr. Carton.”  “My last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve you of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and between whom and you there is an impassable space. It is useless to say it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one thing. The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new ties will be formed about you—ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly to the home you so adorn—the dearest ties that will ever grace and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a happy father’s face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright  beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!”  He said, “Farewell!” said “A last God bless you!” and left her. \n\n CHAPTER 14  The Honest Tradesman  T o the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in  Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and variety of objects in movement were every day presented. Who could sit upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun, both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes down!  With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams, like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty watching one stream —saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind, since a small part of his income was derived from the pi lotage of timid women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from Tellson’s side of the tides to the opposite shore. Brief as such companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her very good health. And it was from the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent purpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed.  Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in the sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place, but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.  It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs. Cruncher must have been “flopping” in some pointed manner, when    an unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his attention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this funeral, which engendered uproar.  \n The Spy’s Funeral \n![012](bano_9781411433236_oeb_012_r1.jpg)\n “Young Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, “it’s a buryin’.”  “Hooroar, father!” cried Young Jerry.  The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.  “What d’ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to conwey to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting too many for me !” said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. “Him and his hooroars! Don’t let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me. D’ye hear?”  “I warn’t doing no harm,”Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.  “Drop it then,” said Mr. Cruncher; “I won’t have none of your no harms. Get atop of that there seat, and look at the crowd.”  His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were considered essential to the dignity of the position. The position appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and incessantly groaning and calling out: “Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!” with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.  Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed Tellson’s. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:  “What is it, brother? What’s it about?”  “ I don’t know,” said the man. “Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!”  He asked another man. “Who is it?”  “ I don’t know,” returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest ardour, “Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi-ies!”  At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the funeral of one Roger Cly.  “Was He a spy?” asked Mr. Cruncher.  “Old Bailey spy,” returned his informant. “Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey Spi-i-es!”  “Why, to be sure!” exclaimed Jerry, recalling a Trial at which he had assisted. “I’ve seen him. Dead, is he?”  “Dead as mutton,” returned the other, “and can’t be too dead. Have ’em out, there! Spies! Pull ’em out, there! Spies!”  The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea, that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the suggestion to have ’em out, and to pull ’em out, mobbed the two vehicles so closely that they came to a stop. On the crowd’s opening the coach doors, the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in their hands for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time, that in another moment he was scouring away up a by-street, after shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchiefs and other symbolical tears.  These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded. They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions being much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out, while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these volunteers was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from the observation of Tellson’s, in the further corner of the mourning coach.  The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief.The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the hearse—advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under close inspection, for the purpose—and with a pieman, also attended by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bear-leader, a popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to that part of the procession in which he walked.  Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally, accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and highly to its own satisfaction.  The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase was given to some score of inoffensive persons who had never been near the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual progress of a mob.  Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers. The place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from a neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot.  “Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way, “you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he was a young ’un and a straight made ’un.”  Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his station at Tellson’s. Whether his meditations on morality had touched his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at  all amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon his medical adviser—a distinguished surgeon—on his way back.  Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No job in his absence.The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea.  “Now, I tell you where it is!” said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on entering. “If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I shall make sure that you’ve been praying again me, and I shall work you for it just the same as if I seen you do it.”  The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.  “Why, you’re at it afore my face!” said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of angry apprehension.  “I am saying nothing.”  “Well, then; don’t meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate.You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether.”  “Yes, Jerry.”  “Yes, Jerry,” repeated Mr. Cruncher, sitting down to tea. “Ah! It is yes, Jerry. That’s about it. You may say yes, Jerry.”  Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corrobo rations, but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general ironical dissatisfaction.  “You and your yes, Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer. “Ah! I think so. I believe you.”  “You are going out to-night?” asked his decent wife, when he took another bite.  “Yes, I am.”  “May I go with you, father?” asked his son, briskly.  “No, you mayn’t. I’m a going—as your mother knows—a fishing. That’s where I’m going to. Going a fishing.”  “Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don’t it, father?”  “Never you mind.”  “Shall you bring any fish home, father?”  “If I don’t, you’ll have short commons, to-morrow,” returned that gentleman, shaking his head; “that’s questions enough for you; I ain’t a going out, till you’ve been long a-bed.”  He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions to his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. The de voutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. It was as if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.  “And mind you!” said Mr. Cruncher. “No games to-morrow! If I, as a honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring on water. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly customer to you, if you don’t. I’m your Rome, you know.”  Then he began grumbling again:  “With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink! I don’t know how scarce you mayn’t make the wittles and drink here, by your flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy: he is you’rn, ain’t he? He’s as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a mother, and not know that a mother’s first duty is to blow her boy out?”  This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother to perform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.  Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions, obeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one o’clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair, took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about him in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher, extinguished the light, and went out.  Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to bed, was not long after his father. Under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the court, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the door stood ajar all night.  Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his father’s honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house-fronts, walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his honoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had not gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and the two trudged on together.  Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here—and that so silently, that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the second follower of the gentle raft to have, all of a sudden, split himself in two.  The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which the wall—there, risen to some eight or ten feet high—formed one side. Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate. He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay there a little—listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands and knees.  It was now Young Jerry’s turn to approach the gate: which he did, holding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass, and all the gravestones in the church-yard—it was a large churchyard that they were in—looking on like ghosts in white, while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They did not creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to fish.  They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great cork-screw.  Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off, with his hair as stiff as his father’s.  But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. They were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew what it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.  He would not have stopped then for anything less necessary than breath, it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him and hopping on at his side—perhaps taking his arm—it was a pursuer to shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boy’s-Kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road, and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then it would not leave him, but followed him up-stairs with a bump on every stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on his breast as he fell asleep.  From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head board of the bed.  “I told you I would,” said Mr. Cruncher, “and I did.”  “Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!” his wife implored.  “You oppose yourself to the profit of the business,” said Jerry, “and me and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil don’t you?”  “I try to be a good wife, Jerry,” the poor woman protested, with tears.  “Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband’s business? Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?”  “You hadn’t taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry.”  “It’s enough for you,” retorted Mr. Cruncher, “to be the wife of a honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations when he took to his trade or when he didn’t. A honouring and obeying wife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious woman? If you’re a religious woman, give me a irreligious one! You have no more nat’ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.”  The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in the honest tradesman’s kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying down at his length on the floor. After taking a timid peep at him lying on his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his son lay down too, and fell asleep again.  There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr. Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his ostensible calling.  Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father’s side along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day, and his qualms were gone with the night—in which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London, that fine morning.  “Father,” said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to  keep at arm’s length and to have the stool well between them: “what’s a Resurrection-Man?”  Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, “How should I know?”  “I thought you knowed everything, father,” said the artless boy.  “Hem! Well,” returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play, “he’s a tradesman.”  “What’s his goods, father?” asked the brisk Young Jerry.  “His goods,” said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, “is a branch of Scientific goods.”  “Persons’ bodies, ain’t it, father?” asked the lively boy.  “I believe it is something of that soil,” said Mr. Cruncher.  “Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I’m quite growed up!”  Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way. “It depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and there’s no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for.” As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance, to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to himself: “Jerry, you honest tradesman, there’s hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!” \n\n CHAPTER 15  Knitting  T here had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. As early as six o’clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its influence on the mood of those who  drank it was to make them gloomy. No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in the dregs of it.  This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat, and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy looks.  Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.  A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in at every place, high and low, from the king’s palace to the criminal’s gaol. Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long way off.  Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until mid-day. It was high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a mender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two entered the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows.Yet, no one had followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.  “Good-day, gentlemen!” said Monsieur Defarge.  It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited an answering chorus of “Good day!”  “It is bad weather, gentlemen,” said Defarge, shaking his head.  Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went out.  “My wife,” said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge; “I have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called Jacques. I met him—by accident—a day and half’s journey out of Paris. He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to drink, my wife!”  A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before the mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company, and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near Madame Defarge’s counter. A third man got up and went out.  Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine—but, he took less than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no rarity—and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast. He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.  “Have you finished your repast, friend?” he asked, in due season.  “Yes, thank you.”  “Come, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could occupy. It will suit you to a marvel.”  Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a court yard, out of the court-yard up a steep staircase, out of the staircase into a garret,—formerly the garret where a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.  No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall.  Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice: “Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all. Speak, Jacques Five!”  The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with it, and said, “Where shall I commence, monsieur?”  “Commence,” was Monsieur Defarge’s not unreasonable reply, “at the commencement.”  “I saw him then, messieurs,” began the mender of roads, “a year ago this running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he hanging by the chain—like this.”  Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year.  Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before?  “Never,” answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.  Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then.  “By his tall figure,” said the mender of roads, softly, and with his finger at his nose. “When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening, ‘Say, what is he like?’ I make response, ‘Tall as a spectre.’ ”  “You should have said, short as a dwarf,” returned Jacques Two.  “But what did I know. The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger, standing near our little fountain, and says, ‘To me! Bring that rascal!’ My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.”  “He is right there, Jacques,” murmured Defarge, to him who had interrupted. “Go on!”  “Good!” said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. “The tall man is lost, and he is sought—how many months? Nine, ten, eleven?”  “No matter, the number,” said Defarge. “He is well hidden, but at last he is unluckily found. Go on!”  “I am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to go to bed. I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see coming over the hill six soldiers. In the midst of them is a tall man with his arms bound—tied to his sides—like this!”  With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his elbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him.  “I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and that they are almost black to my sight—except on the side of the sun going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants. Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves with them as they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!”  He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.  “I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with our eyes. ‘Come on!’ says the chief of that company, pointing to the village, ‘bring him fast to his tomb!’ and they bring him faster. I follow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his wooden shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. Because he is lame, and consequently slow, they drive him with their guns—like this!”  He imitated the action of a man’s being impelled forward by the butt-ends of muskets.  “As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls. They laugh and pick him up again. His face is bleeding and covered with dust, but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring him into the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill, and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the darkness of the night, and swallow him—like this!”  He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding snap of his teeth. Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again, Defarge said, “Go on, Jacques.”  “All the village,” pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low voice, “withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the locks and  bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it, except to perish. In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on my way to my work. There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He has no hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a dead man.”  Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of all of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the countryman’s story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was authoritative too. They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on his hand, and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally intent, on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand al ways gliding over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge standing between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the light of the window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to him.  “Go on, Jacques,” said Defarge.  “He remains up there in his iron cage some days. The village looks at him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from a distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all faces are turned towards the prison. Formerly, they were turned towards the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison. They whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say that a petition has been presented to the King himself. What do I know? It is possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no.”  “Listen then, Jacques,” Number One of that name sternly interposed. “Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen. All here, yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street, sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in his hand.”  “And once again listen, Jacques!” said the kneeling Number Three: his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something—that was neither food nor drink; “the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner, and struck him blows. You hear?”  “I hear, messieurs.”  “Go on then,” said Defarge.  “Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,” resumed the countryman, “that he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the father of his tenants—serfs—what you will—he will be executed as a parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally, that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That old man says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies? I am not a scholar.”  “Listen once again then, Jacques!” said the man with the restless hand and the craving air. “The name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager attention to the last—to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall, when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! And it was done—why, how old are you?”  “Thirty-five,” said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.  “It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen it.”  “Enough!” said Defarge, with grim impatience. “Long live the Devil! Go on.”  “Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else; even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street. Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the water.”  The mender of roads looked through rather than at the low ceiling, and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.  “All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out, the cows are there with the rest. At midday, the roll of drums. Soldiers have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst of many soldiers. He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is a gag—tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he laughed.” He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs, from the corners of his mouth to his ears. “On the top of the gallows is fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air. He is hanged there forty feet high—and is left hanging, poisoning the water.”  They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face, on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the spectacle.  “It is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children draw water! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under it, have I said? When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church, across the mill, across the prison—seemed to strike across the earth, messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!”  The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other three, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him.  “That’s all, messieurs. I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do), and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was warned I should) this comrade. With him, I came on, now riding and now walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night. And here you see me!”  After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, “Good! You have acted and recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us a little, outside the door?”  “Very willingly,” said the mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted to the top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.  The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came back to the garret.  “How say you, Jacques?” demanded Number One. “To be registered?”  “To be registered, as doomed to destruction,” returned Defarge.  “Magnificent!” croaked the man with the craving.  “The château and all the race?” inquired the first.  “The château and all the race,” returned Defarge. “Extermination.”  The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, “Magnificent!” and began gnawing another finger.  “Are you sure,” asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, “that no embarrassment can arise from our manner of keeping the register? Without doubt it is safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always be able to decipher it—or, I ought to say, will she?”  “Jacques,” returned Defarge, drawing himself up, “if madame my wife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose a word of it—not a syllable of it. Knitted, in her own stitches and her own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun. Confide in Madame Defarge. It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives, to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge.”  There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who hungered, asked: “Is this rustic to be sent back soon? I hope so. He is very simple; is he not a little dangerous?”  “He knows nothing,” said Defarge; “at least nothing more than would easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. I charge myself with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him on his road. He wishes to see the fine world—the King, the Queen, and Court; let him see them on Sunday.”  “What?” exclaimed the hungry man, staring. “Is it a good sign, that he wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?”  “Jacques,” said Defarge; “judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her to thirst for it. Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish him to bring it down one day.”  Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the pallet-bed and take some rest. He needed no persuasion, and was soon asleep.  Worse quarters than Defarge’s wine-shop, could easily have been found in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very new and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her counter, so expressly unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that his being there had any connexion with anything below the surface, that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye  lighted on her. For, he contended with himself that it was impossible to forsee what that lady might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through with it until the play was played out.  Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted (though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur and himself to Versailles. It was additionally disconcerting to have madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the King and Queen.  “You work hard, madame,” said a man near her.  “Yes,” answered Madame Defarge; “I have a good deal to do.”  “What do you make, madame?”  “Many things.”  “For instance—”  “For instance,” returned Madame Defarge, composedly, “shrouds.”  The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the shining Bull’s Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen, Long live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of ubiquitous Jacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, court- yards, terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull’s Eye, more lords and ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept with sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company, and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces.  “Bravo!” said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over, like a patron; “you are a good boy!”  The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no.  “You are the fellow we want,” said Defarge, in his ear, “you make these fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are the more insolent, and it is the nearer ended.”  “Hey!” cried the mender of roads, reflectively; “that’s true.”  “These fools know nothing. While they despise your breath, and would stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath tells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot deceive them too much.”  Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in confirmation.  “As to you,” said she, “you would shout and shed tears for anything, if it made a show and a noise. Say! Would you not?”  “Truly, madame, I think so. For the moment.”  “If you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would pick out the richest and gayest. Say! Would you not?”  “Truly yes, madame.”  “Yes. And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage, you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?”  “It is true, madame.”  “You have seen both dolls and birds to-day,” said Madame Defarge, with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent; “now, go home!” \n\n CHAPTER 16  Still Knitting  M adame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amica bly to the bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where the château of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to the whispering trees. Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now, for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone court-yard and terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces was altered. A rumour just lived in the village—had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had—that when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever. In the stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder was done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which everybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all started away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares who could find a living there.  Château and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the stone floor, and the pure water in the village well—thousands of acres of land—a whole province of France—all France itself—lay under the night sky, concentrated into a faint hair- breadth line. So does a whole world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling star. And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences  may read in the feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every vice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it.  The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight, in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their journey naturally tended. There was the usual stoppage at the barrier guard-house, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual examination and inquiry. Monsieur Defarge alighted: knowing one or two of the soldiery there, and one of the police. The latter he was intimate with, and affectionately embraced.  When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings, and they, having finally alighted near the Saint’s boundaries, were picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:  “Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?”  “Very little to-night, but all he knows. There is another spy commissioned for our quarter. There may be many more, for all that he can say, but he knows of one.”  “Eh well!” said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool business air. “It is necessary to register him. How do they call that man?”  “He is English.”  “So much the better. His name?”  “Barsad,” said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he had been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect correctness.  “Barsad,” repeated madame. “Good. Christian name?”  “John.”  “John Barsad,” repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself. “Good. His appearance; is it known?”  “Age, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair; complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore, sinister.”  “Eh my faith. It is a portrait!” said madame, laughing. “He shall be registered to-morrow.”  They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight) and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted the small moneys that had been taken during her    absence, examined the stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally dismissed him to bed. Then she turned out the contents of the bowl of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the night. All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked up and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which condition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he walked up and down through life.  \n The Wine-shop \n![013](bano_9781411433236_oeb_013_r1.jpg)\n The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. Monsieur Defarge’s olfactory sense was by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed. He whiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down his smoked-out pipe.  “You are fatigued,” said madame, raising her glance as she knotted the money. “There are only the usual odours.”  “I am a little tired,” her husband acknowledged.  “You are a little depressed, too,” said madame, whose quick eyes had never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for him. “Oh, the men, the men!”  “But my dear!” began Defarge.  “But my dear!” repeated madame, nodding firmly; “but my dear! You are faint of heart to-night, my dear!”  “Well, then,” said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his breast, “it is a long time.”  “It is a long time,” repeated his wife; “and when is it not a long time? Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule.”  “It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning,” said Defarge.  “How long,” demanded madame, composedly, “does it take to make and store the lightning? Tell me.”  Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that too.  “It does not take a long time,” said madame, “for an earthquake to swallow a town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the earthquake?”  “A long time, I suppose,” said Defarge.  “But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything before it. In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not seen or heard. That is your consolation. Keep it.”  She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.  “I tell thee,” said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis, “that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it is always advancing. Look around and consider the lives of all the world that we know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider the rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with more and more of certainty every hour. Can such things last? Bah! I mock you.”  “My brave wife,” returned Defarge, standing before her with his head a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and attentive pupil before his catechist, “I do not question all this. But it has lasted a long time, and it is possible—you know well, my wife, it is possible—that it may not come, during our lives.”  “Eh well! How then?” demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there were another enemy strangled.  “Well!” said Defarge, with a half-complaining and half-apologetic shrug. “We shall not see the triumph.”  “We shall have helped it,” returned madame, with her extended hand in strong action. “Nothing that we do, is done in vain. I believe, with all my soul, that we shall see the triumph. But even if not, even if I knew certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I would—”  Then madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.  “Hold!” cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with cowardice; “I too, my dear, will stop at nothing.”  “Yes! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim and your opportunity, to sustain you. Sustain yourself without that. When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the time with the tiger and the devil chained—not shown—yet al ways ready.”  Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.  Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the wine-shop, knitting away assiduously. A rose lay beside her, and if she now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her usual preoccupied air. There were a few customers, drinking or not drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. The day was very hot, and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell dead at the bottom. Their decease made no impression on the other flies out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met the same fate. Curious to consider how heedless flies are!—perhaps they thought as much at Court that sunny summer day.  A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she felt to be a new one. She laid down her knitting, and began to pin her rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure.  It was curious. The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the wine-shop.  “Good day, madame,” said the new comer.  “Good day, monsieur.”  She said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting: “Hah! Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark, thin long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression! Good day, one and all!”  “Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.”  Madame complied with a polite air.  “Marvellous cognac this, madame!”  It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of observing the place in general.  “You knit with great skill, madame.”  “I am accustomed to it.”  “A pretty pattern too!”  “ You think so?” said madame, looking at him with a smile.  “Decidedly. May one ask what it is for?”  “Pastime,” said madame, still looking at him with a smile, while her fingers moved nimbly.  “Not for use?”  “That depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do—well,” said madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry, “I’ll use it!”  It was remarkable; but the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when, catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away. Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there one left. They had all dropped off. The spy had kept his eyes open, but had been able to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and unimpeachable.  “JOHN,” thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted, and her eyes looked at the stranger. “Stay long enough, and I shall knit ‘BARSAD’ before you go.”  “You have a husband, madame?”  “I have.”  “Children?”  “No children.”  “Business seems bad?”  “Business is very bad; the people are so poor.”  “Ah, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too—as you say.”  “As you say,” madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an extra something into his name that boded him no good.  “Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so. Of course.”  “ I think?” returned madame, in a high voice. “I and my husband have enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we think, here, is how to live. That is the subject we think of, and it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about,  without embarrassing our heads concerning others. I think for others? No, no.”  The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but, stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame Defarge’s little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.  “A bad business this, madame, of Gaspard’s execution. Ah! the poor Gaspard!” With a sigh of great compassion.  “My faith!” returned madame, coolly and lightly, “if people use knives for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew beforehand what the price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.”  “I believe,” said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: “I believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor fellow? Between ourselves.”  “Is there?” asked madame, vacantly.  “Is there not?”  “—Here is my husband!” said Madame Defarge.  As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, “Good day, Jacques!” Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.  “Good day, Jacques!” the spy repeated; with not quite so much confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.  “You deceive yourself, monsieur,” returned the keeper of the wine-shop. “You mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge.”  “It is all the same,” said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: “good day!”  “Good day!” answered Defarge, drily.  “I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when you entered, that they tell me there is—and no wonder!—much sympathy and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard.”  “No one has told me so,” said Defarge, shaking his head. “I know nothing of it.”  Having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with  his hand on the back of his wife’s chair, looking over that barrier at the person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would have shot with the greatest satisfaction.  The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh water, and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over it.  “You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?” observed Defarge.  “Not at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants.”  “Hah!” muttered Defarge.  “The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me,” pursued the spy, “that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting associations with your name.”  “Indeed!” said Defarge, with much indifference.  “Yes, indeed. When Dr. Manette was released, you, his old domestic, had the charge of him, I know. He was delivered to you. You see I am informed of the circumstances?”  “Such is the fact, certainly,” said Defarge. He had had it conveyed to him, in an accidental touch of his wife’s elbow as she knitted and warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.  “It was to you,” said the spy, “that his daughter came; and it was from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown monsieur; how is he called?—in a little wig—Lorry—of the bank of Tellson and Company—over to England.”  “Such is the fact,” repeated Defarge.  “Very interesting remembrances!” said the spy. “I have known Dr. Manette and his daughter, in England.”  “Yes?” said Defarge.  “You don’t hear much about them now?” said the spy.  “No,” said Defarge.  “In effect,” madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little song, “we never hear about them. We received the news of their safe arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then, they have gradually taken their road in life—we, ours—and we have held no correspondence.”  “Perfectly so, madame,” replied the spy. “She is going to be married.”  “Going?” echoed madame. “She was pretty enough to have been married long ago. You English are cold, it seems to me.”  “Oh! You know I am English.”  “I perceive your tongue is,” returned madame; “and what the tongue is, I suppose the man is.”  He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his cognac to the end, he added:  “Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah, poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that she is going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is Mr. Charles Darnay. D’Aulnais is the name of his mother’s family.”  Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her husband. Do what he would, behind the little counter, as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy. The spy would have been no spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.  Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say, in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should come back.  “Can it be true,” said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his wife as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: “what he has said of Ma’amselle Manette?”  “As he has said it,” returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little, “it is probably false. But it may be true.”  “If it is—” Defarge began, and stopped.  “If it is?” repeated his wife.  “—And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph—I hope, for her sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France.”  “Her husband’s destiny,” said Madame Defarge, with her usual composure, “will take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end that is to end him. That is all I know.”  “But it is very strange—now, at least, is it not very strange”—said Defarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it, “that, after all our sympathy for Monsieur her father, and herself, her husband’s name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by the side of that infernal dog’s who has just left us?”  “Stranger things than that will happen when it does come,” answered madame. “I have them both here, of a certainty; and they are both here for their merits; that is enough.”  She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words, and presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head. Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its disappearance; howbeit, the Saint took courage to lounge in, very shortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect.  In the evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window- ledges, and came to the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place to place and from group to group: a Missionary—there were many like her—such as the world will do well never to breed again. All the women knitted. They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the jaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still, the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched.  But, as the fingers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts. And as Madame Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with, and left behind.  Her husband smoked at his door, looking after her with admiration. “A great woman,” said he, “a strong woman, a grand woman, a frightfully grand woman!”  Darkness closed around, and then came the ringing of church  bells and the distant beating of the military drums of the Royal Guard, as the women sat knitting, knitting. Darkness encompassed them. Another darkness was closing in as surely, when the church bells, then ringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be melted into thundering cannon; when the military drums should be beating to drown a wretched voice, that night all potent as the voice of Power and Plenty, Freedom and Life. So much was closing in about the women who sat knitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing in around a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting, knitting, counting dropping heads. \n\n CHAPTER 17  One Night  N ever did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in Soho, than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat under the plane-tree together. Never did the moon rise with a milder radiance over great London, than on that night when it found them still seated under the tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves.  Lucie was to be married to-morrow. She had reserved this last evening for her father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree.  “You are happy, my dear father?”  “Quite, my child.”  They had said little, though they had been there a long time. When it was yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself in her usual work nor had she read to him. She had employed herself in both ways, at his side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this time was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so.  “And I am very happy to-night, dear father. I am deeply happy in the love that Heaven has so blessed—my love for Charles, and Charles’s love for me. But, if my life were not to be still consecrated  to you, or if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by the length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and self-reproachful now than I can tell you. Even as it is—”  Even as it was, she could not command her voice.  In the sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face upon his breast. In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of the sun itself is—as the light called human life is—at its coming and its going.  “Dearest dear! Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite, quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will ever interpose between us? I know it well, but do you know it? In your own heart, do you feel quite certain?”  Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could scarcely have assumed, “Quite sure, my darling! More than that,” he added, as he tenderly kissed her: “my future is far brighter, Lucie, seen through your marriage, than it could have been—nay, than it ever was—without it.”  “If I could hope that , my father!—”  “Believe it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how plain it is, my dear, that it should be so.You, devoted and young, cannot fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be wasted—”  She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated the word.  “—wasted, my child—should not be wasted, struck aside from the natural order of things—for my sake. Your unselfishness cannot entirely comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself, how could my happiness be perfect. while yours was incomplete?”  “If I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy with you.”  He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without Charles, having seen him, and replied:  “My child, you did see him, and it is Charles. If it had not been Charles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I should have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.”  It was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him refer to the period of his suffering. It gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long afterwards.  “See!” said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the moon. “I have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not bear her light. I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against my prison-walls. I have looked at her, in a state so dull and lethargic, that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I could draw across her at the full, the number of perpendicular lines with which I could intersect them.” He added in his inward and pondering manner, as he looked at the moon, “It was twenty either way, I remember, and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in.”  The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time, deepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in the manner of his reference. He only seemed to contrast his present cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.  “I have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn child from whom I had been rent. Whether it was alive. Whether it had been born alive, or the poor mother’s shock had killed it. Whether it was a son who would some day avenge his father. (There was a time in my imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.) Whether it was a son who would never know his father’s story; who might even live to weigh the possibility of his father’s having disappeared of his own will and act. Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman.”  She drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand.  “I have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of me—rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have cast up the years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married to a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from the remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a blank.”  “My father! Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child.”  “You, Lucie? It is out of the consolation and restoration you have  brought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and the moon on this last night.—What did I say just now?”  “She knew nothing of you. She cared nothing for you.”  “So! But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different way—have affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its foundations could—I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have seen her image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held her in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door. But, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?”  “The figure was not; the—the—image; the fancy?”  “No. That was another thing. It stood before my disturbed sense of sight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued, was another and more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no more than that she was like her mother. The other had that likeness too—as you have—but was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie? Hardly, I think? I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these perplexed distinctions.”  His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running cold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition.  “In that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight, coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture was in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active, cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all.”  “I was that child, my father. I was not half so good, but in my love that was I.”  “And she showed me her children,” said the Doctor of Beauvais, “and they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me. When they passed a prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked up at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never deliver me; I imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things. But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and blessed her.”  “I am that child, I hope, my father. O my dear, my dear, will you bless me as fervently to-morrow?”  “Lucie. I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my great happiness. My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near the happiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us.”  He embraced her, solemnly commended her to Heaven, and humbly thanked Heaven for having bestowed her on him. By-and-by, they went into the house.  There was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was even to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross. The marriage was to make no change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it, by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.  Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. They were only three at table, and Miss Pross made the third. He regretted that Charles was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.  So, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated. But, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came down stairs again, and stole into his room: not free from un-shaped fears, beforehand.  All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay asleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his hands lying quiet on the coverlet. She put her needless candle in the shadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his; then, leaned over him, and looked at him.  Into his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held the mastery of them, even in his sleep. A more remarkable face in its quiet, resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.  She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer that she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his sorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his  lips once more, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves of the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved in praying for him. \n\n CHAPTER 18  Nine Days  T he marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the closed door of the Doctor’s room, where he was speaking with Charles Darnay. They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross—to whom the event, through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss, but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should have been the bridegroom.  “And so,” said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride, and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet, pretty dress; “and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought you across the Channel, such a baby! Lord bless me! How little I thought what I was doing. How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring on my friend Mr. Charles!”  “You didn’t mean it,” remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, “and therefore how could you know it? Nonsense!”  “Really? Well; but don’t cry,” said the gentle Mr. Lorry.  “I am not crying,” said Miss Pross; “ you are.”  “I, my Pross?” (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her, on occasion.)  “You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don’t wonder at it. Such a present of plate as you have made ’em, is enough to bring tears into anybody’s eyes. There’s not a fork or a spoon in the collection,” said Miss Pross, “that I didn’t cry over, last night after the box came, till I couldn’t see it.”  “I am highly gratified,” said Mr. Lorry, “though, upon my honour, I had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance, invisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that  makes a man speculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there might have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!”  “Not at all!” From Miss Pross.  “You think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?” asked the gentleman of that name.  “Pooh!” rejoined Miss Pross; “you were a bachelor in your cradle.”  “Well!” observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, “that seems probable, too.”  “And you were cut out for a bachelor,” pursued Miss Pross, “before you were put in your cradle.”  “Then, I think,” said Mr. Lorry, “that I was very unhandsomely dealt with, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my pattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie,” drawing his arm soothingly round her waist, “I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson’s shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at the fortnight’s end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on your other fortnight’s trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now I hear Somebody’s step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his own.”  For a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright golden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.  The door of the Doctor’s room opened, and he came out with Charles Darnay. He was so deadly pale—which had not been the case when they went in together—that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face. But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold wind.  He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her downstairs to the  chariot which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. The rest followed in another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church where no strange eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.  Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling, glanced on the bride’s hand, which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry’s pockets. They returned home to breakfast, and all went well, and in due course, the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker’s white locks in the Paris garret, were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the door at parting.  It was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms, “Take her, Charles! She is yours!” And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was gone.  The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted there, had struck him a poisoned blow.  He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But, it was the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.  “I think,” he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, “I think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him. I must look in at Tellson’s; so I will go there at once and come back presently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine there, and all will be well.”  It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson’s, than to look out of Tellson’s. He was detained two hours. When he came back he ascended the old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant;  going thus into the Doctor’s rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.  “Good God!” he said, with a start. “What’s that?”  Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. “O me, O me! All is lost!” cried she, wringing her hands. “What is to be told to Ladybird? He doesn’t know me, and is making shoes!”  Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the Doctor’s room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent down, and he was very busy.  “Doctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!”  The Doctor looked at him for a moment—half inquiringly, half as if he were angry at being spoken to—and bent over his work again.  He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked hard—impatiently—as if in some sense of having been interrupted.  Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by him, and asked what it was?  “A young lady’s walking shoe,” he muttered, without looking up. “It ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.”  “But, Doctor Manette. Look at me!”  He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in his work.  “You know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper occupation. Think, dear friend!”  Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract a word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on the air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. In that, there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity—as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.  Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from    Lucie; the second that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a few days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been addressed to her by the same post.  \n The Accomplices \n![014](bano_9781411433236_oeb_014_r1.jpg)\n These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he thought the best, on the Doctor’s case.  In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson’s for the first time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same room.  He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He abandoned that attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep him self always before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat near the window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.  Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on, that first day, until it was too dark to see—worked on, half an hour after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write. When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose and said to him:  “Will you go out?”  He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner, looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:  “Out?”  “Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?”  He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But, Mr. Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the  dusk, with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in some misty way asking himself, “Why not?” The sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.  Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room. He paced up and down for a long time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he fell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his bench and to work.  On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name, and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and that he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day; at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing amiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry’s friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him.  When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:  “Dear Doctor, will you go out?”  As before, he repeated, “Out?”  “Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?”  This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In the meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry’s return, he slipped away to his bench.  The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry’s hope darkened, and his heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day. The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six days, seven days, eight days, nine days.  With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret was well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at  first, was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in the dusk of the ninth evening. \n\n CHAPTER 19  An Opinion  W orn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night.  He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had done so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the Doctor’s room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker’s bench and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading at the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly studious and attentive.  Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?  It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there? How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Dr. Manette’s consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the Doctor’s bedroom door in the early morning?  Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none. He  advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr. Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.  Miss Pross submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked out with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual white linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the usual way, and came to breakfast.  So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe advance, he at first supposed that his daughter’s marriage had taken place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however, he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid he sought. And that aid was his own.  Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:  “My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less so.”  Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced at his hands more than once.  “Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the arm, “the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake—and above all, for his daughter’s—his daughter’s, my dear Manette.”  “If I understand,” said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, “some mental shock—?”  “Yes!”  “Be explicit,” said the Doctor. “Spare no detail.”  Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.  “My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock, of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings, the—the— as you express it—the mind. The mind. It is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there are no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace himself—as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately, there has been”—he paused and took a deep breath—“a slight relapse.”  The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, “Of how long duration?”  “Nine days and nights.”  “How did it show itself? I infer,” glancing at his hands again, “in the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?”  “That is the fact.”  “Now, did you ever see him,” asked the Doctor, distinctly and collectedly, though in the same low voice, “engaged in that pursuit originally?”  “Once.”  “And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects—or in all respects—as he was then?”  “I think in all respects.”  “You spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?”  “No. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her. It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.”  The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, “That was very kind. That was very thoughtful!” Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of the two spoke for a little while.  “Now, my dear Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most considerate and most affectionate way, “I am a mere man of business, and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of intelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this relapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it  be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come about at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine, if I knew how. But I don’t know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity, knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little. Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly, and teach me how to be a little more useful.”  Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and Mr. Lorry did not press him.  “I think it probable,” said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort, “that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite unforeseen by its subject.”  “Was it dreaded by him?” Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.  “Very much.” He said it with an involuntary shudder. “You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer’s mind, and how difficult—how almost impossible—it is, for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.”  “Would he,” asked Mr. Lorry, “be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on him?”  “I think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even believe it—in some cases—to be quite impossible.”  “Now,” said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctor’s arm again, after a short silence on both sides, “to what would you refer this attack?”  “I believe,” returned Doctor Manette, “that there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations would be recalled—say, under certain circumstances—say, on a particular occasion. He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it.”  “Would he remember what took place in the relapse?” asked Mr. Lorry, with natural hesitation.  The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and answered, in a low voice, “Not at all.”  “Now, as to the future,” hinted Mr. Lorry.  “As to the future,” said the Doctor, recovering firmness, “I should have great hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon, I should have great hope. He, yielding under the pressure of a complicated something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against, and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that the worst was over.”  “Well, well! That’s good comfort. I am thankful!” said Mr. Lorry.  “I am thankful!” repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence.  “There are two other points,” said Mr. Lorry, “on which I am anxious to be instructed. I may go on?”  “You cannot do your friend a better service.” The Doctor gave him his hand.  “To the first, then. He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic; he applies himself with a great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. Now, does he do too much?”  “I think not. It may be the character of his mind, to be always in singular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in part, the result of affliction. The less it was occupied with healthy things, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction. He may have observed himself, and made the discovery.”  “You are sure that he is not under too great a strain?”  “I think I am quite sure of it.”  “My dear Manette, if he were overworked now—”  “My dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counter-weight.”  “Excuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a moment, that he was overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder?”  “I do not think so. I do not think,” said Doctor Manette with the firmness of self-conviction, “that anything but the one train of association would renew it. I think that, henceforth, nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. After what has happened, and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again. I trust, and I almost believe, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.”  He spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing would overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal endurance and distress. It was not for his friend to abate that confidence. He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he really was, and approached his second and last point. He felt it to be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning conversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in the last nine days, he knew that he must face it.  “The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from,” said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, “we will call—Blacksmith’s work, Blacksmith’s work. We will say, to put a case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad time, to work at a little forge. We will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again. Is it not a pity that he should keep it by him?”  The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot nervously on the ground.  “He has always kept it by him,” said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious look at his friend. “Now, would it not be better that he should let it go?”  Still, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on the ground.  “You do not find it easy to advise me?” said Mr. Lorry. “I quite understand it to be a nice question. And yet I think—” And there he shook his head, and stopped.  “You see,” said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy pause, “it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings of this poor man’s mind. He once yearned so frightfully for that occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach. Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not find it, gives him a sudden  sense of terror, like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child.”  He looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorry’s face.  “But may not—mind! I ask for information, as a plodding man of business who only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings, and bank-notes—may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of the idea? If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not the fear go with it? In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to keep the forge?”  There was another silence.  “You see, too,” said the Doctor, tremulously, “it is such an old companion.”  “I would not keep it,” said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he gained in firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted. “I would recommend him to sacrifice it. I only want your authority. I am sure it does no good. Come! Give me your authority, like a dear good man. For his daughter’s sake, my dear Manette!”  Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him!  “In her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it. But, I would not take it away while he was present. Let it be removed when he is not there; let him miss his old companion after an absence.”  Mr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended. They passed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored. On the three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth day he went away to join Lucie and her husband. The precaution that had been taken to account for his silence, Mr. Lorry had previously explained to him, and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and she had no suspicions.  On the night of the day on which he left the house, Mr. Lorry went into his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by Miss Pross carrying a light. There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker’s bench to pieces, while Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder—for which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure. The burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient for the purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools, shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden. So wicked do destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds,  that Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross, while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices in a horrible crime. \n\n CHAPTER 20  A Plea  W hen the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to offer his congratulations, was Sydney Carton. They had not been at home many hours, when he presented himself. He was not improved in habits, or in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity about him, which was new to the observation of Charles Darnay.  He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window, and of speaking to him when no one overheard.  “Mr. Darnay,” said Carton, “I wish we might be friends.”  “We are already friends, I hope.”  “You are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don’t mean any fashion of speech. Indeed, when I say I wish we might be friends, I scarcely mean quite that, either.”  Charles Darnay—as was natural—asked him, in all good-humour and good-fellowship, what he did mean?  “Upon my life,” said Carton, smiling, “I find that easier to comprehend in my own mind, than to convey to yours. However, let me try.You remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk than—than usual?”  “I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking.”  “I remember it too. The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me, for I always remember them. I hope it may be taken into account one day, when all days are at an end for me!—Don’t be alarmed; I am not going to preach.”  “I am not at all alarmed. Earnestness in you, is anything but alarming to me.”  “Ah!” said Carton, with a careless wave of his hand, as if he waved that away. “On the drunken occasion in question (one of a large number, as you know), I was insufferable about liking you, and not liking you. I wish you would forget it.”  “I forgot it long ago.”  “Fashion of speech again! But, Mr. Darnay, oblivion is not so easy to me, as you represent it to be to you. I have by no means forgotten it, and a light answer does not help me to forget it.”  “If it was a light answer,” returned Darnay, “I beg your forgiveness for it. I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to my surprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside. I declare to you on the faith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind. Good Heaven, what was there to dismiss! Have I had nothing more important to remember, in the great service you rendered me that day?”  “As to the great service,” said Carton, “I am bound to avow to you, when you speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional clap-trap. I don’t know that I cared what became of you, when I rendered it.—Mind! I say when I rendered it; I am speaking of the past.”  “You make light of the obligation,” returned Darnay, “but I will not quarrel with your light answer.”  “Genuine truth, Mr. Darnay, trust me! I have gone aside from my purpose; I was speaking about our being friends. Now, you know me; you know I am incapable of all the higher and better flights of men. If you doubt it, ask Stryver, and he’ll tell you so.”  “I prefer to form my own opinion, without the aid of his.”  “Well! At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog who has never done any good, and never will.”  “I don’t know that you ‘never will.’ ”  “But I do, and you must take my word for it. Well! If you could endure to have such a worthless fellow, and a fellow of such indifferent reputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might be permitted to come and go as a privileged person here; that I might be regarded as an useless (and I would add, if it were not for the resemblance I detected between you and me, an unornamental), piece of furniture, tolerated for its old service, and taken no notice of. I doubt if I should abuse the permission. It is a hundred to one if I should avail myself of it four times in a year. It would satisfy me, I dare say, to know that I had it.”  “Will you try?”  “That is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have indicated. I thank you, Darnay. I may use that freedom with your name?”  “I think so, Carton, by this time.”  They shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away. Within a minute afterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as ever.  When he was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with Miss Pross, the Doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention of this conversation in general terms, and spoke of Sydney Carton as a problem of carelessness and recklessness. He spoke of him, in short, not bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who saw him as he showed himself.  He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked.  “We are thoughtful to-night!” said Darnay, drawing his arm about her.  “Yes, dearest Charles,” with her hands on his breast, and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him; “we are rather thoughtful to-night, for we have something on our mind to-night.”  “What is it, my Lucie?”  “Will you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not to ask it?”  “Will I promise? What will I not promise to my Love?”  What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him!  “I think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him to-night.”  “Indeed, my own? Why so?”  “That is what you are not to ask me. But I think—I know—he does.”  “If you know it, it is enough.What would you have me do, my Life?”  “I would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and very lenient on his faults when he is not by. I would ask you to believe that he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep wounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding.”  “It is a painful reflection to me,” said Charles Darnay, quite astounded, “that I should have done him any wrong. I never thought this of him.”  “My husband, it is so. I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable now. But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things, even magnanimous things.”  She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man, that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.  “And, O my dearest Love!” she urged, clinging nearer to him, laying her head upon his breast, and raising her eyes to his, “remember how strong we are in our happiness, and how weak he is in his misery!”  The supplication touched him home. “I will always remember it, dear Heart! I will remember it as long as I live.”  He bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and folded her in his arms. If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets, could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of that husband, he might have cried to the night—and the words would not have parted from his lips for the first time—  “God bless her for her sweet compassion!” \n\n CHAPTER 21  Echoing Footsteps  A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where the Doctor lived. Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of years.  At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife, when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be dimmed. For, there was something coming in the echoes,  something light, afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much. Fluttering hopes and doubts—hope, of a love as yet unknown to her; doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight—divided her breast. Among the echoes then, there would arise the sound of footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her eyes, and broke like waves.  That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom.Then, among the advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of her prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming. They came, and the shady house was sunny with a child’s laugh, and the Divine friend of children, to whom in her trouble she has confided hers, seemed to take her child in His arms, as He took the child of old, and made it a sacred joy to her.  Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together, weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds. Her husband’s step was strong and prosperous among them; her father’s firm and equal. Lo, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the plane-tree in the garden!  Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not harsh nor cruel. Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo on a pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiant smile, “Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!” those were not tears all of agony that wetted his young mother’s cheek, as the spirit departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it. Suffer them and forbid them not. They see my Father’s face. O Father, blessed words!  Thus, the rustling of an Angel’s wings got blended with the other echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed murmur—like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore—as the little Lucie, comically studious at the task  of the morning, or dressing a doll at her mother’s footstool, chattered in the tongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her life.  The echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages.  No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother, but her children had a strange sympathy with him—an instinctive delicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms, and he kept his place with her as she grew. The little boy had spoken of him, almost at the last. “Poor Carton! Kiss him for me!”  Mr. Stryver shouldered his way through the law, like some great engine forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend in his wake, like a boat towed astern. As the boat so favoured is usually in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped life of it. But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made it the life he was to lead; and he no more thought of emerging from his state of lion’s jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of rising to be a lion. Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.  These three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of the most offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like three sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to Lucie’s husband: delicately saying, “Halloa! here are three lumps of bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!” The polite rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr. Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account in the training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of the pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow. He was also in the habit of declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to “catch” him, and on the diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him “not to be caught.” Some of his King’s Bench familiars, who were occasionally parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed it him self—which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an originally bad offence, as to justify any such offender’s being carried off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way.  These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until her little daughter was six years old. How near to her heart the echoes of her child’s tread came, and those of her own dear father’s, always active and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband’s, need not be told. Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any waste, was music to her. Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he found her more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of the many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her “What is the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us, as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to have too much to do?”  But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly in the corner all through this space of time. And it was now, about little Lucie’s sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound, as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.  On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr. Lorry came in late, from Tellson’s, and sat him-self down by Lucie and her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place.  “I began to think,” said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, “that I should have to pass the night at Tellson’s. We have been so full of business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to England.”  “That has a bad look,” said Darnay.  “A bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don’t know what reason there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us at Tellson’s are getting old, and we really can’t be troubled out of the ordinary course without due occasion.”  “Still,” said Darnay, “you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is.”  “I know that, to be sure,” assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, “but I am determined to be peevish after my long day’s botheration. Where is Manette?”  “Here he is,” said the Doctor, entering the dark room at the moment.  “I am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings by which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous without reason. You are not going out, I hope?”  “No; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like,” said the Doctor.  “I don’t think I do like, if I may speak my mind. I am not fit to be pitted against you to-night. Is the tea-board still there, Lucie? I can’t see.”  “Of course, it has been kept for you.”  “Thank ye, my dear. The precious child is safe in bed?”  “And sleeping soundly.”  “That’s right; all safe and well! I don’t know why anything should be otherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so put out all day, and I am not as young as I was! My tea, my dear? Thank ye. Now, come and take your place in the circle, and let us sit quiet, and hear the echoes about which you have your theory.”  “Not a theory; it was a fancy.”  “A fancy, then, my wise pet,” said Mr. Lorry, patting her hand. “They are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not? Only hear them!”  \nHeadlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody’s life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red, the footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as the little circle sat in the dark London window.  Saint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the billowy heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun. A tremendous roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest of naked arms struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind: all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no matter how far off.  Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began, through what agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a time, over the heads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the throng could have told; but, muskets were being distributed —so were cartridges, powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes, every weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise. People who could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands to force stones and bricks out of their places in walls. Every pulse and heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat. Every living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it.  As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging circled round Defarge’s wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself, already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms, thrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm another, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.  “Keep near to me, Jacques Three,” cried Defarge; “and do you, Jacques One and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these patriots as you can. Where is my wife?”  “Eh, well! Here you see me!” said madame, composed as ever, but not knitting to-day. Madame’s resolute right hand was occupied with an axe, in place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a pistol and a cruel knife.  “Where do you go, my wife?”  “I go,” said madame, “with you at present. You shall see me at the head of women, by-and-by.”  “Come, then!” cried Defarge, in a resounding voice. “Patriots and friends, we are ready! The Bastille!”  With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave,  depth on depth, and overflowed the city to that point. Alarm-bells ringing, drums beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack begun.  Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. Through the fire and through the smoke—in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him up against a cannon, and on the instant he became a cannonier—Defarge of the wine-shop worked like a manful soldier Two fierce hours.  Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. One drawbridge down! “Work, comrades all, work! Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One Thousand, Jacques Two Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand; in the name of all the Angels or the Devils—which you prefer—work!”Thus Defarge of the wine-shop, still at his gun, which had long grown hot.  “To me, women!” cried madame his wife. “What! We can kill as well as the men when the place is taken!” And to her, with a shrill thirsty cry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and revenge.  Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single drawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers. Slight displacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded. Flashing weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggon-loads of wet straw, hard work at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys, execrations, bravery without stint, boom, smash and rattle, and the furious sounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the single drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers, and still Defarge of the wine-shop at his gun, grown doubly hot by the service of Four fierce hours.  A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley—this dimly perceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it—suddenly the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the wine-shop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer walls, in among the eight great towers surrendered!  So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even to draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been struggling in the surf at the South Sea, until he was landed in the outer court-yard of the Bastille. There, against an angle of a wall,  he made a struggle to look about him. Jacques Three was nearly at his side; Madame Defarge, still heading some of her women, was visible in the inner distance, and her knife was in her hand. Everywhere was tumult, exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding noise, yet furious dumb-show.  “The Prisoners!”  “The Records!”  “The secret cells!”  “The instruments of torture!”  “The Prisoners!”  Of all these cries, and ten thousand incoherencies, “The Prisoners!” was the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in, as if there were an eternity of people, as well as of time and space. When the foremost billows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained undisclosed, Defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of these men—a man with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his hand—separated him from the rest, and got him between him self and the wall.  “Show me the North Tower!” said Defarge. “Quick!”  “I will faithfully,” replied the man, “if you will come with me. But there is no one there.”  “What is the meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?” asked Defarge. “Quick!”  “The meaning, monsieur?”  “Does it mean a captive, or a place of captivity? Or do you mean that I shall strike you dead?”  “Kill him!” croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up.  “Monsieur, it is a cell.”  “Show it me!”  “Pass this way, then.”  Jacques Three, with his usual craving on him, and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed, held by Defarge’s arm as he held by the turnkey’s. Their three heads had been close together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much as they could do to hear one another, even then: so tremendous was the noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the Fortress, and its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases. All  around outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which, occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the air like spray.  Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past hideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps, and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry waterfalls than staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three, linked hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make. Here and there, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by; but, when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a tower, they were alone. Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls and arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only audible to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they had come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.  The turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock, swung the door slowly open, and said, as they all bent their heads and passed in:  “One hundred and five, North Tower!”  There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall, with a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by stooping low and looking up. There was a small chimney, heavily barred across, a few feet within. There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes on the hearth. There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed. There were the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.  “Pass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them,” said Defarge to the turnkey.  The man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his eyes.  “Stop!—Look here, Jacques!”  “A. M.!” croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily.  “Alexandre Manette,” said Defarge in his ear, following the letters with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder. “And here he wrote ‘a poor physician.’ And it was he, without doubt, who scratched a calendar on this stone. What is that in your hand? A crowbar? Give it me!”  He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. He made a  sudden exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten stool and table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.  “Hold the light higher!” he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey. “Look among those fragments with care, Jacques. And see! Here is my knife,” throwing it to him; “rip open that bed, and search the straw. Hold the light higher, you!”  With a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth, and, peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar, and worked at the iron grating across it. In a few minutes, some mortar and dust came dropping down, which he averted his face to avoid; and in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the chimney into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he groped with a cautious touch.  “Nothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?”  “Nothing.”  “Let us collect them together, in the middle of the cell. So! Light them, you!”  The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot. Stooping again to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and retraced their way to the court-yard; seeming to recover their sense of hearing as they came down, until they were in the raging flood once more.  They found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself. Saint Antoine was clamourous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the guard upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the people. Otherwise, the governor would not be marched to the Hôtel de Ville for judgment. Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the people’s blood (suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness) be unavenged.  In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red decoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a woman’s. “See, there is my husband!” she cried, pointing him out. “See Defarge!” She stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and remained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him through the streets, as Defarge and the rest bore him along; remained immovable close to him when he was got near his destination, and began to be struck at from behind; remained immovable  close to him when the long-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him when he dropped dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she put her foot upon his neck, and with her cruel knife—long ready—hewed off his head.  The hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible idea of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do. Saint Antoine’s blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the iron hand was down—down on the steps of the Hôtel de Ville where the governor’s body lay—down on the sole of the shoe of Madame Defarge where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation. “Lower the lamp yonder!” cried Saint Antoine, after glaring round for a new means of death; “here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard!” The swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed on.  The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive up-heaving of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces were yet unknown. The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes, voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.  But, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was in vivid life, there were two groups of faces—each seven in number—so fixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll which bore more memorable wrecks with it. Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried high overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the Last Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits. Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day. Impassive faces, yet with a suspended—not an abolished—expression on them; faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise the dropped lids of the eyes, and bear witness with the bloodless lips, “THOU DIDST IT!”  Seven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the accursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some discovered letters and other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken hearts,—such, and such-like, the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint Antoine escort through the Paris streets in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine. Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay, and keep these feet far out of her life! For, they are headlong, mad, and dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at Defarge’s wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once stained red. \n\n CHAPTER 22  The Sea Still Rises  H aggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers. Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saint’s mercies.The lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them.  Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat, contemplating the wine-shop and the street. In both, there were several knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest nightcap, awry on the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: “I know how hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself; but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to destroy life in you?” Every lean bare arm, that had been without work before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike. The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that they could tear. There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine; the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.  Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was to be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women. One of her sisterhood knitted beside her. The short, rather plump wife of a  starved grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant had already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance.  “Hark!” said The Vengeance. “Listen, then! Who comes?”  As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of the Saint Antoine Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fast-spreading murmur came rushing along.  “It is Defarge,” said madame. “Silence, patriots!”  Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked around him! “Listen, everywhere!” said madame again. “Listen to him!” Defarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and open mouths, formed outside the door; all those within the wine-shop had sprung to their feet.  “Say then, my husband. What is it?”  “News from the other world!”  “How, then?” cried madame, contemptuously. “The other world?”  “Does everybody here recall old Foulon, who told the famished people that they might eat grass, and who died, and went to Hell?”  “Everybody!” from all throats.  “The news is of him. He is among us!”  “Among us!” from the universal throat again. “And dead?”  “Not dead! He feared us so much—and with reason—that he caused himself to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral. But they have found him alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him in. I have seen him but now, on his way to the Hôtel de Ville, a prisoner. I have said that he had reason to fear us. Say all! Had he reason?”  Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he had never known it yet, he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he could have heard the answering cry.  A moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his wife looked steadfastly at one another. The Vengeance stooped, and the jar of a drum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.  “Patriots!” said Defarge, in a determined voice, “are we ready?”  Instantly Madame Defarge’s knife was in her girdle; the drum was beating in the streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic; and The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about her head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to house, rousing the women.  \n The Sea Rises \n![015](bano_9781411433236_oeb_015_r1.jpg)\n The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest. From such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions.Villain Foulon taken, my sister. Old Foulon taken, my mother. Miscreant Foulon taken, my daughter. Then, a score of others ran into the midst of these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon alive. Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass. Foulon who told my old father that he might eat grass, when I had no bread to give him. Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these breasts were dry with want. O mother of God, this Foulon. O Heaven, our suffering. Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon! Husbands, and brothers, and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon, Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from him. With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy, whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men belonging to them from being trampled under foot.  Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon was at the Hôtel de Ville, and might be loosed. Never, if Saint Antoine knew his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women flocked out of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not a human creature in Saint Antoine’s bosom but a few old crones and the wailing children.  No. They were all by this time choking the Hall of Examination where this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and over-flowing into the adjacent open space and streets. The Defarges, husband and wife, The Vengeance, and Jacques Three, were in the press, and at no great distance from him in the Hall.  “See!” cried madame, pointing with her knife. “See the old villain bound with ropes. That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon  his back. Ha, ha! That was well done. Let him eat it now!” Madame put her knife under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play.  The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the clapping of hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of brawl, and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge’s frequent expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at a distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building.  At length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or protection, directly down upon the old prisoner’s head. The favour was too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had stood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had got him!  It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd. Defarge had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly embrace—Madame Defarge had but followed and turned her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied—The Vengeance and Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high perches—when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, “Bring him out! Bring him to the lamp!”  Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, on his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck at, and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through a forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one of the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him go—as a cat might have done to a mouse—and silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready, and while he besought her: the women passionately screeching at him all  the time, and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in his mouth. Once, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.  Nor was this the end of the day’s bad work, for Saint Antoine so shouted and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing when the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of the people’s enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard five hundred strong, in cavalry alone. Saint Antoine wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper, seized him—would have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear Foulon company—set his head and heart on pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day in Wolf-procession through the streets.  Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children, wailing and breadless. Then, the miserable bakers’ shops were beset by long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them again in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in common, afterwards supping at their doors.  Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of most other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them. Fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children; and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and hoped.  It was almost morning, when Defarge’s wine-shop parted with its last knot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife, in husky tones, while fastening the door:  “At last it is come, my dear!”  “Eh well!” returned madame. “Almost.”  Saint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept with her starved grocer, and the drum was at rest. The drum’s was the only  voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. The Vengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and had the same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint Antoine’s bosom. \n\n CHAPTER 23  Fire Rises  T here was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together. The prison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it, but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of them knew what his men would do—beyond this: that it would probably not be what he was ordered.  Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation. Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people. Everything was bowed down, dejected, oppressed, and broken. Habitations, fences, domesticated animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them—all worn out.  Monseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose; nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought things to this. Strange that Creation, designed expressly for Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out! There must be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely! Thus it was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled, and it now  turned and turned with nothing to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable.  But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like it. For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chase—now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness. No. The change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the disappearance of the high-caste, chiseled, and otherwise beatified and beatifying features of Monseigneur.  For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and to dust he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he had it—in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour, and viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now a frequent presence. As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man of almost barbarian aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods.  Such a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in the July weather, as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he could get from a shower of hail.  The man looked at him, looked at the village in the hollow, at the mill, and at the prison on the crag. When he had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had, he said, in a dialect that was just intelligible:  “How goes it, Jacques?”  “All well, Jacques.”  “Touch then!”  They joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones.  “No dinner?”  “Nothing but supper now,” said the mender of roads, with a hungry face.  “It is the fashion,” growled the man. “I meet no dinner anywhere.”  He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and steel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.  “Touch then.” It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time, after observing these operations. They again joined hands.  “To-night?” said the mender of roads.  “To-night,” said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth.  “Where?”  “Here.”  He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village.  “Show me!” said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill.  “See!” returned the mender of roads, with extended finger. “You go down here, and straight through the street, and past the fountain—”  “To the Devil with all that!” interrupted the other, rolling his eye over the landscape. “ I go through no streets and past no fountains. Well?”  “Well! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village.”  “Good. When do you cease to work?”  “At sunset.”  “Will you wake me, before departing? I have walked two nights without resting. Let me finish my pipe, and I shall sleep like a child. Will you wake me?”  “Surely.”  The wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped off his great wooden shoes, and lay down on his back on the heap of stones. He was fast asleep directly.  As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very  poor account. The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen red cap, the rough medley dress of homespun stuff and hairy skins of beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips. Fortified towns with their stockades, guardhouses, gates, trenches, and drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against this figure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no obstacle, tending to centres all over France.  The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the pattering lumps of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing. Then, the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village, roused him.  “Good!” said the sleeper, rising on his elbow. “Two leagues beyond the summit of the hill?”  “About.”  “About. Good!”  The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain, squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village. When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed, as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. A curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle, chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need to ring the tocsin by-and-by.  The night deepened. The trees environing the old château, keeping its solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the court-yard. Four lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all was black again.  But, not for long. Presently, the château began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous. Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front, picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches, and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter. Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.  A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There was spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur Gabelle’s door. “Help, Gabelle! Help, every one!” The tocsin rang impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. The mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the sky. “It must be forty feet high,” said they, grimly; and never moved.  The rider from the château, and the horse in a foam, clattered away through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire; removed from them, a group of soldiers. “Help, gentlemen-officers! The château is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid! Help, help!” The officers looked towards the  soldiers who looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting of lips, “It must burn.”  As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the village was illuminating. The mender of roads, and the two hundred and fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything, occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionary’s part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with, and that post-horses would roast.  The château was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the rising and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake and contending with the fire.  The château burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire, scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next destination. The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and, abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy.  Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxes—though it was but a small instalment of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter days—became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his house, summoned him to come forth for personal  conference. Whereupon, Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys: this time resolved, if his door was broken in (he was a small Southern man of retaliative temperament), to pitch him self head foremost over the parapet, and crush a man or two below.  Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the distant château for fire and candle, and the beating at his door, combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate, which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour. A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed, and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that while.  Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they had been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up in their turn. But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West, North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned. The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it, no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate successfully. \n\n CHAPTER 24  Drawn to the Loadstone Rock  I n such risings of fire and risings of sea—the firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was al ways on the flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shore—three years of tempest were consumed. Three more birthdays of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home.  Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet. For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted in.  Monseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his not being appreciated: of his being so little wanted in France, as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it, and this life together. Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with infinite pains, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could ask the Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so, Monseigneur, after boldly reading the Lord’s Prayer backwards for a great number of years, and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One, no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels.  The shining Bull’s Eye of the Court was gone, or it would have been the mark for a hurricane of national bullets. It had never been a good eye to see with—had long had the mote in it of Lucifer’s pride, Sardanapalus’s luxury, and a mole’s blindness—but it had dropped out and was gone. The Court, from the exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was all gone together. Royalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and “suspended,” when the last tidings came over.  The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was come, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide.  As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of Monseigneur, in London, was Tellson’s Bank. Spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be. Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most to be relied upon, came quickest. Again: Tellson’s was a munificent house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate. Again: those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made provident remittances to Tellson’s, were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren. To which it must be added that every new comer from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson’s, almost as a matter of course. For such variety of reasons, Tellson’s was at that time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in consequences so numerous, that Tellson’s sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran through Temple Bar to read.  On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and Charles Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice. The penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now the news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing. It was within half an hour or so of the time of closing.  “But, although you are the youngest man that ever lived,” said Charles Darnay, rather hesitating, “I must still suggest to you—”  “I understand. That I am too old?” said Mr. Lorry.  “Unsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you.”  “My dear Charles,” said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, “you touch some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away. It is safe enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon four-score when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with. As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our House here to our House there, who knows the city and the business, of old, and is in Tellson’s confidence. As to the uncertain travelling, the long journey, and the winter weather, if  I were not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson’s, after all these years, who ought to be?”  “I wish I were going myself,” said Charles Darnay, somewhat restlessly, and like one thinking aloud.  “Indeed! You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!” exclaimed Mr. Lorry. “You wish you were going yourself? And you a Frenchman born? You are a wise counsellor.”  “My dear Mr. Lorry, it is because I am a Frenchman born, that the thought (which I did not mean to utter here, however) has passed through my mind often. One cannot help thinking, having had some sympathy for the miserable people, and having abandoned something to them,” he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner, “that one might be listened to, and might have the power to persuade to some restraint. Only last night, after you had left us, when I was talking to Lucie—”  “When you were talking to Lucie,” Mr. Lorry repeated. “Yes. I wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie! Wishing you were going to France at this time of day!”  “However, I am not going,” said Charles Darnay, with a smile. “It is more to the purpose that you say you are.”  “And I am, in plain reality. The truth is, my dear Charles,” Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and lowered his voice, “you can have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved. The Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers of people, if some of our documents were seized or destroyed; and they might be, at any time, you know, for who can say that Paris is not set a-fire to-day, or sacked to morrow! Now, a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise getting of them out of harm’s way, is within the power (without loss of precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one. And shall I hang back, when Tellson’s knows this and says this—Tellson’s, whose bread I have eaten these sixty years—because I am a little stiff about the joints? Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!”  “How I admire the gallantry of your youthful Spirit, Mr. Lorry.”  “Tut! Nonsense, sir—And, my dear Charles,” said Mr. Lorry, glancing at the House again, “you are to remember, that getting things out  of Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an impossibility. Papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here (I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to whisper it, even to you), by the strangest bearers you can imagine, every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the Barriers. At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily as in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped.”  “And do you really go to-night?”  “I really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay.”  “And do you take no one with you?”  “All sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing to say to any of them. I intend to take Jerry. Jerry has been my body-guard on Sunday nights for a long time past, and I am used to him. Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master.”  “I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness.”  “I must say again, nonsense, nonsense! When I have executed this little commission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellson’s proposal to retire and live at my ease. Time enough, then, to think about growing old.”  This dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry’s usual desk, with Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he would do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long. It was too much the way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and it was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this terrible Revolution as if it were the one only harvest ever known under the skies that had not been sown—as if nothing had ever been done, or omitted to be done, that had led to it—as if observers of the wretched millions in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that should have made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming, years before, and had not in plain words recorded what they saw. Such vapouring, combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself, and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth. And it was such vapouring all about  his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so.  Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King’s Bench Bar, far on his way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him, Darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his word, when the thing that was to be went on to shape itself out.  The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay that he saw the direction—the more quickly because it was his own right name. The address, turned into English, ran: “Very pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evrémonde, of France, Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers, London, England.”  On the marriage morning, Dr. Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should be—unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation—kept inviolate between them. Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife had no suspicion of the fact; Mr. Lorry could have none.  “No,” said Mr. Lorry, in reply to the House; “I have referred it, I think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found.”  The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank, there was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr. Lorry’s desk. He held the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the person of this plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That, and The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in English, concerning the Marquis who was not to be found.  “Nephew, I believe—but in any case degenerate successor—of the polished Marquis who was murdered,” said one. “Happy to say, I never knew him.”  “A craven who abandoned his post,” said another—this Monseigneur had been got out of Paris, legs uppermost and half suffocated, in a load of hay—“some years ago.”  “Infected with the new doctrines,” said a third, eyeing the direction through his glass in passing; “set himself in opposition to the last Marquis, abandoned the estates when he inherited them, and left them to the ruffian herd. They will recompense him now, I hope, as he deserves.”  “Hey?” cried the blatant Stryver. “Did he though? Is that the sort of fellow? Let us look at his infamous name. D—n the fellow!”  Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver on the shoulder, and said:  “I know the fellow.”  “Do you, by Jupiter?” said Stryver. “I am sorry for it.”  “Why?”  “Why, Mr. Darnay? D’ye hear what he did? Don’t ask, why, in these times.”  “But I do ask why.”  “Then I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it. I am sorry to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions. Here is a fellow, who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him? Well, but I’ll answer you. I am sorry because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel. That’s why.”  Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked him self, and said: “You may not understand the gentleman.”  “I understand how to put you in a corner, Mr. Darnay,” said Bully Stryver, “and I’ll do it. If this fellow is a gentleman, I don’t understand him. You may tell him so, with my compliments. You may also tell him, from me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at the head of them. But, no, gentlemen,” said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his fingers, “I know something of human nature, and I tell you that you’ll never find a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such precious protégés . No, gentlemen; he’ll always show ’em a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle, and sneak away.”  With those words, and a final snap of his fingers, Mr. Stryver shouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of his hearers. Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk, in the general departure from the Bank.  “Will you take charge of the letter?” said Mr. Lorry. “You know where to deliver it?”  “I do.”  “Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and that it has been here some time?”  “I will do so. Do you start for Paris from here?”  “From here, at eight.”  “I will come back, to see you off.”  Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men, Darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple, opened the letter, and read it. These were its contents:  “PRISON OF THE ABBAYE, PARIS. JUNE 21, 1792.  \n“MONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS,  “After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and brought a long journey on foot to Paris. On the road I have suffered a great deal. Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed—razed to the ground.  “The crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and shall lose my life (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, treason against the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them for an emigrant. It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them, and not against, according to your commands. It is in vain I represent that, before the sequestration of emigrant property, I have remitted the imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had had recourse to no process. The only response is, that I have acted for an emigrant, and where is that emigrant?  “Ah! most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, where is that emigrant? I cry in my sleep where is he? I demand of Heaven, will he not come to deliver me? No answer. Ah Monsieur heretofore the  Marquis. I send my desolate cry across the sea, hoping it may perhaps reach your ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris!  “For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, to succour and release me. My fault is, that I have been true to you. Oh Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I pray you be you true to me!  “From this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.  \n“Your afflicted\n“GABELLE.”  The latent uneasiness in Darnay’s mind was roused to vigorous life by this letter. The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose only crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so reproachfully in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the Temple considering what to do, he almost hid his face from the passers-by.  He knew very well, that in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his resentful suspicions of his uncle, and in the aversion with which his conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold, he had acted imperfectly. He knew very well, that in his love for Lucie, his renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own mind, had been hurried and incomplete. He knew that he ought to have systematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he had meant to do it, and that it had never been done.  The happiness of his own chosen English home, the necessity of being always actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of the time which had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week annihilated the immature plans of last week, and the events of the week following made all new again; he knew very well, that to the force of these circumstances he had yielded:—not without disquiet, but still without continuous and accumulating resistance. That he had watched the times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled until the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping  from France by every highway and byway, and their property was in course of confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out, was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in France that might impeach him for it.  But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no favour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own bread. Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little there was to give—such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the summer—and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his own safety, so that it could not but appear now.  This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make, that he would go to Paris.  Yes. Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him to itself, and he must go. Everything that arose before his mind drifted him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible attraction. His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he who could not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there, trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy and humanity. With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching him, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison (injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur, which had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were coarse and galling, for old reasons. Upon those, had followed Gabelle’s letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his justice, honour, and good name.  His resolution was made. He must go to Paris.  Yes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he struck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. The intention with which he had done what he had done, even although he had left it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that  would be gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting him self to assert it. Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging Revolution that was running so fearfully wild.  As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone. Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old, should come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in the balance of suspense and doubt. How much of the incompleteness of his situation was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind, he did not discuss with himself. But, that circumstance too, had had its influence in his course.  He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to return to Tellson’s and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say nothing of his intention now.  A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was booted and equipped.  “I have delivered that letter,” said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. “I would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but perhaps you will take a verbal one?”  “That I will, and readily,” said Mr. Lorry, “if it is not dangerous.”  “Not at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.”  “What is his name?” said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his hand.  “Gabelle.”  “Gabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?”  “Simply, ‘that he has received the letter, and will come.’ ”  “Any time mentioned?”  “He will start upon his journey to-morrow night.”  “Any person mentioned?”  “No.”  He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks, and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old  Bank into the misty air of Fleet-street. “My love to Lucie, and to little Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry at parting, “and take precious care of them till I come back.” Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage rolled away.  That night—it was the fourteenth of August—he sat up late, and wrote two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances. To both, he wrote that he would despatch letters in proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival.  It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first reservation of their joint lives on his mind. It was a hard matter to preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious. But, an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it, so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and the day passed quickly away. Early in the evening he embraced her, and her scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-by (an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets, with a heavier heart.  The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it. He left his two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before midnight, and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his journey. “For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your noble name!” was the poor prisoner’s cry with which he strengthened his sinking heart, as he left all that was dear on earth behind him, and floated away for the Loadstone Rock.  \nTHE END OF THE SECOND BOOK \n\n BOOK THE THIRD \n![016](bano_9781411433236_oeb_016_r1.jpg)\n The Track of a Storm \n\n CHAPTER 1  In Secret  T he traveller fared slowly on his way, who fared towards Paris from England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two. More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad horses, he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory; but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these. Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of citizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them, inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own, turned them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning Republic One and Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death.  A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when Charles Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at Paris. Whatever might befall now, he must on to his journey’s end. Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him, but he knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him and England. The universal watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken in a net, or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone.  This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge. He had been days upon his journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired out, in a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris.  Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle’s letter from  his prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far. His difficulty at the guard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey to have come to a crisis. And he was, therefore, as little surprised as a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.  Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the bed.  “Emigrant,” said the functionary, “I am going to send you on to Paris, under an escort.”  “Citizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could dispense with the escort.”  “Silence!” growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-end of his musket. “Peace, aristocrat!”  “It is as the good patriot says,” observed the timid functionary. “You are an aristocrat, and must have an escort—and must pay for it.”  “I have no choice,” said Charles Darnay.  “Choice! Listen to him!” cried the same scowling red-cap. “As if it was not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!”  “It is always as the good patriot says,” observed the functionary. “Rise and dress yourself, emigrant.”  Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by a watch-fire. Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he started with it on the wet, wet roads at three o’clock in the morning.  The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either side of him. The escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached to his bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his wrist. In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement, and out upon the mire-deep roads. In this state they traversed without change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay between them and the capital.  They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and lying by until the twilight fell. The escort were so wretchedly  clothed, that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off. Apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for, he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations, confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.  But when they came to the town of Beauvais—which they did at eventide, when the streets were filled with people—he could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming. An ominous crowd gathered to see him dismount at the posting-yard, and many voices called out loudly, “Down with the emigrant!”  He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and, resuming it as his safest place, said:  “Emigrant, my friends! Do you not see me here, in France, of my own will?”  “You are a cursed emigrant,” cried a farrier, making at him in a furious manner through the press, hammer in hand; “and you are a cursed aristocrat!”  The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider’s bridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, “Let him be; let him be! He will be judged at Paris.”  “Judged!” repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer. “Ay! and condemned as a traitor.” At this the crowd roared approval.  Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his horse’s head to the yard (the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on, with the line round his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could make his voice heard:  “Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. I am not a traitor.”  “He lies!” cried the smith. “He is a traitor since the decree. His life is forfeit to the people. His cursed life is not his own!”  At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which another instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his  horse’s flanks, and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates. The farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no more was done.  “What is this decree that the smith spoke of?” Darnay asked the postmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the yard.  “Truly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants.”  “When passed?”  “On the fourteenth.”  “The day I left England!”  “Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be others—if there are not already—banishing all emigrants, and condemning all to death who return. That is what he meant when he said your life was not your own.”  “But there are no such decrees yet?”  “What do I know!” said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders; “there may be, or there will be. It is all the same. What would you have?”  They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep. Among the many wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep. After long and lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night, circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn up together singing a Liberty song. Happily, however, there was sleep in Beauvais that night to help them out of it, and they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by the sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.  Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. The barrier was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.  “Where are the papers of this prisoner?” demanded a resolute-looking man in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.  Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen, in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.  “Where,” repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him whatever, “are the papers of this prisoner?”  The drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them. Casting his eyes over Gabelle’s letter, the same personage in authority showed some disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close attention.  He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the gate. Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress into the city for peasants’ carts bringing in supplies, and for similar traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest people, was very difficult. A numerous medley of men and women, not to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue forth; but, the previous identification was so strict, that they filtered through the barrier very slowly. Some of these people knew their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered about. The red cap and tricolour cockade were universal, both among men and women.  When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these things, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority, who directed the guard to open the barrier. Then he delivered to the escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him to dismount. He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse, turned and rode away without entering the city.  He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake, drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about. The light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps of the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly uncertain condition. Some registers were lying    open on a desk, and an officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.  \n Before the Prison Tribunal \n![017](bano_9781411433236_oeb_017_r1.jpg)\n “Citizen Defarge,” said he to Darnay’s conductor, as he took a slip of paper to write on. “Is this the emigrant Evrémonde?”  “This is the man.”  “Your age, Evrémonde?”  “Thirty-seven.”  “Married, Evrémonde?”  “Yes.”  “Where married?”  “In England.”  “Without doubt. Where is your wife, Evrémonde?”  “In England.”  “Without doubt. You are consigned, Evrémonde, to the prison of La Force.”  “Just Heaven!” exclaimed Darnay. “Under what law, and for what offence?”  The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.  “We have new laws, Evrémonde, and new offences, since you were here.” He said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.  “I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you. I demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. Is not that my right?”  “Emigrants have no rights, Evrémonde,” was the stolid reply. The officer wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had written, sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words “In secret.”  Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him. The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended them.  “Is it you,” said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the guard-house steps and turned into Paris, “who married the daughter of Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?”  “Yes,” replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.  “My name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint Antoine. Possibly you have heard of me.”  “My wife came to your house to reclaim her father? Yes!”  The word “wife” seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge, to say with sudden impatience, “In the name of that sharp female newly-born, and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?”  “You heard me say why, a minute ago. Do you not believe it is the truth?”  “A bad truth for you,” said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and looking straight before him.  “Indeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me a little help?”  “None.” Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him.  “Will you answer me a single question?”  “Perhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is.”  “In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free communication with the world outside?”  “You will see.”  “I am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of presenting my case?”  “You will see. But, what then? Other people have been similarly buried in worse prisons, before now.”  “But never by me, Citizen Defarge.”  Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady and set silence. The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope there was—or so Darnay thought—of his softening in any slight degree. He, therefore, made haste to say:  “It is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate to Mr. Lorry of Tellson’s Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris, the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into the prison of La Force. Will you cause that to be done for me?”  “I will do,” Defarge doggedly rejoined, “nothing for you. My duty is to my country and the People. I am the sworn servant of both, against you. I will do nothing for you.”  Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride was touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing  along the streets. The very children scarcely noticed him. A few passers turned their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat; otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal family. The few words that he caught from this man’s lips, first made it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road (except at Beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him.  That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed themselves when he left England, he of course knew now. That perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster yet, he of course knew now. He could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen the events of a few days. And yet his misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by the light of this later time, they would appear. Troubled as the future was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope. The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which within a few rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away. The “sharp female newly-born, and called La Guillotine,” was hardly known to him, or to the generality of people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers. How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?  Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. With this on his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison court-yard, he arrived at the prison of La Force.  A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge presented “The Emigrant Evrémonde.”  “What the Devil! How many more of them!” exclaimed the man with the bloated face.  Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew, with his two fellow-patriots.  “What the Devil, I say again!” exclaimed the gaoler, left with his wife. “How many more!”  The gaoler’s wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely replied, “One must have patience, my dear!” Three turnkeys who entered responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment and one added, “For the love of Liberty;” which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion.  The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for!  “In secret, too,” grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper. “As if I was not already full to bursting!”  He stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates.  “Come!” said the chief, at length taking up his keys, “come with me, emigrant.”  Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them, until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with prisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the room.  In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace, the new comer recoiled from this company. But the crowning unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to receive him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life.  So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate  squalor and misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand in a company of the dead. Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty, the ghost of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost of frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.  It struck him motionless. The gaoler standing at his side, and the other gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to appearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were there—with the apparitions of the coquette, the young beauty, and the mature woman delicately bred—that the inversion of all experience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its utmost. Surely, ghosts all. Surely, the long unreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!  “In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune,” said a gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, “I have the honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you on the calamity that has brought you among us. May it soon terminate happily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here, to ask your name and condition?”  Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in words as suitable as he could find.  “But I hope,” said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his eyes, who moved across the room, “that you are not in secret?”  “I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say so.”  “Ah, what a pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted but a short time.” Then he added, raising his voice, “I grieve to inform the society—in secret.”  There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many voices—among which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous—gave him good wishes and encouragement. He turned at the grated door, to render the thanks of his heart; it closed  under the gaoler’s hand; and the apparitions vanished from his sight for ever.  The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. When they had ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a solitary cell. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.  “Yours,” said the gaoler.  “Why am I confined alone?”  “How do I know!”  “I can buy pen, ink, and paper?”  “Such are not my orders. You will be visited, and can ask then. At present, you may buy your food, and nothing more.”  There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. As the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like a man who had been drowned and filled with water. When the gaoler was gone, he thought in the same wandering way, “Now am I left, as if I were dead.” Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it with a sick feeling, and thought, “And here in these crawling creatures is the first condition of the body after death.”  “Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half.” The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell, counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a wild swell of voices added to them. “He made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes.” The prisoner counted the measurement again, and paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition. “The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. There was one among them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon her golden hair, and she looked like **** Let us ride on again, for God’s sake, through the illuminated villages with the people all awake! **** He made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. **** Five paces by four and a half.” With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting and counting; and the roar of  the city changed to this extent—that it still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he knew, in the swell that rose above them. \n\n CHAPTER 2  The Grindstone  T ellson’s Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was in a wing of a large house, approached by a court yard and shut off from the street by a high wall and a strong gate. The house belonged to a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the troubles, in his own cook’s dress, and got across the borders. A mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in question.  Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready and willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur’s house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated. For, all things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of Monseigneur’s house, and had marked it with the tricolour, and were drinking brandy in its state apartments.  A place of business in London like Tellson’s place of business in Paris, would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette. For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank court-yard, and even to a Cupid over the counter? Yet such things were. Tellson’s had whitewashed the Cupid, but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest linen, aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to night. Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of  this young Pagan, in Lombard-street, London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the wall, and also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest provocation. Yet, a French Tellson’s could get on with these things exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had taken fright at them, and drawn out his money.  What money would be drawn out of Tellson’s henceforth, and what would lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in Tellson’s hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons, and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with Tellson’s never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions. He sat by a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the room distortedly reflect—a shade of horror.  He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which he had grown to be a part, like a strong root-ivy. It chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about that. All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did his duty. On the opposite side of the court-yard, under a colonnade, was extensive standing for carriages—where, indeed, some carriages of Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy, or other workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire. He had opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and he had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.  From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible nature were going up to Heaven.  “Thank God,” said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, “that no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night. May He have mercy on all who are in danger!”  Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought, “They have come back!” and sat listening. But, there was no loud irruption into the court-yard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate clash again, and all was quiet.  The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally awaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in amazement.  Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life.  “What is this?” cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. “What is the matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here? What is it?”  With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted out in his arms, imploringly, “O my dear friend! My husband!”  “Your husband, Lucie?”  “Charles.”  “What of Charles?”  “Here.”  “Here, in Paris?”  “Has been here some days—three or four—I don’t know how many—I can’t collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison.”  The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the court-yard.  “What is that noise?” said the Doctor, turning towards the window.  “Don’t look!” cried Mr. Lorry. “Don’t look out! Manette, for your life, don’t touch the blind!”  The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and said, with a cool bold smile:  “My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been a Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris—in Paris? In France—who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph. My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I told Lucie so.—What is that noise?” His hand was again upon the window.  “Don’t look!” cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. “No, Lucie, my dear, nor you!” He got his arm round her, and held her. “Don’t be so terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place. What prison is he in?”  “La Force!”  “La Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in your life—and you were always both—you will compose yourself now, to do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or I can say. There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night; you cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because what I must bid you to do for Charles’s sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. You must instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in a room at the back here. You must leave your father and me alone for two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not delay.”  “I will be submissive to you. I see in your face that you know I can do nothing else than this. I know you are true.”  The old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned the key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and partly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctor’s arm, and looked out with him into the court-yard.  Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in  number, or near enough, to fill the court-yard: not more than forty or fifty in all. The people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they had rushed in to work at the grind-stone; it had evidently been set up there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot.  But, such awful workers, and such awful work!  The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise. False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of sleep. As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women held wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire.The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to get next at the sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women’s lace and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through and through. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be sharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in their frenzied eyes;—eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.  All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it were there. They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for explanation in his friend’s ashy face.  “They are,” Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully  round at the locked room, “murdering the prisoners. If you are sure of what you say; if you really have the power you think you have—as I believe you have—make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to La Force. It may be too late, I don’t know, but let it not be a minute later!”  Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room, and was in the court-yard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind.  His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water, carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone. For a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him, surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with cries of—“Live the Bastille prisoner! Help for the Bastille prisoner’s kindred in La Force! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! Save the prisoner Evrémonde at La Force!” and a thousand answering shouts.  He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband. He found her child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat watching them in such quiet as the night knew.  Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet, clinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge. O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife! And O the long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings!  Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered. “What is it?” cried Lucie, affrighted. “Hush! The soldiers’ swords are sharpened there,” said Mr. Lorry. “The place is national property now, and used as a kind of armoury, my love.”  Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful. Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached him self from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. A man, so besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier  creeping back to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement by the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air. Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle, climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its dainty cushions.  The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again, and the sun was red on the court-yard. But, the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had never given, and would never take away. \n\n CHAPTER 3  The Shadow  O ne of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr. Lorry when business hours came round, was this:—that he had no right to imperil Tellson’s by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the Bank roof. His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded for Lucie and her child, without a moment’s demur; but the great trust he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict man of business.  At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in its dangerous workings.  Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute’s delay tending to compromise Tellson’s, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She said that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that Quarter, near the Banking-house. As there was no business objection to this, and as he foresaw that even if it were well with Charles, and he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.  To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross: giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself. He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear considerable knocking on the head, and returned to his own occupations. A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him.  It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed. He was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair. In a few moments, a man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him, addressed him by his name.  “Your servant,” said Mr. Lorry. “Do you know me?”  He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five to fifty years of age. For answer he repeated, without any change of emphasis, the words:  “Do you know me?”  “I have seen you somewhere.”  “Perhaps at my wine-shop?”  Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: “You come from Doctor Manette?”  “Yes. I come from Doctor Manette.”  “And what says he? What does he send me?”  Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It bore the words in the Doctor’s writing:  “Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet. I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note from Charles to his wife. Let the bearer see his wife.”  It was dated from La Force, within an hour.  “Will you accompany me,” said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading this note aloud, “to where his wife resides?”  “Yes,” returned Defarge.  Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went  down into the court-yard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.  “Madame Defarge, surely!” said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in exactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago.  “It is she,” observed her husband.  “Does madame go with us?” inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she moved as they moved.  “Yes. That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons. It is for their safety.”  Beginning to be struck by Defarge’s manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously at him, and led the way. Both the women followed; the second woman being The Vengeance.  They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might, ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry, and found Lucie weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport by the tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that delivered his note—little thinking what it had been doing near him in the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.  “DEAREST,—Take courage. I am well, and your father has influence around me. You cannot answer this. Kiss our child for me.”  That was all the writing. It was so much, however, to her who received it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly action, but the hand made no response—dropped cold and heavy, and took to its knitting again.  There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.  “My dear,” said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; “there are frequent risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom he has the power to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them—that she may identify them. I believe,” said Mr. Lorry, rather halting  in his reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more, “I state the case, Citizen Defarge?”  Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence.  “You had better, Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to propitiate, by tone and manner, “have the dear child here, and our good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no French.”  The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and danger, appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance, whom her eyes first encountered, “Well, I am sure, Boldface! I hope you are pretty well!” She also bestowed a British cough on Madame Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.  “Is that his child?” said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it were the finger of Fate.  “Yes, madame,” answered Mr. Lorry; “this is our poor prisoner’s darling daughter, and only child.”  The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.  “It is enough, my husband,” said Madame Defarge. “I have seen them. We may go.”  But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it—not visible and presented, but indistinct and withheld—to alarm Lucie into saying, as she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge’s dress:  “You will be good to my poor husband.You will do him no harm. You will help me to see him if you can?”  “Your husband is not my business here,” returned Madame Defarge, looking down at her with perfect composure. “It is the daughter of your father who is my business here.”  “For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child’s  sake! She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more afraid of you than of these others.”  Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband. Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her, collected his face into a sterner expression.  “What is it that your husband says in that little letter?” asked Madame Defarge, with a lowering smile. “Influence; he says something touching influence?”  “That my father,” said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, “has much influence around him.”  “Surely it will release him!” said Madame Defarge. “Let it do so.”  “As a wife and mother,” cried Lucie, most earnestly, “I implore you to have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman, think of me. As a wife and mother!”  Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said, turning to her friend The Vengeance:  “The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered? We have known their husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them, often enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst, sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?”  “We have seen nothing else,” returned The Vengeance.  “We have borne this a long time,” said Madame Defarge, turning her eyes again upon Lucie. “Judge you! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now?”  She resumed her knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed. Defarge went last, and closed the door.  “Courage, my dear Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her. “Courage, courage! So far all goes well with us—much, much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a thankful heart.”  “I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a shadow on me and on all my hopes.”  “Tut, tut!” said Mr. Lorry; “what is this despondency in the brave little breast? A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie.”  But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself, for all that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly. \n\n CHAPTER 4  Calm in Storm  D octor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her had been tainted by the slain. She only knew that there had been an attack upon the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.  To Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him through a scene of carnage to the prison of La Force. That, in the prison he had found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back to their cells. That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal, he had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him, and that this man was Defarge.  That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table, that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard to the Tribunal—of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some dirty with murder and some clean, some sober  and some not—for his life and liberty. That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as a notable sufferer under the over-thrown system, it had been accorded to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and examined. That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. That, the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance, delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.  The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and dress the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man with the gentlest solicitude—had made a litter for him and escorted him carefully from the spot—had then caught up their weapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.  As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face of his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that such dread experiences would revive the old danger. But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never at all known him in his present character. For the first time the Doctor felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the first time he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron  which could break the prison door of his daughter’s husband, and deliver him. “It all tended to a good end, my friend: it was not mere waste and ruin. As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid of Heaven I will do it!” Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.  Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept him self in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor’s hand), but she was not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.  This new life of the Doctor’s was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it. Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one; but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness. Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles’s ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change, that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to trust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. “All curious to see,” thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably  shrewd way, “but all natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it couldn’t be in better hands.”  But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial, the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils of France, as if the dragon’s teeth had been sown broadcast, and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore. What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year One of Liberty —the deluge rising from below, not falling from above, and with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened!  There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as when time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the head of the king—and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.  And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected, which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing; these things became the established order and nature of appointed things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old. Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before the general gaze from the foundations of the world—the figure of the sharp female called La Guillotine.  It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache, it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack. It was the sign of the regeneration of the human race. It superseded the Cross. Models of it were worn on breasts from which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and believed in where the Cross was denied.  It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted, were a rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. It hushed the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes. The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger than his namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God’s own Temple every day.  Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked with a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously persistent in his end, never doubting that he would save Lucie’s husband at last. Yet the current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident. So much more wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month, that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares under the southern wintry sun. Still, the Doctor walked among the terrors with a steady head. No man better known than he, in Paris at that day; no man in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and victims, he was a man apart. In the exercise of his skill, the appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all other men. He was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were a Spirit moving among mortals. \n\n CHAPTER 5  The Wood-sawyer  O ne year and three months. During all that time Lucie was never sure, from hour to hour, but that the Guillotine would strike off her husband’s head next day. Every day, through the stony streets, the tumbrils now jolted heavily, filled with Condemned. Lovely girls; bright women, brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and old; gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La Guillotine, all daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons, and carried to her through the street to slake her devouring thirst. Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death;—the last, much the easiest to bestow, O Guillotine!  If the suddenness of her calamity, and the whirling wheels of the time, had stunned the Doctor’s daughter into awaiting the result in idle despair, it would but have been with her as it was with many. But, from the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in the garret of Saint Antoine, she had been true to her duties. She was truest to them in the season of trial, as all the quietly loyal and good will always be.  As soon as they were established in their new residence, and her father had entered on the routine of his avocations, she arranged the little household as exactly as if her husband had been there. Everything had its appointed place and its appointed time. Little Lucie she taught, as regularly, as if they had all been united in their English home. The slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief that they would soon be reunited—the little preparations for his speedy return, the setting aside of his chair and his books—these, and the solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner  especially, among the many unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death—were almost the only outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind.  She did not greatly alter in appearance. The plain dark dresses, akin to mourning dresses, which she and her child wore, were as neat and as well attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days. She lost her colour, and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional, thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely. Sometimes, at night on kissing her father, she would burst into the grief she had repressed all day, and would say that her sole reliance, under Heaven, was on him. He always resolutely answered: “Nothing can happen to him without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him, Lucie.”  They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks, when her father said to her, on coming home one evening:  “My dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles can sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon. When he can get to it—which depends on many uncertainties and incidents—he might see you in the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can show you. But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.”  “O show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day.”  From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. As the clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away. When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they went together; at other times she was alone; but she never missed a single day.  It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. The hovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that end; all else was wall. On the third day of her being there, he noticed her.  “Good day, citizeness.”  “Good day, citizen.”  This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots; but, was now law for everybody.  “Walking here again, citizeness?”  “You see me, citizen!”  The wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture (he had once been a mender of roads), cast a glance at the prison, pointed at the prison, and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent bars, peeped through them jocosely.  “But it’s not my business,” said he. And went on sawing his wood.  Next day he was looking out for her, and accosted her the moment she appeared.  “What? Walking here again, citizeness?”  “Yes, citizen.”  “Ah! A child too! Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?”  “Do I say yes, mamma?” whispered little Lucie, drawing close to her.  “Yes, dearest.”  “Yes, citizen.”  “Ah! But it’s not my business. My work is my business. See my saw! I call it my Little Guillotine. La, la, la; La, la, la! And off his head comes!”  The billet fell as he spoke, and he threw it into a basket.  “I call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine. See here again! Loo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo! And off her head comes! Now, a child. Tickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle! And off its head comes. All the family!”  Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it was impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not be in his sight. Thenceforth, to secure his good will, she al ways spoke to him first, and often gave him drink-money, which he readily received.  He was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite forgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her heart up to her husband, she would come to herself to find him looking at her, with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work. “But it’s not my business!” he would generally say at those times, and would briskly fall to his sawing again.  In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall. Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it  might be once in five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not for a week or a fortnight together. It was enough that he could and did see her when the chances served, and on that possibility she would have waited out the day, seven days a week.  These occupations brought her round to the December month, wherein her father walked among the terrors with a steady head. On a lightly-snowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner. It was a day of some wild rejoicing, and a festival. She had seen the houses, as she came along, decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them; also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription (tricoloured letters were the favourite), Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!  The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. He had got somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in with most inappropriate difficulty. On his house top, he displayed pike and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed his saw inscribed as his “Little Sainte Guillotine”—for the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised. His shop was shut and he was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone.  But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear. A moment afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with The Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other music than their own singing. They danced to the popular Revolution song, keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison. Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced together, as hazard had brought them together. At first, they were a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them. They advanced, retreated, struck at one another’s hands, clutched at one another’s heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round in pairs, until many  of them dropped. While those were down, the rest linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke, and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then reversed the spin, and all spun round another way. Suddenly they stopped again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half so terrible as this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport—a something, once innocent, delivered over to all devilry—a healthy pastime changed into a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the heart. Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how warped and perverted all things good by nature were become. The maidenly bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child’s head thus distracted, the delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of the disjointed time.  This was the Carmagnole. As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and bewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer’s house, the feathery snow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been.  “O my father!” for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she had momentarily darkened with her hand; “such a cruel, bad sight.”  “I know, my dear, I know. I have seen it many times. Don’t be frightened! Not one of them would harm you.”  “I am not frightened for myself, my father. But when I think of my husband, and the mercies of these people—”  “We will set him above their mercies very soon. I left him climbing to the window, and I came to tell you. There is no one here to see. You may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof.”  “I do so, father, and I send him my Soul with it!”  “You cannot see him, my poor dear?”  “No, father,” said Lucie, yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand, “no.”  A footstep in the snow. Madame Defarge. “I salute you, citizeness,” from the Doctor. “I salute you, citizen.” This in passing. Nothing more. Madame Defarge gone, like a shadow over the white road.  “Give me your arm, my love. Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness and courage, for his sake. That was well done;” they had left the spot; “it shall not be in vain. Charles is summoned for to morrow.”  “For to-morrow!”  “There is no time to lose. I am well prepared, but there are precautions to be taken, that could not be taken until he was actually summoned before the Tribunal. He has not received the notice yet, but I know that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow, and removed to the Conciergerie; I have timely information. You are not afraid?”  She could scarcely answer, “I trust in you.”  “Do so, implicitly. Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he shall be restored to you within a few hours; I have encompassed him with every protection. I must see Lorry.”  He stopped. There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing. They both knew too well what it meant. One. Two. Three. Three tumbrils faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow.  “I must see Lorry,” the Doctor repeated, turning her another way.  The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust; had never left it. He and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated and made national. What he could save for the owners, he saved. No better man living to hold fast by what Tellson’s had in keeping, and to hold his peace.  A murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the Seine, denoted the approach of darkness. It was almost dark when they arrived at the Bank. The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and deserted. Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the letters: National Property. Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death.  Who could that be with Mr. Lorry—the owner of the riding-coat upon the chair—who must not be seen? From whom newly arrived, did he come out, agitated and surprised, to take his favourite in his arms? To whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words, when, raising his voice and turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued, he said: “Removed to the Conciergerie, and summoned for to-morrow?” \n\n CHAPTER 6  Triumph  T he dread Tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. The standard gaoler-joke was, “Come out and listen to the Evening Paper, you inside there!”  “Charles Evrémonde, called Darnay!”  So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force.  When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded. Charles Evrémonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he had seen hundreds pass away so.  His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twenty-three names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been guillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in the vaulted chamber where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his arrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the scaffold.  There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was soon over. It was the incident of every day, and the society of La Force were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little concert, for that evening. They crowded to the grates and shed tears there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs who kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far from insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to  die by it, was not mere boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. In seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the disease—a terrible passing inclination to die of it. And all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke them.  The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in its vermin-haunted cells was long and cold. Next day, fifteen prisoners were put to the bar before Charles Darnay’s name was called. All the fifteen were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half.  “Charles Evrémonde, called Darnay,” was at length arraigned.  His Judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing. Looking at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving, anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. Of the men, the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many knitted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked. She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly remembered as Defarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to himself as they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at the Jury, but at nothing else. Under the President sat Doctor Manette, in his usual quiet dress. As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr. Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the Carmagnole.  Charles Evrémonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the decree which banished all emigrants on pain of Death. It was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to France. There he  was, and there was the decree; he had been taken in France, and his head was demanded.  “Take off his head!” cried the audience. “An enemy to the Republic!”  The President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in England?  Undoubtedly it was.  Was he not an emigrant then? What did he call himself?  Not an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law.  Why not? the President desired to know.  Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left his country—he submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the Tribunal was in use—to live by his own industry in England, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France.  What proof had he of this?  He handed in the names of two witnesses: Théophile Gabelle, and Alexandre Manette.  But he had married in England? the President reminded him.  True, but not an English woman.  A citizeness of France?  Yes. By birth.  Her name and family?  “Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who sits there.”  This answer had a happy effect upon the audience. Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the hall. So capriciously were the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him.  On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his foot according to Doctor Manette’s reiterated instructions. The same cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every inch of his road.  The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not sooner?  He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means of living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in England, he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature. He had returned when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his absence. He had come back, to save a citizen’s life, and to bear his testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth. Was that criminal in the eyes of the Republic?  The populace cried enthusiastically, “No!” and the President rang his bell to quiet them. Which it did not, for they continued to cry “No!” until they left off, of their own will.  The President required the name of that Citizen? The accused explained that the citizen was his first witness. He also referred with confidence to the citizen’s letter, which had been taken from him at the Barrier, but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before the President.  The Doctor had taken care that it should be there—had assured him that it would be there—and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read. Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. Citizen Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly overlooked in his prison of the Abbaye—in fact, had rather passed out of the Tribunal’s patriotic remembrance—until three days ago; when he had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury’s declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evrémonde, called Darnay.  Doctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity, and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as the foe of England and friend of the United States—as he brought  these circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the populace became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself, had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that they were ready with their votes if the President were content to receive them.  At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace set up a shout of applause. All the voices were in the prisoner’s favour, and the President declared him free.  Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against their swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable, to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets.  His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried, rescued him from these caresses for the moment. Five were to be tried together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not assisted it by word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to compensate itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four hours. The first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign of Death—a raised finger —and they all added in words, “Long live the Republic!”  The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings, for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a great crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in Court—except two, for which he looked in vain.  On his coming out, the concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the shore.  They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which they had taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages. Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. In this car of triumph, not even the Doctor’s entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home on men’s shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him, and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine.  In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing him out, they carried him on. Reddening the snowy streets with the prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried him thus into the court-yard of the building where she lived. Her father had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his feet, she dropped insensible in his arms.  As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all the rest fell to dancing, and the court-yard overflowed with the Carmagnole. Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river’s bank, and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled them away.  After grasping the Doctor’s hand, as he stood victorious and proud before him; after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole; after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who lifted her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their rooms.  “Lucie! My own! I am safe.”  “O dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have prayed to Him.”  They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. When she was again in his arms, he said to her:  “And now speak to your father, dearest. No other man in all this France could have done what he has done for me.”  She laid her head upon her father’s breast, as she had laid his poor head on her own breast, long, long ago. He was happy in the return he had made her, he was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud of his strength. “You must not be weak, my darling,” he remonstrated; “don’t tremble so. I have saved him.” \n\n CHAPTER 7  A Knock at the Door  “ I have saved him.” It was not another of the dreams in which he had often come back; he was really here. And yet his wife trembled, and a vague but heavy fear was upon her.  All the air around was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be. The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. Her mind pursued them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more.  Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this woman’s weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no shoemaking, no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had  accomplished the task he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved Charles. Let them all lean upon him.  Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment, had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards the living of the poorer prisoners. Partly on this account, and partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and citizeness who acted as porters at the court-yard gate, rendered them occasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by Mr. Lorry) had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every night.  It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or door-post of every house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground. Mr. Jerry Cruncher’s name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name himself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette had employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evrémonde, called Darnay.  In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual harmless ways of life were changed. In the Doctor’s little household, as in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small shops. To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.  For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the basket. Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home such purchases as were needful. Although Miss Pross, through her long association with a French family, might have known as much of their language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that direction; consequently she knew no more of that “nonsense” (as she was pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. So her manner of marketing was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She always made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price, one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be.  “Now, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity; “if you are ready, I am.”  Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross’s service. He had worn all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head down.  “There’s all manner of things wanted,” said Miss Pross, “and we shall have a precious time of it. We want wine, among the rest. Nice toasts these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it.”  “It will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,” retorted Jerry, “whether they drink your health or the Old Un’s.”  “Who’s he?” said Miss Pross.  Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning “Old Nick’s.”  “Ha!” said Miss Pross, “it doesn’t need an interpreter to explain the meaning of these creatures. They have but one, and it’s Midnight Murder, and Mischief.”  “Hush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!” cried Lucie.  “Yes, yes, yes, I’ll be cautious,” said Miss Pross; “but I may say among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobac coey smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the streets. Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back! Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don’t move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again! May I ask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?”  “I think you may take that liberty,” the Doctor answered, smiling.  “For gracious sake, don’t talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of that,” said Miss Pross.  “Hush, dear! Again?” Lucie remonstrated.  “Well, my sweet,” said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, “the short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious Majesty King George the Third;” Miss Pross curtseyed at the    name; “and as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!”  \n The Knock at the Door \n![018](bano_9781411433236_oeb_018_r1.jpg)\n Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words after Miss Pross, like somebody at church.  “I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though I wish you had never taken that cold in your voice,” said Miss Pross, approvingly. “But the question, Doctor Manette. Is there”—it was the good creature’s way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner—“is there any prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?”  “I fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet.”  “Heigh-ho-hum!” said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she glanced at her darling’s golden hair in the light of the fire, “then we must have patience and wait: that’s all. We must hold up our heads and fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!—Don’t you move, Ladybird!”  They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the child, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the Banking House. Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed. Little Lucie sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he, in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out a captive who had once done the Fairy a service. All was subdued and quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been.  “What is that?” she cried, all at once.  “My dear!” said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his hand on hers, “command yourself. What a disordered state you are in! The least thing—nothing—startles you! You , your father’s daughter!”  “I thought, my father,” said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face and in a faltering voice, “that I heard strange feet upon the stairs.”  “My love, the staircase is as still as Death.”  As he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.  “Oh father, father. What can this be! Hide Charles. Save him!”  “My child,” said the Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her  shoulder, “I have saved him. What weakness is this, my dear! Let me go to the door.”  He took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms, and opened it. A rude clattering of feet over the floor, and four rough men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room.  “The Citizen Evrémonde, called Darnay,” said the first.  “Who seeks him?” answered Darnay.  “I seek him. We seek him. I know you, Evrémonde; I saw you before the Tribunal to-day. You are again the prisoner of the Republic.”  The four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child clinging to him.  “Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?”  “It is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie, and will know to-morrow. You are summoned for to-morrow.”  Dr. Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that he stood with the lamp in his hand, as if he were a statue made to hold it, moved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and confronting the speaker, and taking him, not ungently, by the loose front of his red woollen shirt, said:  “You know him, you have said. Do you know me?”  “Yes, I know you, Citizen Doctor.”  “We all know you, Citizen Doctor,” said the other three.  He looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower voice, after a pause:  “Will you answer his question to me then? How does this happen?”  “Citizen Doctor,” said the first, reluctantly, “he has been denounced to the Section of Saint Antoine. This citizen,” pointing out the second who had entered, “is from Saint Antoine.”  The citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added:  “He is accused by Saint Antoine.”  “Of what?” asked the Doctor.  “Citizen Doctor,” said the first, with his former reluctance, “ask no more. If the Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them. The Republic goes before all. The People is supreme. Evrémonde, we are pressed.”  “One word,” the Doctor entreated. “Will you tell me who denounced him?”  “It is against rule,” answered the first; “but you can ask Him of Saint Antoine here.”  The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man. Who moved uneasily on his feet, rubbed his beard a little, and at length said:  “Well! Truly it is against rule. But he is denounced—and gravely—by the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge. And by one other.”  “What other?”  “Do you ask, Citizen Doctor?”  “Yes.”  “Then,” said he of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, “you will be answered to-morrow. Now, I am dumb!” \n\n CHAPTER 8  A Hand at Cards  H appily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases she had to make. Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side.They both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers. It was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the Army of the Republic. Woe to the man who played tricks with that Army, or got undeserved promotion in it! Better for him that his beard had never grown, for the National Razor shaved him close.  Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted. After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the  sign of The Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace, once (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather took her fancy. It had a quieter look than any other place of the same description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was not so red as the rest. Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him of her opinion, Miss Pross resorted to The Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, attended by her cavalier.  Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth, playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted, bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of the others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude, like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached the counter, and showed what they wanted.  As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a corner, and rose to depart. In going, he had to face Miss Pross. No sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped her hands.  In a moment, the whole company were on their feet. That somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all the outward aspects of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman, evidently English.  What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss Pross and her protector, though they had been all ears. But, they had no ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must be recorded, that not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but, Mr. Cruncher—though it seemed on his own separate and individual account—was in a state of the greatest wonder.  “What is the matter?” said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream; speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in English.  “Oh, Solomon, dear Solomon!” cried Miss Pross, clapping her  hands again. “After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time, do I find you here!”  “Don’t call me Solomon. Do you want to be the death of me?” asked the man, in a furtive, frightened way.  “Brother, brother!” cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. “Have I ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?”  “Then hold your meddlesome tongue,” said Solomon, “and come out, if you want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out. Who’s this man?”  Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means affectionate brother, said through her tears, “Mr. Cruncher.”  “Let him come out too,” said Solomon. “Does he think me a ghost?”  Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not a word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty, paid for her wine. As she did so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits.  “Now,” said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, “what do you want?”  “How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from!” cried Miss Pross, “to give me such a greeting, and show me no affection.”  “There. Con-found it! There,” said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross’s lips with his own. “Now are you content?”  Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence.  “If you expect me to be surprised,” said her brother Solomon, “I am not surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here. If you really don’t want to endanger my existence—which I half believe you do—go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine. I am busy. I am an official.”  “My English brother Solomon,” mourned Miss Pross, casting up her tear-fraught eyes, “that had the makings in him of one of the best and greatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and such foreigners! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in his—”  \n The Double Recognition \n![019](bano_9781411433236_oeb_019_r1.jpg)\n “I said so!” cried her brother, interrupting. “I knew it.You want to be the death of me. I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister. Just as I am getting on!”  “The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!” cried Miss Pross. “Far rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever loved you truly, and ever shall. Say but one affectionate word to me, and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will detain you no longer.”  Good Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of her. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact, years ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent her money and left her!  He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case, all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on the shoulder, hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular question:  “I say! Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John Solomon, or Solomon John?”  The official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not previously uttered a word.  “Come!” said Mr. Cruncher. “Speak out, you know.” (Which, by the way, was more than he could do himself.) “John Solomon, or Solomon John? She calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister. And I know you’re John, you know. Which of the two goes first? And regarding that name of Pross, likewise. That warn’t your name over the water.”  “What do you mean?”  “Well, I don’t know all I mean, for I can’t call to mind what your name was, over the water.”  “No?”  “No. But I’ll swear it was a name of two syllables.”  “Indeed?”  “Yes. T’other one’s was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy-witness at the Bailey. What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own father to yourself, was you called at that time?”  “Barsad,” said another voice, striking in.  “That’s the name for a thousand pound!” cried Jerry.  The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He had his hands behind him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr. Cruncher’s elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself.  “Don’t be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry’s, to his surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother. I wish you had a better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad was not a Sheep of the Prisons.”  Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The spy, who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared—  “I’ll tell you,” said Sydney. “I lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls, an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I remember faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.”  “What purpose?” the spy asked.  “It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the street. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your company—at the office of Tellson’s Bank, for instance?”  “Under a threat?”  “Oh! Did I say that?”  “Then, why should I go there?”  “Really, Mr. Barsad, I can’t say, if you can’t.”  “Do you mean that you won’t say, sir?” the spy irresolutely asked.  “You apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. I won’t.”  Carton’s negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind, and with such a man as he had to do with. His practised eye saw it, and made the most of it.  “Now, I told you so,” said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his sister; “if any trouble comes of this, it’s your doing.”  “Come, come, Mr. Barsad!” exclaimed Sydney. “Don’t be ungrateful. But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual satisfaction. Do you go with me to the Bank?”  “I’ll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I’ll go with you.”  “I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good city, at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry’s with us. Are we ready? Come then!”  Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney’s arm and looked up in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man. She was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her affection, and with Sydney’s friendly reassurances, adequately to heed what she observed.  They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr. Lorry’s, which was within a few minutes’ walk. John Barsad, or Solomon Pross, walked at his side.  Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fire—perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson’s, who had looked into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger.  “Miss Pross’s brother, sir,” said Sydney. “Mr. Barsad.”  “Barsad?” repeated the old gentleman, “Barsad? I have an association with the name—and with the face.”  “I told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,” observed Carton, coolly. “Pray sit down.”  As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted, by saying to him with a frown, “Witness at that trial.” Mr. Lorry immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence.  “Mr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate brother you have heard of,” said Sydney, “and has acknowledged the relationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again.”  Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, “What do you tell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about to return to him!”  “Arrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?”  “Just now, if at all.”  “Mr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir,” said Sydney, “and I have it from Mr. Barsad’s communication to a friend and brother Sheep over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He left the messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no earthly doubt that he is retaken.”  Mr. Lorry’s business eye read in the speaker’s face that it was loss of time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded him self, and was silently attentive.  “Now, I trust,” said Sydney to him, “that the name and influence of Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead tomorrow—you said he would be before the Tribunal again tomorrow, Mr. Barsad?—”  “Yes; I believe so.”  “—In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I own to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette’s not having had the power to prevent this arrest.”  “He may not have known of it beforehand,” said Mr. Lorry.  “But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how identified he is with his son-in-law.”  “That’s true,” Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.  “In short,” said Sydney, “this is a desperate time, when desperate games are played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning game; I will play the losing one. No man’s life here is worth purchase. Any one carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned to-morrow. Now, the stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr. Barsad.”  “You need have good cards, sir,” said the spy.  “I’ll run them over. I’ll see what I hold.—Mr. Lorry, you know what a brute I am; I wish you’d give me a little brandy.”  It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful—drank off another glassful—pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.  “Mr. Barsad,” he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand of cards: “Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer, so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name. That’s a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic English government, the enemy of France and freedom. That’s an excellent card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr. Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom, the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find. That’s a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my hand, Mr. Barsad?”  “Not to understand your play,” returned the spy, somewhat uneasily.  “I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Don’t hurry.”  He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and drank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking him self into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he poured out and drank another glassful.  “Look over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time.”  It was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing cards in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. Thrown out of his honourable employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing there—not because he was not wanted there: our English reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern date—he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. He knew that under the overthrown government  he had been a spy upon Saint Antoine and Defarge’s wine-shop; had received from the watchful police such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette’s imprisonment, release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always remembered with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved. He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every one employed as he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of his utmost tergiver sation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced, and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash his last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are men soon terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.  “You scarcely seem to like your hand,” said Sydney, with the greatest composure. “Do you play?”  “I think, sir,” said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to Mr. Lorry, “I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence, to put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace of which he has spoken. I admit that I am a spy, and that it is considered a discreditable station—though it must be filled by somebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one?”  “I play my Ace, Mr. Barsad,” said Carton, taking the answer on himself, and looking at his watch, “without any scruple in a very few minutes.”  “I should have hoped, gentlemen both,” said the spy, always striving to hook Mr. Lorry into the discussion, “that your respect for my sister—”  “I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother,” said Sydney Carton.  “You think not, sir?”  “I have thoroughly made up my mind about it.”  The smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanor, received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,—who was a mystery to wiser and honester men than he,—that it faltered here and failed him. While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his former air of contemplating cards:  “And indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I have another good card here, not yet enumerated. That friend and fellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons; who was he?”  “French. You don’t know him,” said the spy quickly.  “French, eh!” repeated Carton, musing and not appearing to notice him at all, though he echoed his word. “Well; he may be.”  “Is, I assure you,” said the spy; “though it’s not important.”  “Though it’s not important,” repeated Carton in the same mechanical way—“though it’s not important—No, it’s not important. No. Yet I know the face.”  “I think not. I am sure not. It can’t be,” said the spy.  “It—can’t—be,” muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and filling his glass (which fortunately was a small one) again. “Can’t—be. Spoke good French. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?”  “Provincial,” said the spy.  “No. Foreign!” cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table, as a light broke clearly on his mind. “Cly! Disguised, but the same man. We had that man before us at the Old Bailey.”  “Now, there you are hasty, sir,” said Barsad, with a smile that gave his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; “there you really give me an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years. I attended him in his last illness. He was buried in London, at the church of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I helped to lay him in his coffin.”  Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall. Tracing it to its source, he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher’s head.  “Let us be reasonable,” said the spy, “and let us be fair.To show you how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours is, I will lay before you a certificate of Cly’s burial, which I happen to have carried in my pocket-book,” with a hurried hand he produced and opened it, “ever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You may take it in your hand; it’s no forgery.”  Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His hair could not have been more violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the crumpled horn in the house that Jack built.  Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.  “That there Roger Cly, master,” said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn and iron-bound visage. “So you put him in his coffin?”  “I did.”  “Who took him out of it?”  Barsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, “What do you mean?”  “I mean,” said Mr. Cruncher, “that he warn’t never in it. No! Not he! I’ll have my head took off, if he was ever in it.”  The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in unspeakable astonishment at Jerry.  “I tell you,” said Jerry, “that you buried paving-stones and earth in that there coffin. Don’t go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was a take in. Me and two more knows it.”  “How do you know it?”  “What’s that to you? Ecod!” growled Mr. Cruncher, “it’s you I have got a old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen! I’d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.”  Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at this turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and explain himself.  “At another time, sir,” he returned, evasively, “the present time is ill-conwenient for explainin’. What I stand to, is, that he knows well  wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin. Let him say he was, in so much as a word of one syllable, and I’ll either catch hold of his throat and choke him for half a guinea;” Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this as quite a liberal offer; “or I’ll out and announce him.”  “Humph! I see one thing,” said Carton. “I hold another card, Mr. Barsad. Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the air, for you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again! A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic. A strong card—a certain Guillotine card! Do you play?”  “No!” returned the spy. “I throw up. I confess that we were so unpopular with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at the risk of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that he never would have got away at all but for that sham. Though how this man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to me.”  “Never you trouble your head about this man,” retorted the contentious Mr. Cruncher; “you’ll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman. And look here! Once more!”—Mr. Cruncher could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his liberality—“I’d catch hold of your throat and choke you for a half a guinea.”  The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and said, with more decision, “It has come to a point. I go on duty soon, and can’t overstay my time. You told me you had a proposal; what is it? Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything in my office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. In short, I should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are all desperate here. Remember! I may denounce you if I think proper, and I can swear my way through stone walls, and so can others. Now, what do you want with me?”  “Not very much. You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?”  “I tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape possible,” said the spy, firmly.  “Why need you tell me what I have not asked? You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?”  “I am sometimes.”  “You can be when you choose.”  “I can pass in and out when I choose.”  Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out upon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped. It being all spent, he said, rising:  “So far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well that the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me. Come into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone.” \n\n CHAPTER 9  The Game Made  W hile Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest tradesman’s manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs, and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry’s eyes caught his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character.  “Jerry,” said Mr. Lorry. “Come here.”  Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in advance of him.  “What have you been, besides a messenger?”  After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron, Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, “Agri cultooral character.”  “My mind misgives me much,” said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger at him, “that you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson’s as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation  of an infamous description. If you have, don’t expect me to befriend you when you get back to England. If you have, don’t expect me to keep your secret. Tellson’s shall not be imposed upon.”  “I hope, sir,” pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, “that a gentleman like yourself wot I’ve had the honour of odd jobbing till I’m grey at it, would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so—I don’t say it is, but even if it wos. And which it is to be took into account that if it wos, it wouldn’t, even then, be all o’ one side. There’d be two sides to it.There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman don’t pick up his fardens—fardens! no, nor yet his half fardens—half fardens! no, nor yet his quarter—a banking away like smoke at Tellson’s, and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going out to their own carriages—ah! equally like smoke, if not more so. Well, that ’ud be imposing, too, on Tellson’s. For you cannot sarse the goose and not the gander. And here’s Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos in the Old England times, and would be tomorrow, if cause given, a floppin’ again the business to that degree as is ruinating—stark ruinating ! Whereas them medical doctors’ wives don’t flop—catch ’em at it! Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients, and how can you rightly have one without the t’other? Then, wot with undertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot with private watch-men (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn’t get much by it, even if it wos so. And wot little a man did get, would never prosper with him, Mr. Lorry. He’d never have no good of it; he’d want all along to be out of the line, if he could see his way out, being once in—even if it wos so.”  “Ugh!” cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless. “I am shocked at the sight of you.”  “Now, what I would humbly offer to you, sir,” pursued Mr. Cruncher, “even if it wos so, which I don’t say it is—”  “Don’t prevaricate,” said Mr. Lorry.  “No, I will not , sir,” returned Mr. Cruncher, as if nothing were further from his thoughts or practice—“which I don’t say it is—wot I would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there stool, at that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed up to be a man, wot will errand you, message you, general-light-job you, till your heels is where your head is, if such should be your  wishes. If it wos so, which I still don’t say it is (for I will not pre waricate to you, sir), let that there boy keep his father’s place, and take care of his mother; don’t blow upon that boy’s father—do not do it, sir—and let that father go into the line of the reg’lar diggin’, and make amends for what he would have un-dug—if it wos so—by diggin’ of ’em in with a will, and with conwictions respectin’ the futur’ keepin’ of ’em safe. That, Mr. Lorry,” said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his discourse, “is wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. A man don’t see all this here a goin’ on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects without heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down to porterage and hardly that, without havin’ his serious thoughts of things. And these here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin’ of you fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good cause when I might have kep’ it back.”  “That at least is true,” said Mr. Lorry. “Say no more now. It may be that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in action—not in words. I want no more words.”  Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy returned from the dark room. “Adieu, Mr. Barsad,” said the former; “our arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me.”  He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When they were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done?  “Not much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access to him, once.”  Mr. Lorry’s countenance fell.  “It is all I could do,” said Carton. “To propose too much, would be to put this man’s head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was obviously the weakness of the position. There is no help for it.”  “But access to him,” said Mr. Lorry, “if it should go ill before the Tribunal, will not save him.”  “I never said it would.”  Mr. Lorry’s eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his darling, and the heavy disappointment of this second arrest, gradually weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late, and his tears fell.  “You are a good man and a true friend,” said Carton, in an altered  voice. “Forgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see my father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your sorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune, however.”  Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch, that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly unprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it.  “To return to poor Darnay,” said Carton. “Don’t tell Her of this interview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her to go to see him. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worst, to convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence.”  Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the look, and evidently understood it.  “She might think a thousand things,” Carton said, “and any of them would only add to her trouble. Don’t speak of me to her. As I said to you when I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to do any little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that. You are going to her, I hope? She must be very desolate to-night.”  “I am going now, directly.”  “I am glad of that. She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance on you. How does she look?”  “Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful.”  “Ah!”  It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh—almost like a sob. It attracted Mr. Lorry’s eyes to Carton’s face, which was turned to the fire. A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which), passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore the white riding-coat and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair, all untrimmed, hanging loose about him. His indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance of Mr. Lorry; his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had broken under the weight of his foot.  “I forgot it,” he said.  Mr. Lorry’s eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having the expression of prisoners’ faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly reminded of that expression.  “And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?” said Carton, turning to him.  “Yes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have my Leave to Pass. I was ready to go.”  They were both silent.  “Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?” said Carton, wistfully.  “I am in my seventy-eighth year.”  “You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied; trusted, respected, and looked up to?”  “I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. Indeed, I may say that I was a man of business when a boy.”  “See what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will miss you when you leave it empty!”  “A solitary old bachelor,” answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head.  “There is nobody to weep for me.”  “How can you say that? Wouldn’t She weep for you? Wouldn’t her child?”  “Yes, yes, thank God. I didn’t quite mean what I said.”  “It is a thing to thank God for; is it not?”  “Surely, surely.”  “If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night, ‘I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no regard; I have done nothing good or service-able to be remembered by!’ your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they not?”  “You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.”  Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a few moments, said:  “I should like to ask you:—Does your childhood seem far off? Do  the days when you sat at your mother’s knee, seem days of very long ago?”  Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:  “Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and nearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!), and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me.”  “I understand the feeling!” exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush. “And you are the better for it?”  “I hope so.”  Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on with his outer coat; “but you,” said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme, “you are young.”  “Yes,” said Carton. “I am not old, but my young way was never the way to age. Enough of me.”  “And of me, I am sure,” said Mr. Lorry. “Are you going out?”  “I’ll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless habits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don’t be uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning. You go to the Court to morrow?”  “Yes, unhappily.”  “I shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. My Spy will find a place for me. Take my arm, sir.”  Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets. A few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry’s destination. Carton left him there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to the prison every day. “She came out here,” he said, looking about him, “turned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in her steps.”  It was ten o’clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force, where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer, having closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.  “Good night, citizen,” said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the man eyed him inquisitively.  “Good night, citizen.”  “How goes the Republic?”  “You mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall mount to a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a Barber!”  “Do you often go to see him—”  “Shave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at work?”  “Never.”  “Go and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself, citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less than two pipes. Word of honour!”  As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire to strike the life out of him, that he turned away.  “But you are not English,” said the wood-sawyer, “though you wear English dress?”  “Yes,” said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.  “You speak like a Frenchman.”  “I am an old student here.”  “Aha, a perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman.”  “Good night, citizen.”  “But go and see that droll dog,” the little man persisted, calling after him. “And take a pipe with you!”  Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap of paper. Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered the way well, several dark and dirty streets—much dirtier than usual, for the best public thoroughfares remained un-cleansed in those times of terror—he stopped at a chemist’s shop, which the owner was closing with his own hands. A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.  Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his  counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him. “Whew!” the chemist whistled softly, as he read it. “Hi! hi! hi!”  Sydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:  “For you, citizen?”  “For me.”  “You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? You know the consequences of mixing them?”  “Perfectly.”  Certain small packets were made and given to him. He put them, one by one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for them, and deliberately left the shop. “There is nothing more to do,” said he, glancing upward at the moon, “until to-morrow. I can’t sleep.”  It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of negligence than defiance. It was the settled manner of a tired man, who had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into his road and saw its end.  Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a youth of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave. His mother had died, years before. These solemn words, which had been read at his father’s grave, arose in his mind as he went down the dark streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds sailing on high above him. “I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.”  In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow rising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death, and for to-morrow’s victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons, and still of to-morrow’s and to-morrow’s, the chain of association that brought the words home, like a rusty old ship’s anchor from the deep, might have been easily found. He did not seek it, but repeated them and went on.  With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors surrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers were said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and  profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon the gates, for Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and material, that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among the people out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its short nightly pause in fury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for the lighter streets.  Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy shoes, and trudged. But, the theatres were all well filled, and the people poured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home. At one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking for a way across the street through the mud. He carried the child over, and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.  “I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.”  Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words were in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air. Perfectly calm and steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but, he heard them always.  The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to the water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the sky. Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died, and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to Death’s dominion.  But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden of the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays. And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of light appeared to span the air between him and the sun, while the river sparkled under it.  The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial friend, in the morning stillness. He walked by the stream, far from the houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the  bank. When he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered there yet a little longer, watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the stream absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.—“Like me!”  A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then glided into his view, floated by him, and died away. As its silent track in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors, ended in the words, “I am the resurrection and the life.”  Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone. Sydney Carton drank nothing but a little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh himself, went out to the place of trial.  The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep—whom many fell away from in dread—pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd. Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there. She was there, sitting beside her father.  When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy blood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart. If there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney Carton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly.  Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure, ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. There could have been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds.  Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and good republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to morrow and the day after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators. A life-thirsting, cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St. Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empanelled to try the deer.  Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor. No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell, un-compromising, murderous business-meaning there. Every eye then sought some  other eye in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one another, before bending forward with a strained attention.  Charles Evrémonde, called Darnay. Released yesterday. Reaccused and retaken yesterday. Indictment delivered to him last night. Suspected and Denounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of tyrants, one of a race proscribed, for that they had used their abolished privileges to the infamous oppression of the people. Charles Evrémonde, called Darnay, in right of such proscription, absolutely Dead in Law.  To this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor.  The President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly?  “Openly, President.”  “By whom?”  “Three voices. Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine.”  “Good.”  “Thérèse Defarge, his wife.”  “Good.”  “Alexandre Manette, physician.”  A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doctor Manette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had been seated.  “President, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and a fraud. You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter. My daughters and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life. Who and where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband of my child!”  “Citizen Manette, be tranquil. To fail in submission to the authority of the Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law. As to what is dearer to you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the Republic.”  Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke. The President rang his bell, and with warmth resumed.  “If the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child herself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her. Listen to what is to follow. In the meanwhile, be silent!”  Frantic acclamations were again raised. Doctor Manette sat down,  with his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew closer to him. The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together, and restored the usual hand to his mouth.  Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of his having been a mere boy in the Doctor’s service, and of the release, and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him. This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work.  “You did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?”  “I believe so.”  Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: “You were one of the best patriots there. Why not say so? You were a cannon ier that day there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when it fell. Patriots, I speak the truth!”  It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the audience, thus assisted the proceedings. The President rang his bell; but, The Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, “I defy that bell!” wherein she was likewise much commended.  “Inform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille, citizen.”  “I knew,” said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the bottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him; “I knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower. I knew it from himself. He knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five, North Tower, when he made shoes under my care. As I serve my gun that day, I resolve, when the place shall fall, to examine that cell. It falls. I mount to the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a gaoler. I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney, where a stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. This is that written paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens of the writing of Doctor Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette. I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of the President.”  “Let it be read.”  In a dead silence and stillness—the prisoner under trial looking  lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them—the paper was read, as follows. \n\n CHAPTER 10  The Substance of the Shadow  “ I , Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais and afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year 1767. I write it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty. I design to secrete it in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a place of concealment for it. Some pitying hand may find it there, when I and my sorrows are dust.  “These words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity. Hope has quite departed from my breast. I know from terrible warnings I have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired, but I solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right mind—that my memory is exact and circumstantial—and that I write the truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether they be ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgment-seat.  “One cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I think the twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air, at an hour’s distance from my place of residence in the Street of the School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind me, driven very fast. As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a voice called to the driver to stop.  “The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses, and the same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before I came up with it. I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door, I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice, and (as far as I could see) face too.  “ ‘You are Doctor Manette?’ said one.  “ ‘I am.’  “ ‘Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,’ said the other; ‘the young physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in Paris?’  “ ‘Gentlemen,’ I returned, ‘I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so graciously.’  “ ‘We have been to your residence,’ said the first, ‘and not being so fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of overtaking you. Will you please to enter the carriage?’  “The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door. They were armed. I was not.  “ ‘Gentlemen,’ said I, ‘pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to which I am summoned.’  “The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. ‘Doctor, your clients are people of condition. As to the nature of the case, our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than we can describe it. Enough. Will you please to enter the carriage?’  “I could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence. They both entered after me—the last springing in, after putting up the steps. The carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.  “I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. I have no doubt that it is, word for word, the same. I describe everything exactly as it    took place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task. Where I make the broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and put my paper in its hiding-place.  \n In the Bastille \n![020](bano_9781411433236_oeb_020_r1.jpg)\n\n![021](bano_9781411433236_oeb_021_r1.jpg)\n “The carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and emerged upon the country road. At two-thirds of a league from the Barrier—I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards when I traversed it—it struck out of the main avenue, and presently stopped at a solitary house. We all three alighted, and walked, by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed, to the door of the house. It was not opened immediately, in answer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two conductors struck the man who opened it, with his heavy riding-glove, across the face.  “There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention, for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs. But, the other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner with his arm; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly alike, that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers.  “From the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found locked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and had re-locked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber. I was conducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we ascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain, lying on a bed.  “The patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not much past twenty. Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms were bound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. I noticed that these bonds were all portions of a gentleman’s dress. On one of them, which was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble, and the letter E.  “I saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient; for, in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the edge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth, and was in danger of suffocation. My first act was to put out my hand to relieve her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in the corner caught my sight.  “I turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm her and keep her down, and looked into her face. Her eyes were dilated and wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the words, ‘My husband, my father, and my brother!’ and then counted up to twelve, and said, ‘Hush!’ For an instant, and no more, she would pause to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and she would repeat the cry, ‘My husband, my father, and my brother!’ and would count up to twelve, and say ‘Hush!’ There was no variation in the order, or the manner. There was no cessation, but the regular moment’s pause, in the utterance of these sounds.  “ ‘How long,’ I asked, ‘has this lasted?’  “To distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the younger; by the elder, I mean him who exercised the most authority. It was the elder who replied, ‘Since about this hour last night.’  “ ‘She has a husband, a father, and a brother?’  “ ‘A brother.’  “ ‘I do not address her brother?’  “He answered with great contempt, ‘No.’  “She has some recent association with the number twelve?’  “The younger brother impatiently rejoined, ‘With twelve o’clock!’  “ ‘See, gentlemen,’ said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast, ‘how useless I am, as you have brought me! If I had known what I was coming to see, I could have come provided. As it is, time must be lost. There are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.’  “The elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, ‘There is a case of medicines here,’ and brought it from a closet, and put it on the table. \n![022](bano_9781411433236_oeb_022_r1.jpg)\n “I opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to my lips. If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those.  “ ‘Do you doubt them?’ asked the younger brother.  “ ‘You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,’ I replied, and said no more.  “I made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many efforts, the dose that I desired to give. As I intended to repeat it after  a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then sat down by the side of the bed. There was a timid and suppressed woman in attendance (wife of the man downstairs), who had retreated into a corner. The house was damp and decayed, indifferently furnished—evidently, recently occupied and temporarily used. Some thick old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the sound of the shrieks. They continued to be uttered in their regular succession, with the cry, ‘My husband, my father, and my brother!’ the counting up to twelve, and ‘Hush!’ The frenzy was so violent, that I had not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms, but, I had looked to them, to see that they were not painful. The only spark of encouragement in the case, was, that my hand upon the sufferer’s breast had this much soothing influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the figure. It had no effect upon the cries: no pendulum could be more regular.  “For the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat by the side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on, before the elder said:  “ ‘There is another patient.’  “I was startled and asked, ‘Is it a pressing case?’  “ ‘You had better see,’ he carelessly answered; and took up a light. \n![023](bano_9781411433236_oeb_023_r1.jpg)\n “The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which was a species of loft over a stable. There was a low plastered ceiling to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and there were beams across. Hay and straw were stored in that portion of the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand. I had to pass through that part, to get at the other. My memory is circumstantial and unshaken. I try it with these details, and I see them all, in this my cell in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my captivity, as I saw them all that night.  “On some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head, lay a handsome peasant-boy—a boy of not more than seventeen at the most. He lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand clenched on his breast, and his glaring eyes looking straight upward. I could not see where his wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him; but, I could see that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point.  “ ‘I am a doctor, my poor fellow,’ said I. ‘Let me examine it.’  “ ‘I do not want it examined,’ he answered; ‘let it be.’  “It was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand away. The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twenty-four hours before, but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to without delay. He was then dying fast. As I turned my eyes to the elder brother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was ebbing out, as if he were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all as if he were a fellow-creature.  “ ‘How has this been done, monsieur?’ said I.  “ ‘A crazed young common dog! A serf! Forced my brother to draw upon him, and has fallen by my brother’s sword—like a gentleman.’  “There was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this answer. The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his vermin kind. He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about the boy, or about his fate.  “The boy’s eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and they now slowly moved to me.  “ ‘Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs are proud too, sometimes. They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill us; but we have a little pride left, sometimes. She—have you seen her, Doctor?’  “The shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the distance. He referred to them, as if she were lying in our presence.  “I said, ‘I have seen her.’  “ ‘She is my sister, Doctor. They have had their shameful rights, these Nobles, in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years, but we have had good girls among us. I know it, and have heard my father say so. She was a good girl. She was betrothed to a good young man, too: a tenant of his. We were all tenants of his—that man’s who stands there. The other is his brother, the worst of a bad race.’  “It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force to speak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.  “ ‘We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common dogs are by those superior Beings—taxed by him without mercy, obliged to work for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his mill, obliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and forbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pillaged and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat, we ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed, that his people should not see it and take it from us—I say, we were so robbed, and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we should most pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our miserable race die out!’  “I had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth like a fire. I had supposed that it must be latent in the people somewhere; but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the dying boy.  “ ‘Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married. He was ailing at that time, poor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend and comfort him in our cottage—our dog-hut, as that man would call it. She had not been married many weeks, when that man’s brother saw her and admired her, and asked that man to lend her to him—for what are husbands among us! He was willing enough, but my sister was good and virtuous, and hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine. What did the two then, to persuade her husband to use his influence with her, to make her willing?’  “The boy’s eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to the looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true. The two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in this Bastille; the gentleman’s all negligent indifference; the peasant’s, all trodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge.  “ ‘You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to harness us common dogs to carts, and drive us. They so harnessed him and drove him. You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in their grounds all night, quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep may not be disturbed. They kept him out in the unwholesome mists at night, and ordered him back into his harness in the day. But he was not persuaded. No! Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed—if he could find food—he sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the bell, and died on her bosom.’  “Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to tell all his wrong. He forced back the gathering shadows of death, as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to cover his wound.  “ ‘Then, with that man’s permission and even with his aid, his brother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told his brother—and what that is, will not be long unknown to you, Doctor, if it is now—his brother took her away—for his pleasure and diversion, for a little while. I saw her pass me on the road. When I took the tidings home, our father’s heart burst; he never spoke one of the words that filled it. I took my young sister (for I have another) to a place beyond the reach of this man, and where, at least, she will never be his vassal. Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed in—a common dog, but sword in hand.—Where is the loft window? It was somewhere here?’  “The room was darkening to his sight; the world was narrowing around him. I glanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were trampled over the floor, as if there had been a struggle.  “ ‘She heard me, and ran in. I told her not to come near us till he was dead. He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then struck at me with a whip. But I, though a common dog, so struck at him as to make him draw. Let him break into as many pieces as he will, the sword that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend himself—thrust at me with all his skill for his life.’  “My glance had fallen but a few moments before, on the fragments of a broken sword, lying among the hay. That weapon was a gentleman’s. In another place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier’s.  “ ‘Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up. Where is he?’  “ ‘He is not here,’ I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that he referred to the brother.  “ ‘He! Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me. Where is the man who was here? Turn my face to him.’  “I did so, raising the boy’s head against my knee. But, invested for the moment with extraordinary power, he raised himself completely: obliging me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him.  “ ‘Marquis,’ said the boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide, and his right hand raised, ‘in the days when all these things are to be  answered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to answer for them. I mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign that I do it. In the days when all these things are to be answered for, I summon your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them separately. I mark this cross of blood upon him, as a sign that I do it.’  “Twice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his forefinger drew a cross in the air. He stood for an instant with the finger yet raised, and, as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him down dead. \n![024](bano_9781411433236_oeb_024_r1.jpg)\n “When I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her raving in precisely the same order and continuity. I knew that this might last for many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the grave.  “I repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of the bed until the night was far advanced. She never abated the piercing quality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order of her words. They were always ‘My husband, my father, and my brother! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Hush!’  “This lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her. I had come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began to falter. I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and by-and-by she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.  “It was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and fearful storm. I released her arms, and called the woman to assist me to compose her figure and the dress she had torn. It was then that I knew her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being a mother have arisen; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had had of her.  “ ‘Is she dead?’ asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the elder brother, coming booted into the room from his horse.  “ ‘Not dead,’ said I; ‘but like to die.’  “ ‘What strength there is in these common bodies!’ he said, looking down at her with some curiosity.  “ ‘There is prodigious strength,’ I answered him, ‘in sorrow and despair.’  “He first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them. He  moved a chair with his foot near to mine, ordered the woman away, and said in a subdued voice,  “ ‘Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I recommended that your aid should be invited. Your reputation is high, and, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful of your interest. The things that you see here, are things to be seen, and not spoken of.’  “I listened to the patient’s breathing, and avoided answering.  “ ‘Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?’  “ ‘Monsieur,’ said I, ‘in my profession, the communications of patients are always received in confidence.’ I was guarded in my answer, for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen.  “Her breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the pulse and the heart. There was life, and no more. Looking round as I resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me. \n![025](bano_9781411433236_oeb_025_r1.jpg)\n “I write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness, that I must abridge this narrative. There is no confusion or failure in my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers.  “She lingered for a week. Towards the last, I could understand some few syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips. She asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her. It was in vain that I asked her for her family name. She faintly shook her head upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the boy had done.  “I had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told the brothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day. Until then, though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there. But when it came to that, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her; as if—the thought passed through my mind—I were dying too.  “I always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger brother’s (as I call him) having crossed swords with a peasant, and that peasant a boy. The only consideration that appeared to affect  the mind of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading to the family, and was ridiculous. As often as I caught the younger brother’s eyes, their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply, for knowing what I knew from the boy. He was smoother and more polite to me than the elder; but I saw this. I also saw that I was an incumbrance in the mind of the elder, too.  “My patient died, two hours before midnight—at a time, by my watch, answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her. I was alone with her, when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side, and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.  “The brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to ride away. I had heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their boots with their riding-whips, and loitering up and down.  “ ‘At last she is dead?’ said the elder, when I went in.  “ ‘She is dead,’ said I.  “ ‘I congratulate you, my brother,’ were his words as he turned round.  “He had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking. He now gave me a rouleau of gold. I took it from his hand, but laid it on the table. I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept nothing.  “ ‘Pray excuse me,’ said I. ‘Under the circumstances, no.’  “They exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to them, and we parted without another word on either side. \n![026](bano_9781411433236_oeb_026_r1.jpg)\n “I am weary, weary, weary—worn down by misery. I cannot read what I have written with this gaunt hand.  “Early in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a little box, with my name on the outside. From the first, I had anxiously considered what I ought to do. I decided, that day, to write privately to the Minister, stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been summoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect, stating all the circumstances. I knew what Court influence was, and what the immunities of the Nobles were, and I expected that the matter would never be heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind. I had kept the matter a profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved to state in my letter. I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed.  “I was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that night. I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it. It was the last day of the year. The letter was lying before me just completed, when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me. \n![027](bano_9781411433236_oeb_027_r1.jpg)\n “I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself. It is so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so dreadful.  “The lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long life. She was in great agitation. She presented herself to me as the wife of the Marquis St. Evrémonde. I connected the title by which the boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I had seen that nobleman very lately.  “My memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of our conversation. I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and I know not at what times I may be watched. She had in part suspected, and in part discovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her husband’s share in it, and my being resorted to. She did not know that the girl was dead. Her hope had been, she said in great distress, to show her, in secret, a woman’s sympathy. Her hope had been to avert the wrath of Heaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering many.  “She had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living, and her greatest desire was, to help that sister. I could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing. Her inducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the hope that I could tell her the name and place of abode. Whereas, to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both. \n![028](bano_9781411433236_oeb_028_r1.jpg)\n “These scraps of paper fail me. One was taken from me, with a warning, yesterday. I must finish my record to-day.  “She was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her marriage. How could she be! The brother distrusted and disliked her, and his influence was all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him, and in dread of her husband too. When I handed her down to the door, there was a child, a pretty boy from two to three years old, in her carriage.  “ ‘For his sake, Doctor,’ she said, pointing to him in tears, ‘I would do all I can to make what poor amends I can. He will never prosper in his inheritance otherwise. I have a presentiment that if no other innocent atonement is made for this, it will one day be required of him. What I have left to call my own—it is little beyond the worth of a few jewels—I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow, with the compassion and lamenting of his dead mother, on this injured family, if the sister can be discovered.’  “She kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, ‘It is for thine own dear sake. Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?’ The child answered her bravely, ‘Yes!’ I kissed her hand, and she took him in her arms, and went away caressing him. I never saw her more.  “As she had mentioned her husband’s name in the faith that I knew it, I added no mention of it to my letter. I sealed my letter, and, not trusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day.  “That night, the last night of the year, towards nine o’clock, a man in a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly followed my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, upstairs. When my servant came into the room where I sat with my wife—O my wife, beloved of my heart! My fair young English wife!—we saw the man, who was supposed to be at the gate, standing silent behind him.  “An urgent case in the Rue St. Honoré, he said. It would not detain me, he had a coach in waiting.  “It brought me here, it brought me to my grave. When I was clear of the house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind, and my arms were pinioned. The two brothers crossed the road from a dark corner, and identified me with a single gesture. The Marquis took from his pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his foot. Not a word was spoken. I was brought here, I was brought to my living grave.  “If it had pleased God to put it in the hard heart of either of the  brothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of my dearest wife—so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or dead—I might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them. But, now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that they have no part in His mercies. And them and their descendants, to the last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for. I denounce them to Heaven and to earth.”  \nA terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done. A sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but blood. The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time, and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.  Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show how the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other captured Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding their time. Little need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal register. The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have sustained him in that place that day, against such denunciation.  And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was a well-known citizen, his own attached friend, the father of his wife. One of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of the questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and self-immolations on the people’s altar. Therefore when the President said (else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the good physician of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and would doubtless feel a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of human sympathy.  “Much influence around him, has that Doctor?” murmured Madame Defarge, smiling to The Vengeance. “Save him now, my Doctor, save him!”  At every juryman’s vote, there was a roar. Another and another. Roar and roar.  Unanimously voted. At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the People. Back to the Conciergerie, and Death within four-and-twenty hours! \n\n CHAPTER 11  Dusk  T he wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under the sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken. But, she uttered no sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.  The judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors, the tribunal adjourned. The quick noise and movement of the court’s emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie stood stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her face but love and consolation.  “If I might touch him! If I might embrace him once! O, good citizens, if you would have so much compassion for us!”  There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had taken him last night, and Barsad. The people had all poured out to the show in the streets. Barsad proposed to the rest, “Let her embrace him then; it is but a moment.” It was silently acquiesced in, and they passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by leaning over the dock, could fold her in his arms.  “Farewell, dear darling of my soul. My parting blessing on my love. We shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!”  They were her husband’s words, as he held her to his bosom.  “I can bear it, dear Charles. I am supported from above: don’t suffer for me. A parting blessing for our child.”  “I send it to her by you. I kiss her by you. I say farewell to her by you.”  “My husband. No! A moment!” He was tearing himself apart from    her. “We shall not be separated long. I feel that this will break my heart by-and-by; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her, God will raise up friends for her, as He did for me.”  \n After the Sentence \n![029](bano_9781411433236_oeb_029_r1.jpg)\n Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to both of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:  “No, no! What have you done, what have you done, that you should kneel to us! We know now, what a struggle you made of old. We know now, what you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when you knew it. We know now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and conquered, for her dear sake. We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and duty. Heaven be with you!”  Her father’s only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair, and wring them with a shriek of anguish.  “It could not be otherwise,” said the prisoner. “All things have worked together as they have fallen out. It was the always-vain endeavour to discharge my poor mother’s trust that first brought my fatal presence near you. Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning. Be comforted, and forgive me. Heaven bless you!”  As he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking after him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a comforting smile. As he went out at the prisoners’ door, she turned, laid her head lovingly on her father’s breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his feet.  Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved, Sydney Carton came and took her up. Only her father and Mr. Lorry were with her. His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head. Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity—that had a flush of pride in it.  “Shall I take her to a coach? I shall never feel her weight.”  He carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a coach. Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat beside the driver.  When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of the street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and carried her up the staircase to their rooms. There, he laid her down on a couch, where her child and Miss Pross wept over her.  “Don’t recall her to herself,” he said, softly, to the latter, “she is better so. Don’t revive her to consciousness, while she only faints.”  “Oh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!” cried little Lucie, springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. “Now that you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to save papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?”  He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face. He put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother.  “Before I go,” he said, and paused—“I may kiss her?”  It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was nearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grand-children when she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, “A life you love.”  When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry and her father, who were following, and said to the latter:  “You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least be tried. These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?”  “Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did.” He returned the answer in great trouble, and very slowly.  “Try them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few and short, but try.”  “I intend to try. I will not rest a moment.”  “That’s well. I have known such energy as yours do great things before now—though never,” he added, with a smile and a sigh together, “such great things as this. But try! Of little worth as life is when we misuse it, it is worth that effort. It would cost nothing to lay down if it were not.”  “I will go,” said Doctor Manette, “to the Prosecutor and the President straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name. I will write too, and—But stay! There is a celebration in the streets, and no one will be accessible until dark.”  “That’s true. Well! It is forlorn hope at the best, and not much the forlorner for being delayed until dark. I should like to know how you speed; though, mind! I expect nothing! When are you likely to have seen these dread powers, Doctor Manette?”  “Immediately after dark, I should hope. Within an hour or two from this.”  “It will be dark soon after four. Let us stretch the hour or two. If I go to Mr. Lorry’s at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either from our friend or from yourself?”  “Yes.”  “May you prosper!”  Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him on the shoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn.  “I have no hope,” said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.  “Nor have I.”  “If any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to spare him—which is a large supposition; for what is his life, or any man’s to them!—I doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the court.”  “And so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound.”  Mr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face upon it.  “Don’t despond,” said Carton, very gently; “don’t grieve. I encouraged Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be consolatory to her. Otherwise, she might think ‘his life was wantonly thrown away or wasted,’ and that might trouble her.”  “Yes, yes, yes,” returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, “you are right. But he will perish; there is no real hope.”  “Yes. He will perish: there is no real hope,” echoed Carton. And walked with a settled step, down-stairs. \n\n CHAPTER 12  Darkness  S ydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go. “At Tellson’s banking-house at nine,” he said, with a musing face. “Shall I do well, in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It is best that these people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound precaution, and may be a necessary preparation. But care, care, care! Let me think it out!”  Checking his steps, which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought in his mind to its possible consequences. His first impression was confirmed. “It is best,” he said, finally resolved, “that these people should know there is such a man as I here.” And he turned his face towards Saint Antoine.  Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in the Saint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one who knew the city well, to find his house without asking any question. Having ascertained its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner. For the first time in many years, he had no strong drink. Since last night he had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry’s hearth like a man who had done with it.  It was as late as seven o’clock when he awoke refreshed, and went out into the streets again. As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and his wild hair. This done, he went on direct to Defarge’s, and went in.  There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of the restless fingers and the croaking voice. This man, whom he had seen upon the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the Defarges, man and wife. The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like a regular member of the establishment.  As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent  French) for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced to him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.  He repeated what he had already said.  “English?” asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows.  After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word were slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong foreign accent, “Yes, madame, yes. I am English!”  Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its meaning, he heard her say, “I swear to you, like Evrémonde!”  Defarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening.  “How?”  “Good evening.”  “Oh! Good evening, citizen,” filling his glass. “Ah! and good wine. I drink to the Republic.”  Defarge went back to the counter, and said, “Certainly, a little like.” Madame sternly retorted, “I tell you a good deal like.” Jacques Three pacifically remarked, “He is so much in your mind, see you, madame.” The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, “Yes, my faith! And you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more to-morrow!”  Carton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face. They were all leaning their arms on the counter close together, speaking low. After a silence of a few moments, during which they all looked towards him without disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed their conversation.  “It is true what madame says,” observed Jacques Three. “Why stop? There is great force in that. Why stop?”  “Well, well,” reasoned Defarge, “but one must stop somewhere. After all, the question is still where?”  “At extermination,” said madame.  “Magnificent!” croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly approved.  “Extermination is good doctrine, my wife,” said Defarge, rather troubled; “in general, I say nothing against it. But this Doctor has suffered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when the paper was read.”  “I have observed his face!” repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily. “Yes. I have observed his face. I have observed his face to be not the face of a true friend of the Republic. Let him take care of his face!”  “And you have observed, my wife,” said Defarge, in a deprecatory manner, “the anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish to him!”  “I have observed his daughter,” repeated madame; “yes, I have observed his daughter, more times than one. I have observed her to-day, and I have observed her other days. I have observed her in the court, and I have observed her in the street by the prison. Let me but lift my finger—!” She seemed to raise it (the listener’s eyes were always on his paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as if the axe had dropped.  “The citizeness is superb!” croaked the Juryman.  “She is an Angel!” said The Vengeance, and embraced her.  “As to thee,” pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, “if it depended on thee—which, happily, it does not—thou wouldst rescue this man even now.”  “No!” protested Defarge. “Not if to lift this glass would do it! But I would leave the matter there. I say, stop there.”  “See you then, Jacques,” said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; “and see you, too, my little Vengeance; see you both! Listen! For other crimes as tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my register, doomed to destruction and extermination. Ask my husband, is that so.”  “It is so,” assented Defarge, without being asked.  “In the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he finds this paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot, by the light of this lamp. Ask him, is that so.”  “It is so,” assented Defarge.  “That night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the lamp is burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate. Ask him, is that so.”  “It is so,” assented Defarge again.  “I communicate to him that secret. I smite this bosom with these two hands as I smite it now, and I tell him, ‘Defarge, I was brought up among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured by the two Evrémonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my family. Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground was my sister, that husband was my sister’s husband, that unborn child was their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father, those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things descends to me!’ Ask him, is that so.”  “It is so,” assented Defarge once more.  “Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop,” returned madame; “but don’t tell me.”  Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of her wrath—the listener could feel how white she was, without seeing her—and both highly commended it. Defarge, a weak minority, interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply. “Tell the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!”  Customers entered, and the group was broken up. The English customer paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked, as a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace. Madame Defarge took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in pointing out the road. The English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and deep.  But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the prison wall. At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present himself in Mr. Lorry’s room again, where he found the old gentleman walking to and fro in restless anxiety. He said he had been with Lucie until now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and keep his appointment. Her father had not been seen, since he quitted the banking-house towards four o’clock. She had some faint hopes that his mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. He had been more than five hours gone: where could he be?  Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he  should go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight. In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor.  He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette did not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him, and brought none. Where could he be?  They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on the stairs. The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all was lost.  Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that time traversing the streets, was never known. As he stood staring at them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything.  “I cannot find it,” said he, “and I must have it. Where is it?”  His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look straying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor.  “Where is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I can’t find it. What have they done with my work? Time presses: I must finish those shoes.”  They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.  “Come, come!” said he, in a whimpering miserable way; “let me get to work. Give me my work.”  Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the ground, like a distracted child.  “Don’t torture a poor forlorn wretch,” he implored them, with a dreadful cry; “but give me my work! What is to become of us, if those shoes are not done to-night?”  Lost, utterly lost!  It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore him, that—as if by agreement—they each put a hand upon his shoulder, and soothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he should have his work presently. He sank into the chair, and brooded over the embers, and shed tears. As if all that had happened since the garret time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him shrink into the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping.  Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this  spectacle of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. His lonely daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both too strongly. Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with one meaning in their faces. Carton was the first to speak:  “The last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he had better be taken to her. But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to me? Don’t ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make, and exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason—a good one.”  “I do not doubt it,” answered Mr. Lorry. “Say on.”  The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously rocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the night.  Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his feet. As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to carry the list of his day’s duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton took it up, and there was a folded paper in it. “We should look at this!” he said. Mr. Lorry nodded his consent. He opened it, and exclaimed, “Thank GOD!”  “What is it?” asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly.  “A moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First,” he put his hand in his coat, and took another paper from it, “that is the certificate which enables me to pass out of this city. Look at it.You see—Sydney Carton, an Englishman?”  Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.  “Keep it for me until to-morrow. I shall see him to-morrow, you remember, and I had better not take it into the prison.”  “Why not?”  “I don’t know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doctor Manette has carried about him. It is a similar certificate, enabling him and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the frontier? You see?”  “Yes!”  “Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil, yesterday. When is it dated? But no matter; don’t stay to look; put it up carefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I never  doubted until within this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper. It is good, until recalled. But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason to think, will be.”  “They are not in danger?”  “They are in great danger. They are in danger of denunciation by Madame Defarge. I know it from her own lips. I have overheard words of that woman’s, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in strong colours. I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy. He confirms me. He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison-wall, is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by Madame Defarge as to his having seen Her”—he never mentioned Lucie’s name—“making signs and signals to prisoners. It is easy to foresee that the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will involve her life—and perhaps her child’s—and perhaps her father’s—for both have been seen with her at that place. Don’t look so horrified. You will save them all.”  “Heaven grant I may, Carton! But how?”  “I am going to tell you how. It will depend on you, and it could depend on no better man. This new denunciation will certainly not take place until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days afterwards; more probably a week afterwards. You know it is a capital crime, to mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine. She and her father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this woman (the inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described) would wait to add that strength to her case, and make herself doubly sure. You follow me?”  “So attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that for the moment I lose sight,” touching the back of the Doctor’s chair, “even of this distress.”  “You have money, and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast as quickly as the journey can be made. Your preparations have been completed for some days, to return to England. Early to morrow have your horses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two o’clock in the afternoon.”  “It shall be done!”  His manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr. Lorry caught the flame, and was as quick as youth.  “You are a noble heart. Did I say we could depend upon no better man? Tell her, tonight, what you know of her danger as involving her child and her father. Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own fair head beside her husband’s cheerfully.” He faltered for an instant; then went on as before. “For the sake of her child and her father, press upon her the necessity of leaving Paris, with them and you, at that hour. Tell her that it was her husband’s last arrangement. Tell her that more depends upon it than she dare believe, or hope. You think that her father, even in this sad state, will submit himself to her; do you not?”  “I am sure of it.”  “I thought so. Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in the court-yard here, even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage. The moment I come to you, take me in, and drive away.”  “I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?”  “You have my certificate in your hand with the rest, you know, and will reserve my place. Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied, and then for England!”  “Why, then,” said Mr. Lorry, grasping his eager but so firm and steady hand, “it does not all depend on one old man, but I shall have a young and ardent man at my side.”  “By the help of Heaven you shall! Promise me solemnly that nothing will influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one another.”  “Nothing, Carton.”  “Remember these words to-morrow: change the course, or delay in it—for any reason—and no life can possibly be saved, and many lives must inevitably be sacrificed.”  “I will remember them. I hope to do my part faithfully.”  “And I hope to do mine. Now, good-bye!”  Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though he even put the old man’s hand to his lips, he did not part from him then. He helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers, as to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth to find where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought to have. He walked on the other side of it and protected it to the court-yard of the house where the afflicted heart—so happy in the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to it—outwatched the awful night. He entered the  court-yard and remained there for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of her room. Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and a Farewell. \n\n CHAPTER 13  Fifty- two  I n the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited their fate. They were in number as the weeks of the year. Fifty-two were to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless everlasting sea. Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants were appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday, the blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set apart.  Two score and twelve were told off. From the farmer-general of seventy, whose riches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty, whose poverty and obscurity could not save her. Physical diseases, engendered in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees; and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering, intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally without distinction.  Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. In every line of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him, that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could avail him nothing.  Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear. His hold on life was strong, and it was very, very hard to loosen; by gradual efforts and degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded, this was closed again. There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts, a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contended against resignation. If, for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and child who had to live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a selfish thing.  But, all this was at first. Before long, the consideration that there was no disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate him. Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude. So, by degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his thoughts much higher, and draw comfort down.  Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had travelled thus far on his last way. Being allowed to purchase the means of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should be extinguished.  He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing of her father’s imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself, and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father’s and uncle’s responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. He had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished, was the one condition—fully intelligible now—that her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her, for her father’s sake, never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered there, and which had been described to all the world. He besought her—though he added that he knew it was needless—to console her father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten him self for their joint sakes. Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their dear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her father.  To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care. And he told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be tending.  To Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly affairs. That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm attachment, all was done. He never thought of Carton. His mind was so full of the others, that he never once thought of him.  He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out. When he lay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with this world.  But, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining forms. Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had nothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of heart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and he had never gone away. A pause of forgetfulness, and then he had even suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there was no difference in him. Another pause of oblivion, and he awoke in the sombre morning, unconscious where he was or what had happened, until it flashed upon his mind, “this is the day of my death!”  Thus, had he come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two heads were to fall. And now, while he was composed, and hoped that he could meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his waking thoughts, which was very difficult to master.  He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life. How high it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be stood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed red, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be the first, or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in no wise directed by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless times. Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no fear. Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.  The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the numbers he would never hear again. Nine gone for ever, ten gone for ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away. After a hard contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed him, he had got the better of it. He walked up and down, softly repeating their names to himself. The worst of the strife was over. He could walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for himself and for them.  Twelve gone for ever.  He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he would be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily and slowly through the streets. Therefore, he resolved to keep Two before his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen him self in the interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.  Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a very different man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at La Force, he heard One struck away from him, without surprise. The hour had measured like most other hours. Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his recovered self-possession, he thought, “There is but another now,” and turned to walk again.  Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door. He stopped.  The key was put in the lock, and turned. Before the door was opened, or as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: “He has never seen me here; I have kept out of his way. Go you in alone; I wait near. Lose no time!”  The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him face to face, quiet, intent upon him, with the light of a smile on his features, and a cautionary finger on his lip, Sydney Carton.  There was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for the first moment, the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own imagining. But, he spoke, and it was his voice; he took the prisoner’s hand, and it was his real grasp.  “Of all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me?” he said.  “I could not believe it to be you. I can scarcely believe it now. You  are not”—the apprehension came suddenly into his mind—“a prisoner?”  “No. I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers here, and in virtue of it I stand before you. I come from her—your wife, dear Darnay.”  The prisoner wrung his hand.  “I bring you a request from her.”  “What is it?”  “A most earnest, pressing, and emphatic entreaty, addressed to you in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you, that you well remember.”  The prisoner turned his face partly aside.  “You have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have no time to tell you. You must comply with it—take off those boots you wear, and draw on these of mine.”  There was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner. Carton, pressing forward, had already, with the speed of lightning, got him down into it, and stood over him, barefoot.  “Draw on these boots of mine. Put your hands to them, put your will to them. Quick!”  “Carton, there is no escaping from this place; it never can be done. You will only die with me. It is madness.”  “It would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I? When I ask you to pass out at that door, tell me it is madness and remain here. Change that cravat for this of mine, that coat for this of mine. While you do it, let me take this ribbon from your hair, and shake out your hair like this of mine!”  With wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and action, that appeared quite supernatural, he forced all these changes upon him. The prisoner was like a young child in his hands.  “Carton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished, it never can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.”  “Do I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that, refuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand steady enough to write?”  “It was when you came in.”  “Steady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend, quick!”  Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table, Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him.  “Write exactly as I speak.”  “To whom do I address it?”  “To no one.” Carton still had his hand in his breast.  “Do I date it?”  “No.”  The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over him with his hand in his breast, looked down.  “ ‘If you remember,’ ” said Carton, dictating, “ ‘the words that passed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it. You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them.’ ”  He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon something.  “Have you written ‘forget them!’ ” Carton asked.  “I have. Is that a weapon in your hand?”  “No; I am not armed.”  “What is it in your hand?”  “You shall know directly. Write on; there are but a few words more.” He dictated again. “ ‘I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove them. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief.’ ” As he said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writer’s face.  The pen dropped from Darnay’s fingers on the table, and he looked about him vacantly.  “What vapour is that?” he asked.  “Vapour?”  “Something that crossed me?”  “I am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the pen and finish. Hurry, hurry!”  As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton  with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton—his hand again in his breast—looked steadily at him.  “Hurry, hurry!”  The prisoner bent over the paper, once more.  “ ‘If it had been otherwise,’ ” Carton’s hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; “ ‘I never should have used the longer opportunity. If it had been otherwise;’ ” the hand was at the prisoner’s face; “ ‘I should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been otherwise—’ ” Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs.  Carton’s hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton’s hand was close and firm at his nostrils, and Carton’s left arm caught him round the waist. For a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched insensible on the ground.  Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn. Then, he softly called, “Enter there! Come in!” and the Spy presented himself.  “You see?” said Carton, looking up, as he kneeled on one knee beside the insensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: “is your hazard very great?”  “Mr. Carton,” the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his fingers, “my hazard is not that , in the thick of business here, if you are true to the whole of your bargain.”  “Don’t fear me. I will be true to the death.”  “You must be, Mr. Carton, if the tale of fifty-two is to be right. Being made right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear.”  “Have no fear! I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and the rest will soon be far from here, please God! Now, get assistance and take me to the coach.”  “You?” said the Spy nervously.  “Him, man, with whom I have exchanged. You go out at the gate by which you brought me in?”  “Of course.”  “I was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter  now you take me out. The parting interview has overpowered me. Such a thing has happened here, often, and too often. Your life is in your own hands. Quick! Call assistance!”  “You swear not to betray me?” said the trembling Spy, as he paused for a last moment.  “Man, man!” returned Carton, stamping his foot; “have I sworn by no solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the precious moments now? Take him yourself to the court-yard you know of, place him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr. Lorry, tell him yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my words of last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!”  The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his forehead on his hands. The Spy returned immediately, with two men.  “How, then?” said one of them, contemplating the fallen figure. “So afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of Sainte Guillotine?”  “A good patriot,” said the other, “could hardly have been more afflicted if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank.”  They raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had brought to the door and bent to carry it away.  “The time is short, Evrémonde,” said the Spy, in a warning voice.  “I know it well,” answered Carton. “Be careful of my friend, I entreat you, and leave me.”  “Come, then, my children,” said Barsad. “Lift him, and come away!”  The door closed, and Carton was left alone. Straining his powers of listening to the utmost, he listened for any sound that might denote suspicion or alarm. There was none. Keys turned, doors clashed, footsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry made, that seemed unusual. Breathing more freely in a little while, he sat down at the table, and listened again until the clock struck Two.  Sounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then began to be audible. Several doors were opened in succession and finally his own. A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely saying, “Follow me, Evrémonde!” and he followed into a large dark room, at a distance. It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows within, and what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern the others who were brought there to have their arms bound. Some were standing; some seated. Some were lamenting, and in restless motion; but, these were few. The great majority were silent and still, looking fixedly at the ground.  As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two were brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace him, as having a knowledge of him. It thrilled him with a great dread of discovery; but the man went on. A very few moments after that, a young woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose from the seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak to him.  “Citizen Evrémonde,” she said, touching him with her cold hand. “I am a poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force.”  He murmured for answer: “True. I forget what you were accused of?”  “Plots. Though the just Heaven knows I am innocent of any. Is it likely? Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me?”  The forlorn smile with which she said it, so touched him, that tears started from his eyes.  “I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evrémonde, but I have done nothing. I am not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good to us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be, Citizen Evrémonde. Such a poor weak little creature!”  As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to, it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.  “I heard you were released, Citizen Evrémonde. I hoped it was true?”  “It was. But, I was again taken and condemned.”  “If I may ride with you, Citizen Evrémonde, will you let me hold your hand? I am not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give me more courage.”  As the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt in them, and then astonishment. He pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn young fingers, and touched his lips.  “Are you dying for him?” she whispered.  “And his wife and child. Hush! Yes.”  “O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?”  “Hush! Yes, my poor sister; to the last.”  \nThe same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that same hour of the early afternoon, on the Barrier with the crowd about it, when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined.  “Who goes here? Whom have we within? Papers!”  The papers are handed out, and read.  “Alexandre Manette. Physician. French. Which is he?”  This is he; this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old man pointed out.  “Apparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his right mind? The Revolution-fever will have been too much for him?”  Greatly too much for him.  “Hah! Many suffer with it. Lucie. His daughter. French. Which is she?”  This is she.  “Apparently it must be. Lucie, the wife of Evrémonde; is it not?”  It is.  “Hah! Evrémonde has an assignation elsewhere. Lucie, her child. English. This is she?”  She and no other.  “Kiss me, child of Evrémonde. Now, thou hast kissed a good Republican; something new in thy family; remember it! Sydney Carton. Advocate. English. Which is he?”  He lies here, in this corner of the carriage. He, too, is pointed out.  “Apparently the English advocate is in a swoon?”  It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air. It is represented that he is not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is under the displeasure of the Republic.  “Is that all? It is not a great deal, that! Many are under the displeasure of the Republic, and must look out at the little window. Jarvis Lorry. Banker. English. Which is he?”  “I am he. Necessarily, being the last.”  It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions. It is Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach door, replying to a group of officials. They leisurely walk round the  carriage and leisurely mount the box, to look at what little luggage it carries on the roof; the country-people hanging about, press nearer to the coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child, carried by its mother, has its short arm held out for it, that it may touch the wife of an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine.  “Behold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned.”  “One can depart, citizen?”  “One can depart. Forward, my postilions! A good journey!”  “I salute you, citizens.—And the first danger passed!”  These are again the words of Jarvis Lorry, as he clasps his hands, and looks upward. There is terror in the carriage, there is weeping, there is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller.  “Are we not going too slowly? Can they not be induced to go faster?” asks Lucie, clinging to the old man.  “It would seem like flight, my darling. I must not urge them too much; it would rouse suspicion.”  “Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued!”  “The road is clear, my dearest. So far, we are not pursued.”  Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless trees. The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud is on either side. Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid the stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes we stick in ruts and sloughs there. The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running—hiding—doing anything but stopping.  Out of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary farms, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, cottages in twos and threes, avenues of leafless trees. Have these men deceived us, and taken us back by another road? Is not this the same place twice over? Thank Heaven, no. A village. Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued! Hush! the posting-house.  Leisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands in the little street, bereft of horses, and with no likelihood upon it of ever moving again; leisurely, the new horses come into visible existence, one by one; leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and plaiting the lashes of their whips; leisurely, the old postilions count their money, make wrong additions, and arrive at dissatisfied results.  All the time, our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled.  At length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are left behind. We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and on the low watery grounds. Suddenly, the postilions exchange speech with animated gesticulation, and the horses are pulled up, almost on their haunches. We are pursued?  “Ho! Within the carriage there. Speak then!”  “What is it?” asks Mr. Lorry, looking out at window.  “How many did they say?”  “I do not understand you.”  “—At the last post. How many to the Guillotine to-day?”  “Fifty-two.”  “I said so! A brave number! My fellow-citizen here would have it forty-two; ten more heads are worth having. The Guillotine goes handsomely. I love it. Hi forward. Whoop!”  The night comes on dark. He moves more; he is beginning to revive, and to speak intelligibly; he thinks they are still together; he asks him, by his name, what he has in his hand. O pity us, kind Heaven, and help us! Look out, look out, and see if we are pursued.  The wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are flying after us, and the moon is plunging after us, and the whole wild night is in pursuit of us; but, so far we are pursued by nothing else. \n\n CHAPTER 14  The Knitting Done  I n that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate, Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury. Not in the wine-shop did Madame Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer, erst a mender of roads. The sawyer himself did not participate in the conference, but abided at a little  distance, like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited.  “But our Defarge,” said Jacques Three, “is undoubtedly a good Republican? Eh?”  “There is no better,” the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill notes, “in France.”  “Peace, little Vengeance,” said Madame Defarge, laying her hand with a slight frown on her lieutenant’s lips, “hear me speak. My husband, fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence. But my husband has his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor.”  “It is a great pity,” croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his head, with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; “it is not quite like a good citizen; it is a thing to regret.”  “See you,” said madame, “I care nothing for this Doctor, I. He may wear his head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to me. But, the Evrémonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and child must follow the husband and father.”  “She has a fine head for it,” croaked Jacques Three. “I have seen blue eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held them up.” Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.  Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.  “The child also,” observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment of his words, “has golden hair and blue eyes. And we seldom have a child there. It is a pretty sight!”  “In a word,” said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction, “I cannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do I feel, since last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects; but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning, and then they might escape.”  “That must never be,” croaked Jacques Three; “no one must escape. We have not half enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day.”  “In a word,” Madame Defarge went on, “my husband has not my reason for pursuing this family annihilation, and I have not his reason for regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself, therefore. Come hither, little citizen.”  The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap.  “Touching those signals, little citizen,” said Madame Defarge, sternly, “that she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness to them this very day?”  “Ay, ay, why not!” cried the sawyer. “Every day, in all weathers, from two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes without. I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes.”  He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never seen.  “Clearly plots,” said Jacques Three. “Transparently!”  “There is no doubt of the Jury?” inquired Madame Defarge, letting her eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.  “Rely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. I answer for my fellow-Jurymen.”  “Now, let me see,” said Madame Defarge, pondering again. “Yet once more! Can I spare this Doctor to my husband? I have no feeling either way. Can I spare him?”  “He would count as one head,” observed Jacques Three, in a low voice. “We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.”  “He was signalling with her when I saw her,” argued Madame Defarge; “I cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent, and trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here. For, I am not a bad witness.”  The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of witnesses. The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a celestial witness.  “He must take his chance,” said Madame Defarge. “No, I cannot spare him! You are engaged at three o’clock; you are going to see the batch of to-day executed.—You?”  The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national barber. He was so very demonstrative herein, that he  might have been suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at him out of Madame Defarge’s head) of having his small individual fears for his own personal safety, every hour in the day.  “I,” said madame, “am equally engaged at the same place. After it is over—say at eight to-night—come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we will give information against these people at my Section.”  The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the citizeness. The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed, evaded her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his wood, and hid his confusion over the handle of his saw.  Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus:  “She will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death. She will be mourning and grieving. She will be in a state of mind to impeach the justice of the Republic. She will be full of sympathy with its enemies. I will go to her.”  “What an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!” exclaimed Jacques Three, rapturously. “Ah, my cherished!” cried The Vengeance; and embraced her.  “Take you my knitting,” said Madame Defarge, placing it in her lieutenant’s hands, “and have it ready for me in my usual seat. Keep me my usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a greater concourse than usual, to-day.”  “I willingly obey the orders of my Chief,” said The Vengeance with alacrity, and kissing her cheek. “You will not be late?”  “I shall be there before the commencement.”  “And before the tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul,” said The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into the street, “before the tumbrils arrive!”  Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the mud, and round the corner of the prison wall. The Vengeance and the Juryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly appreciative of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments.  There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid  a dreadfully disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets. Of a strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have heaved her up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class, opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely without pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of her.  It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her, that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she had been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who sent her there.  Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her bosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened dagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.  Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night, the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry’s attention. It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach, but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their escape might depend on the saving of only a few  seconds here and there. Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at three o’clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period. Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and, passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.  Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge, taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.  “Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose agitation was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live: “what do you think of our not starting from this court-yard? Another carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken suspicion.”  “My opinion, miss,” returned Mr. Cruncher, “is as you’re right. Likewise wot I’ll stand by you, right or wrong.”  “I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,” said Miss Pross, wildly crying, “that I am incapable of forming any plan. Are you capable of forming any plan, my dear poor Mr. Cruncher?”  “Respectin’ a future spear o’ life, miss,” returned Mr. Cruncher, “I hope so. Respectin’ any present use o’ this here blessed old head o’ mine, I think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o’ two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis?”  “Oh, for gracious sake!” cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, “record them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man.”  “First,” said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with an ashy and solemn visage, “them poor things well out o’ this, never no more will I do it, never no more!”  “I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,” returned Miss Pross, “that you  never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it necessary to mention more particularly what it is.”  “No, miss,” returned Jerry, “it shall not be named to you. Second: them poor things well out o’ this, and never no more will I interfere with Mrs. Cruncher’s flopping, never no more!”  “Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,” said Miss Pross, striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, “I have no doubt it is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own superintendence. O my poor darlings!”  “I go so far as to say, miss, morehover,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit—“and let my words be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself—that wot my opinions respectin’ flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present time.”  “There, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man,” cried the distracted Miss Pross, “and I hope she finds it answering her expectations.”  “Forbid it,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity, additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out, “as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn’t all flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get ’em out o’ this here dismal risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for—BID it!” This was Mr. Cruncher’s conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.  And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer and nearer.  “If we ever get back to our native land,” said Miss Pross, “you may rely upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time. Now, pray let us think! My esteemed Mr. Cruncher, let us think!”  Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer and nearer.  “If you were to go before,” said Miss Pross, “and stop the vehicle  and horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn’t that be best?”  Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.  “Where could you wait for me?” asked Miss Pross.  Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame Defarge was drawing very near indeed.  “By the cathedral door,” said Miss Pross. “Would it be much out of the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two towers?”  “No, miss,” answered Mr. Cruncher.  “Then, like the best of men,” said Miss Pross, “go to the posting-house straight, and make that change.”  “I am doubtful,” said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head, “about leaving of you, you see. We don’t know what may happen.”  “Heaven knows we don’t,” returned Miss Pross, “but have no fear for me. Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o’clock, or as near it as you can, and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think—not of me, but of the lives that may depend on both of us!”  This exordium, and Miss Pross’s two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself to follow as she had proposed.  The having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets, was another relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty minutes past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.  Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes, which were swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her. In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried out, for she saw a figure standing in the room.  The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much stained blood, those feet had come to meet that water.  Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, “The wife of Evrémonde; where is she?”  It flashed upon Miss Pross’s mind that the doors were all standing open, and would suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There were four in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself before the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied.  Madame Defarge’s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement, and rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing beautiful about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness, of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch.  “You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,” said Miss Pross, in her breathing. “Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of me. I am an Englishwoman.”  Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of Miss Pross’s own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a tight, hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that Miss Pross was the family’s devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well that Madame Defarge was the family’s malevolent enemy.  “On my way yonder,” said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot, “where they reserve my chair and my knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing. I wish to see her.”  “I know that your intentions are evil,” said Miss Pross, “and you may depend upon it, I’ll hold my own against them.”  Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other’s words; both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what the unintelligible words meant.  “It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment,” said Madame Defarge. “Good patriots will know what that means. Let me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?”  “If those eyes of yours were bed-winches,” returned Miss Pross, “and I was an English four-poster, they shouldn’t loose a splinter of me. No, you wicked foreign woman; I am your match.”  Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set at naught.  “Woman imbecile and pig-like!” said Madame Defarge, frowning. “I take no answer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I demand to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!” This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.  “I little thought,” said Miss Pross, “that I should ever want to understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have, except the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any part of it.”  Neither of them for a single moment released the other’s eyes. Madame Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross first became aware of her; but she now advanced one step.  “I am a Briton,” said Miss Pross, “I am desperate. I don’t care an English Twopence for myself. I know that the longer I keep you here, the greater hope there is for my Ladybird. I’ll not leave a handful of that dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!”  Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath. Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life.  But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the irrepressible tears into her eyes. This was a courage that Madame Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. “Ha, ha!” she laughed, “you poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that Doctor.” Then she raised her voice and called out, “Citizen Doctor! Wife of Evrémonde! Child of Evrémonde! Any person but this miserable fool, answer the Citizeness Defarge!”  Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of Miss Pross’s face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone. Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.  “Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind you! Let me look.”  “Never!” said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer.  “If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and brought back,” said Madame Defarge to herself.  “As long as you don’t know whether they are in that room or not, you are uncertain what to do,” said Miss Pross to her self; “and you shall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.”  “I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me, I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,” said Madame Defarge.  “We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary court-yard, we are not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here, while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to my darling,” said Miss Pross.  Madame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of the moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight. It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and strike; Miss Pross, with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate, clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.  Soon, Madame Defarge’s hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled waist. “It is under my arm,” said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, “you shall not draw it. I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I’ll hold you till one or other of us faints or dies!”  Madame Defarge’s hands were at her bosom. Miss Pross looked up, saw what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood alone—blinded with smoke.  All this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground.  In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the  body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for fruitless help. Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did, in time to check herself and go back. It was dreadful to go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to get the bonnet and other things that she must wear. These she put on, out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking away the key. She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to cry, and then got up and hurried away.  By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have gone along the streets without being stopped. By good fortune, too, she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any other woman. She needed both advantages, for the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn, and her dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and dragged a hundred ways.  In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. Arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting there, she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and charged with murder! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the escort appeared, took her in, and took her away.  “Is there any noise in the streets?” she asked him.  “The usual noises,” Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the question and by her aspect.  “I don’t hear you,” said Miss Pross. “What do you say?”  It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could not hear him. “So I’ll nod my head,” thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, “at all events she’ll see that.” And she did.  “Is there any noise in the streets now?” asked Miss Pross again, presently.  Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head.  “I don’t hear it.”  “Gone deaf in a hour?” said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind much disturbed; “wot’s come to her?”  “I feel,” said Miss Pross, “as if there had been a flash and a crash, and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.”  “Blest if she ain’t in a queer condition!” said Mr. Cruncher, more  and more disturbed. “Wot can she have been a takin’, to keep her courage up? Hark! There’s the roll of them dreadful carts! You can hear that, miss?”  “I can hear,” said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, “nothing. O, my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness, and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts.”  “If she don’t hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their journey’s end,” said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, “it’s my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.”  And indeed she never did. \n\n CHAPTER 15  The Footsteps Die Out for Ever  A long the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh. Six tumbrils carry the day’s wine to La Guillotine. All the devouring and insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself, are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine. And yet there is not in France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf, a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror. Crush humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed of rapacious licence and oppression over again, and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind.  Six tumbrils roll along the streets. Change these back again to what they were, thou powerful enchanter,Time, and they shall be seen to be the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father’s house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants! No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order of the Creator, never reverses his transformations. “If thou be  changed into this shape by the will of God,” say the seers to the enchanted, in the wise Arabian stories, “then remain so! But, if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!” Changeless and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.  As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets. Ridges of faces are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward. So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils. Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight; then he points his finger, with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.  Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with a lingering interest in the ways of life and men. Some, seated with drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as they have seen in theatres, and in pictures. Several close their eyes, and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together. Only one, and he a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made drunk by horror, that he sings, and tries to dance. Not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture, to the pity of the people.  There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils, and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some question. It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. The horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with their swords. The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand. He has no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the girl. Here and there in the long street of St. Honoré, cries are raised against him. If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face. He cannot easily touch his face, his arms being bound.  On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands the Spy and prison-sheep. He looks into the first of them: not there. He looks into the second: not there. He already asks himself, “Has he sacrificed me?” when his face clears, as he looks into the third.  “Which is Evrémonde?” says a man behind him.  “That. At the back there.”  “With his hand in the girl’s?”  “Yes.”  The man cries, “Down, Evrémonde! To the Guillotine all aristocrats! Down, Evrémonde!”  “Hush, hush!” the Spy entreats him, timidly.  “And why not, citizen?”  “He is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more. Let him be at peace.”  But the man continuing to exclaim, “Down, Evrémonde!” the face of Evrémonde is for a moment turned towards him. Evrémonde then sees the Spy, and looks attentively at him, and goes his way.  The clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed among the populace is turning round, to come on into the place of execution, and end. The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now crumble in and close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are following to the Guillotine. In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting. On one of the foremost chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for her friend.  “Thérèse!” she cries, in her shrill tones. “Who has seen her? Thérèse Defarge!”  “She never missed before,” says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood.  “No; nor will she miss now,” cries The Vengeance, petulantly. “Thérèse!”  “Louder,” the woman recommends.  Ay! Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear thee. Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet it will hardly bring her. Send other women up and down to seek her, lingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have  done dread deeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far enough to find her!  “Bad Fortune!” cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair, “and here are the tumbrils! And Evrémonde will be despatched in a wink, and she not here! See her knitting in my hand, and her empty chair ready for her. I cry with vexation and disappointment!”  As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils begin to discharge their loads. The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are robed and ready. Crash!—A head is held up, and the knitting-women who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could think and speak, count One.  The second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up. Crash!—And the knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their work, count Two.  The supposed Evrémonde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out next after him. He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out, but still holds it as he promised. He gently places her with her back to the crash engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she looks into his face and thanks him.  “But for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am naturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been able to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death, that we might have hope and comfort here to-day. I think you were sent to me by Heaven.”  “Or you to me,” says Sydney Carton. “Keep your eyes upon me, dear child, and mind no other object.”  “I mind nothing while I hold your hand. I shall mind nothing when I let it go, if they are rapid.”  “They will be rapid. Fear not!”  The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak as if they were alone. Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart to heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart and differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home together, and to rest in her bosom.  “Brave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last question? I am very ignorant, and it troubles me—just a little.”  “Tell me what it is.”  “I have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself,  whom I love very dearly. She is five years younger than I, and she lives in a farmer’s house in the south country. Poverty parted us, and she knows nothing of my fate—for I cannot write—and if I could, how should I tell her! It is better as it is.”  “Yes, yes; better as it is.”  “What I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still thinking now, as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so much support, is this:—If the Republic really does good to the poor, and they come to be less hungry, and in all ways to suffer less, she may live a long time: she may even live to be old.”  “What then, my gentle sister?”  “Do you think:” the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much endurance, fill with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble: “that it will seem long to me, while I wait for her in the better land where I trust both you and I will be mercifully sheltered?”  “It cannot be, my child; there is no Time there, and no trouble there.”  “You comfort me so much! I am so ignorant. Am I to kiss you now? Is the moment come?”  “Yes.”  She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other. The spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face. She goes next before him—is gone; the knitting-women count Twenty-Two.  “I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.”  The murmuring of many voices, the upturning of many faces, the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd, so that it swells forward in a mass, like one great heave of water, all flashes away. Twenty-Three. \n![030](bano_9781411433236_oeb_030_r1.jpg)\n They said of him, about the city that night, that it was the peace-fullest man’s face ever beheld there. Many added that he looked sublime and prophetic.  One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe—a woman—had asked at the foot of the same scaffold, not long before, to be allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her. If  he had given an utterance to his, and they were prophetic, they would have been these:  “I see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance, the Juryman, the Judge, long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease out of its present use. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in their triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.  “I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy, in that England which I shall see no more. I see Her with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name. I see her father, aged and bent, but otherwise restored, and faithful to all men in his healing office, and at peace. I see the good old man, so long their friend, in ten years’ time enriching them with all he has, and passing tranquilly to his reward.  “I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. I see her, an old woman, weeping for me on the anniversary of this day. I see her and her husband, their course done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other’s soul, than I was in the souls of both.  “I see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name, a man winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine. I see him winning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by the light of his. I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away. I see him, foremost of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my name, with a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this place—then fair to look upon, with not a trace of this day’s disfigurement—and I hear him tell the child my story, with a tender and faltering voice.  “It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.” \n\n ENDNOTES  \n\n# Book the First: Recalled to Life\n \n\n## Chapter 1: The Period\n 1 (p. 7) There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France: The kings and queens referred to are George III (1738-1820) and Queen Charlotte Sophia (1744-1818) of England, and Louis XVI (1754-1793) of France and his consort Marie-Antoinette (1755-1793), who was famous for her beauty. Dickens would have known of the English king’s “large jaw” from imprints on coins of his childhood; he would have seen Marie-Antoinette’s waxwork likeness at Madame Tus saud’s exhibition in London. 2 (p. 7) Mrs. Southcott . . . , of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster: Joanna Southcott (1750-1814) was a farmer’s daughter who converted to Methodism in 1791 at the prompting of a divine vision. She attracted a cult following when she published a volume of “prophecies” in 1801, in which she foretold of an imminent apocalypse. Southcott’s career in millennial predictions was anticipated by a celebrated nameless member of the British Army regiment the Life Guards, who, in 1750, heralded the destruction of London and Westminster. Dickens would have known of both popular celebrities from his youth. 3 (p. 7) Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs: In 1762 rumors flew about London of the ghost of a murdered woman that was terrorizing a house on Cock Lane in West Smithfield. After investigations by the eminent scholar Dr. Samuel Johnson, among others, the ghost was found to be a hoax, and the owner of the house was sent to the pillory. The craze for supernatural communications reached new heights in the 1850s, when the practice of séances was imported from America. 4 (p. 7) Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America: The First Continental Congress was held by American colonists in September and October 1774; it led to the writing of the Declaration of Independence, a document that set the stage for the American Revolution and Britain’s greatest military defeat since the Roman Conquest. 5 (p. 7) France . . . rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it: In the process of financing the arms race with their military rival Britain, French Kings Louis XV and Louis XVI built up an enormous national debt; the resultant inflation, credit crisis, and food shortages laid the groundwork for the French Revolution. 6 (pp. 7-8) sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled . . . to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards: Dickens refers to an incident of 1766 recorded by the French writer Voltaire (1694-1778) as an example of religious oppression under the ancien régime (the political and social system of France before the Revolution). In reality, the punishment Dickens describes was commuted to decapitation; this is not the only occasion where he embellishes the excesses of the French state to make his argument for the inevitability of the Revolution. 7 (pp. 7-8) rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, . . . already marked by the woodman, Fate, . . . rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire . . . which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution: The “trees” will be used in the construction of the guillotine, invented in 1785 as a humane means of enforcing capital punishment. The “rude carts” will later serve as vehicles (called tumbrils) to transport the condemned, including Sydney Carton, to the guillotine. 8 (p. 8) In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting: Dickens’s library contained the British Annual Register for 1775, his source for the criminal episodes he refers to. His Victorian readers would have been struck, as we are, by the image of a lawless and violent city very different from the “modern” London of the mid-nineteenth century. \n\n## Chapter 2: The Mail\n 1 (p. 9) Shooter’s Hill: Located on the Dover Road, Shooter’s Hill was 8 miles southeast of London. As the name suggests, its steep incline and thick, surrounding woods provided the perfect conditions for a highwayman’s ambush. 2 (p. 9) Blackheath: Another lonely spot on the Dover Road, Blackheath was notorious for robberies that occurred there. 3 (p. 14) Tellson’s Bank: Dickens’s model for Tellson’s Bank was Child & Co., a venerable banking house dating from the seventeenth century. Their offices were located in the heart of the financial district, at 1 Fleet Street. 4 (p. 16) Temple Bar: A stone gate marking the entrance to the City of London, Temple Bar was built in the seventeenth century by Sir Christopher Wren; it stood between Fleet Street and the Strand until 1878. A  later reference (see p. 56) recalls the eighteenth-century practice of placing severed heads on spikes on the gate. \n\n## Chapter 3: The Night Shadows\n 1 (p. 18) though the bank was almost always with him: Dickens is recalling a short poem by the English poet William Wordsworth (1770-1850) from “Miscellaneous Sonnets”: “The world is too much with us; late and soon, / Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers.” \n\n## Chapter 4: The Preparation\n 1 (p. 20) the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel: The “head drawer” is the chief bartender. Dickens based the Royal George on a Dover hotel called the Ship, where he occasionally stayed prior to traveling across the English Channel to France. 2 (p. 26) Beauvais: Beauvais lies on the road from Paris to Boulogne. Before the introduction of the railway, the town was well known to nineteenth-century tourists as a hospitable resting place, as well as for its thirteenth-century cathedral. 3 (p. 27) the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time:The French Revolution (1837), by Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle, is Dickens’s source for the so-called lettres de cachet , warrants of arrest that were routinely available to well-connected no blemen in the eighteenth century for the purpose of imprisoning enemies for an indefinite period without trial. While Dickens may have been critical of the British justice system, its guarantee of habeas corpus (giving citizens the right to a trial) compares starkly to the sinister power of the lettres de cachet . 4 (p. 30) a great Stilton cheese: Stilton is a famous English blue cheese that, in its wholesale quantity, has a cylindrical, drum-like shape. \n\n## Chapter 5: The Wine-shop\n 1 (p. 31) wine-shop: Wine-shops were popular social gathering places in the poorer districts of eighteenth-century Paris, and thus were natural centers of political ferment. Dickens seems to have based his character Monsieur Defarge on Claude Cholat, mentioned in Thomas Carlyle’s The French Revolution (1837), who was one of more than twenty wine-shop proprietors to participate in the storming of the Bastille. 2 (p. 32) the narrow street in the suburb of Saint Antoine: A poor and crowded manufacturing district in what is now the eighth arrondissement of Paris, Saint-Antoine was a hotbed of the Revolution and conveniently  located near the Bastille. The district maintained its radical reputation through Dickens’s time and into the 1850s and 1860s, when Paris’s director of public works, Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann, oversaw the construction of wide boulevards, which thinned the population and disabled the revolutionary practice of erecting barricades. 3 (p. 33) fabulous mill which ground old people young: A popular folk-legend of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries told of a magical mill capable of reversing the advance of age. 4 (p. 33) and upon them . . . was the sign, Hunger: Here and elsewhere Dickens relies on an allegorical figure to stand in for a detailed examination of economic conditions in France in the years leading up to the Revolution. Britons traveling in France habitually remarked on how much poorer the French population seemed compared to back home; the reasons for the poor French economy lay in a complex of factors: poor distribution mechanisms, a laissez-faire economic policy, overinvestment in the army and navy, and a series of disastrous harvests that culminated in near-famine conditions in 1789. 5 (p. 34) hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their condition: As Dickens here intimates, the ropes used to suspend street lanterns in Paris were put to deadly use by the revolutionaries. The first victim, the state counselor Foulon, was strung up in such a fashion on July 22, 1789 (see note 3 for chapter 22, the second book). 6 (p. 35) Her knitting was before her: One of the most enduring popular images of the French Revolution is that of the tricoteuses , the knitting-women who sat each day of the Reign of Terror at the foot of the guillotine, counting the heads that rolled. The Reign of Terror is a term applied to a period of the French Revolution, from 1793 to 1794, when organized violence became the principal political tool of the revolutionary leadership; thousands of people, aristocrats and patriots alike, were arrested, summarily tried, and executed. 7 (p. 36) “How goes it, Jacques?”: Jacques is a nickname for a French peasant; its collective noun, Jacquerie , is associated with the peasant uprising in 1358, which occurred near Beauvais; this no doubt prompted Dickens to choose Beauvais as Dr. Manette’s birthplace, where Defarge was presumably in service to him. 8 (p. 41) a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes: While touring the Philadelphia State Prison in 1842, Dickens met a shoemaker in solitary confinement (see the Introduction, pp. xxiii-xxiv). Shoemaking also had close historical associations with the French Revolution: in the popular newspaper character Jacques Cor donnier (“Jack the Shoemaker”) as well as in novels of the Revolution by Alexandre Dumas the elder, including Le Chevalier de Maison-Rouge (1846), in which a shoemaker-turned-gaoler named Simon torments his royal prisoners and forces the Dauphin to make shoes. \n\n## Chapter 6: The Shoemaker\n 1 (p. 45) “One Hundred and Five, North Tower”: Dickens derives most of his description of the Bastille from Thomas Carlyle’s The French Revolution (1837); but the North Tower is based on a more obscure source, Albert Smith’s novel The Marchioness of Brinvilliers (1846), in which it is also called, ironically, Liberty Tower. 2 (p. 52) “To the Barrier!”: The Barriers stood at the northern outskirts of Paris, at the towns of Saint-Denis and La Villette; they served as sites for collection of taxes on goods imported from the coastal ports to the north. \n\n# Book the Second: The Golden Thread\n \n\n## Chapter 1: Five Years Later\n 1 (p. 55) Noakes and Co.’s: “Noakes” was the generic name used in England for parties to a case in pro forma legal documents. 2 (p. 56) evil communications corrupted its good polish: Dickens is recalling a passage in the Bible, 1 Corinthians 15:33: “Evil communications corrupt good manners” (King James Version). 3 (p. 56) a Barmecide room, that always had a great dining-table in it and never had a dinner: Dickens read The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments as a child, and references to it are everywhere in his fiction. Here he alludes to the Barber’s tale of his sixth brother, in which the Barmecide, the head of the wealthy Barmaki household, invites a beggar to an imaginary feast. 4 (p. 56) in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty, . . . by the heads exposed on Temple Bar: Dickens is guilty of an anachronism here, since the last heads exposed on Temple Bar were those of two Jacobite rebels, Townley and Fletcher, in 1746. While heads sometimes remained suspended on their spikes for decades, the last reportedly blew down in a storm in 1772, eight years before the date of Dickens’s description (see also note 4 of chapter 2, the first book). 5 (p. 56) insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of Abyssinia or Ashantee: The ferocity of the African kingdoms of Abyssinia (more commonly known today as Ethiopia) and Ashanti (now part of Ghana) was better known in Dickens’s lifetime than in the eighteenth century. Britain never controlled Abyssinia, but its consul was murdered there in 1860. The Ashanti tribe engaged in bloody conflicts with the Fanti tribe and the British army, and it may be the killing of the British governor Sir Charles McCarthy  that Dickens is thinking of here; the governor’s skull served as a drinking cup in the Ashanti court. 6 (p. 57) the youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the easterly parish church of Houndsditch: The reference is to the baptismal service in the Book of Common Prayer (used in the Church of England since the sixteenth century), in which the godparents of the infant are called upon to “renounce the devil and all his works” in the infant’s name. Houndsditch was a poor quarter of London between Aldgate and Bish opsgate, named for its insalubrious medieval reputation as a repository for dead dogs; in the eighteenth century it was known as a Jewish district. 7 (p. 57) Mr. Cruncher’s private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley, Whitefriars: Jerry Cruncher lives just off Fleet Street in central London, very near to Tellson’s Bank. Whitefriars takes its name from the Carmelite order that dwelled there before the Reformation. \n\n## Chapter 2: A Sight\n 1 (p. 61) the Old Bailey: The Old Bailey still serves, in name at least, as London’s central criminal court; Dickens knew the building well from his days as a court reporter in the 1830s. The original building was damaged during the Gordon Riots of 1780 (the subject of Dickens’s 1841 novel Barnaby Rudge ), and Dickens’s Old Bailey was built in 1809. This structure, together with Newgate Prison, was destroyed and rebuilt in the first decade of the twentieth century. 2 (p. 62) “That’s quartering. . . . Barbarous!”: This punishment for treason, which dates from the thirteenth century, involved hanging the prisoner and cutting him down while still alive, then removing his bowels and burning them before his eyes, followed by decapitation, and then the slicing of the body into four quarters. Jerry Cruncher’s reaction seems to anticipate the penal reforms of the 1820s, when such punishments were abandoned (quartering was abolished in 1870) and the number of capital offenses drastically reduced. 3 (p. 62) They hanged at Tyburn: Tyburn, near what is now known as Marble Arch in Hyde Park, London, was a site of public execution until 1783, when this dubious distinction was shifted to the street outside Newgate Prison itself. Dickens himself witnessed hangings at Newgate (see the Introduction, page xiv). Tyburn enjoys literary celebrity, too, as the scene of the hero’s eleventh-hour rescue in Henry Fielding’s novel Tom Jones (1749). 4 (p. 62) the gaol was a vile place . . . where dire diseases were bred: The gaol fever, later identified as typhus, killed judges, lawyers, and the Lord Mayor in 1750. It required another deadly outbreak in 1772 before reforms were  undertaken to improve sanitary conditions, at least in the vicinity of the courtroom; these included the sprinkling of herbs and vinegar, referred to on page 65. 5 (p. 62) the pillory: The pillory (or stocks), a wooden frame with holes for locking in the head and hands, was used as a common punishment in London until 1830. The prisoner stood in stocks in the street for a specified period of time, an open target for any missiles directed at him by the public; shocking injuries could be suffered in a very short time while in the pillory, and deaths were not unknown. 6 (p. 63) the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice illustration of the precept, that “Whatever is is right”: This is a disdainful allusion to Alexander Pope’s Essay on Man (1734), which, for a Victorian social critic such as Dickens, seemed to capture the callow overoptimism of the Enlightenment in its conclusion that “One truth is clear, ‘Whatever is, is right’ ” (epistle 1, lines 293-294). 7 (p. 63) people then paid to see the play at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam: Dickens is guilty of a minor anachronism here: The public could pay a fee to watch the lunatics in their cells at Bethlehem Royal Hospital (contracted to “Bedlam” in vernacular speech) until 1770. 8 (p. 65) revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation to send to Canada and North America: The Revolutionary War in America concluded with the Treaty of Paris, signed on September 3, 1783. 9 (p. 66) as the ocean is one day to give up its dead: This is a reference to the Bible, Revelation 20:13: “And the sea gave up the dead which were in it” (KJV). \n\n## Chapter 3: A Disappointment\n 1 (p. 67) a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach: Pierre Terrail (c.1473-1524), the seigneur de Bayard, served as a captain in the French army’s Italian campaigns of the early fifteenth century. Dickens here adapts his heroic epithet, le chevalier sans peur et sans reproche (the knight without fear or reproach). 2 (p. 67) most honourable Privy Council: The Privy Council was a council of close advisers appointed by the British monarch; it later became the name for the highest court of appeal. 3 (p. 68) Virtue, as had been observed by the poets . . . was in a manner contagious; more especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country: Patriotism was a favorite theme of eighteenth-century poets such as James Thomson and William Cowper, although Dr. Johnson supposedly called patriotism “the last refuge of a scoundrel” (see James Boswell’s Life of Samuel Johnson, 1791). 4 (p. 75) that garrison-and-dockyard town: Dickens is referring to Chatham, where he spent his early boyhood, and for which he always retained a fond fascination. His father was employed as a clerk at the naval dockyard there from 1817 to 1822. 5 (p. 76) some family affairs in France, . . . though what those affairs were, a consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbad him, even for his life, to disclose: Here is one of a number of ambiguities in the plot with regard to Charles Darnay; Dickens never explains why his family affairs must be kept secret from the court, even on pain of death. 6 (pp. 76-77) that vile and infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the State Trials of this country were full: The radical journalist William Cobbett produced a multivolume collection of reports of state trials in Great Britain ( Cobbett’s Complete Collection of State Trials , 1809-1826), an edition of which Dickens owned.These published reports, which detailed evidence brought against individuals charged with crimes against the state, are more proof of the relative openness of the British justice system compared to that of the French. \n\n## Chapter 4: Congratulatory\n 1 (p. 88) a long winding-sheet in the candle: The image evokes the curl of melted wax around the stem of a tallow candle, a folkloric omen of death. Foreshadowing of Sydney Carton’s fate thus begins early in the novel. \n\n## Chapter 5: The Jackal\n 1 (p. 88) Court of King’s Bench: The King’s Bench, a division of the English High Court of Justice that dealt with cases of bankruptcy, became synonymous in popular usage with bankruptcy prison. Many people in the nineteenth century, including members of the respectable middle class, routinely spent time on the King’s Bench when unable to pay their debts. 2 (p. 89) Sydney Carton: Dickens originally chose “Dick” as Carton’s Christian name, which evoked the nickname given the author by many of his friends and also created a mirror-image of his own initials. Dick was also the name of a principal character in The Frozen Deep (1857), a melodrama coauthored by Dickins and Wilkie Collins, which Dickens acknowledges in the Preface; Dickens himself played the part in an amateur production. (See the Introduction, p. xxx), for a discussion of Sydney Carton’s role as author surrogate.) 3 (p. 89) between Hilary Term and Michaelmas: The legal year, beginning in January (Hilary Term) and ending on September 29 with Michaelmas, was broken only by Easter and the summer furlough, called “long vacation.” 4 (p. 89) twice pacing the pavements of King’s Bench-walk and Paper-buildings: King’s Bench Walk is a long walkway in the Inner Temple, the heart of London’s legal district; the Paper Buildings, in the northeast corner of the Inner Temple, are named for their method of construction, known as “paperwork,” which uses timber, lath, and plaster. 5 (p. 89) portrait of Jeffries: This is a strange judicial portrait to be hanging in the offices of a liberal lawyer, especially one who has just successfully defended a client against a charge of treason. George Jeffreys (1645?-1689) was notorious as the drunken hanging judge appointed by James II to conduct the so-called Bloody Assizes in the aftermath of the 1685 rebellion of the duke of Monmouth (known as the Monmouth Rebellion). Those Assizes, in which hundreds of rebels, expecting clemency, were executed after the most perfunctory of trials, remained a rallying cry for English liberals in Dickens’s time, as a historical symbol of monarchical tyranny and excess. In his A Child’s History of England (1854), Dickens draws a significant parallel between England under James II and the Reign of Terror in revolutionary Paris: “You will hear much of the horrors of the great French Revolution. Many and terrible they were, there is no doubt; but I know of nothing worse, done by the maddened people of France in that awful time, than was done by the highest judge in England, with the express approval of the King of England, in The Bloody Assize.” 6 (p. 91) old Shrewsbury School: Shrewsbury School, a highly prestigious English public school, adhered strictly to classical instruction. Dickens himself thought little of the utility of Latin and Greek, and Carton’s air of dissipated promise reflects poorly on his education. The fact that Charles Darnay teaches modern languages is a form of favorable comparison, representing him as practical and progressive, a man of the new Europe. 7 (p. 92) Student-Quarter of Paris: This district of Paris is better known as the Latin Quarter for its historical association with students, who spoke a famously sophisticated form of “pig Latin.” In the late-eighteenth century, the Latin Quarter still retained its medieval character, with small labyrinthine streets and centuries-old buildings; but by the time A Tale of Two Cities was written, Baron Haussmann (see endnote 2 for chapter 5, the first book) was transforming the left bank into the elegant Renaissance revival neighborhood we know today. \n\n## Chapter 6: Hundreds of People\n 1 (p. 93) The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not far from Soho-square: Dickens chooses Soho, a district of Westminster, London, for its historical associations with French refugees. Many French Protestants, known as Huguenots, fled to England following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes (which had protected the rights of Protestants in France) in 1685. It is from the descendants of these immigrants that Miss Pross later seeks to learn the secrets of French cuisine. 2 (p. 94) Clerkenwell: A semirural enclave of London in the late-eighteenth century, Clerkenwell was home to the famous spa and theater house Sadler’s Wells. Clerkenwell’s atmosphere of suburban serenity disappeared rapidly during the nineteenth century, however, and in Dickens’s last completed novel, Our Mutual Friend (1864-1865), set in 1859, it is portrayed as a squalid place. 3 (p. 94) There were few buildings then, north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields: Once rolling farmland, Soho was rapidly developed during the seventeenth century, and by the late-eighteenth century was a relatively well-heeled neighborhood. There were open fields, however, to the north of Soho Square and beyond the British Museum. 4 (p. 94) like stray paupers without a settlement: One of the oppressive provisions of the Poor Laws, first established in 1601, was that any poor person who moved out of his legal residence was no longer entitled to the charitable assistance of his parish. 5 (p. 95) a golden arm starting out of the wall: Golden arms were typically placed above the entrance of goldsmith’s shops. One such arm, which once belonged to a shop in the Soho district, can now be seen in the Charles Dickens Museum in London. A replica hangs above a residence in what is now Manette Street in Soho. 6 (p. 101) in search of impoverished French: Dickens is referring to the Huguenots (see note 1 for this chapter); Soho was still a haven for French emigrés in Victorian times, “a kind of Petty France” as Peter Cunningham called it in his A Handbook for London, Past and Present (1850). \n\n## Chapter 7: Monseigneur in Town\n 1 (p. 105) his morning’s chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four strong men besides the Cook: Dickens’s description of the aristocratic “Monseigneur” is borrowed from Louis-Sébastien Mercier’s Le Tableau de Paris (1781-1788). Here, as elsewhere, Dickens’s representations of the excesses of the ancien régime are based in truth, but exaggerated; Mercier says nothing of five men carrying a pot of chocolate, a fashionable beverage among the eighteenth-century nobility. 2 (p. 106) the regretted days of the merry Stuart who sold it: The reference is to Charles II, king of England, Ireland, and Scotland from 1660 to 1685, who was called “merry” for his love of art, fashion, and entertainment. The Treaty of Dover (1670), signed in secret, guaranteed Charles a pension from his cousin Louis XIV of France in exchange for declaring himself Roman Catholic and joining the war against the Dutch. 3 (p. 106) “The earth and the fulness thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur”: This allusion to the Bible, Psalm 24:1—“The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof” (KJV)—creates a pun on the French word seigneur , which can refer to lords both worldly and divine. 4 (p. 106) Farmer-General: Farmers-general were the provincial social climbers of the ancien régime, mostly wealthy but title-less landowners who purchased the right to collect taxes for the king, and used that court appointment to gain entrance to Parisian society. The farmers-general were a particular target for revolutionary rage after 1789. 5 (p. 107) Unbelieving Philosophers: Dickens is referring to Skepticism, the school of eighteenth-century French Enlightenment thought most famously represented by Voltaire (1694-1778). Thomas Carlyle detested the atheism of the movement, but Dickens more distrusts the influence of its empirical, scientific thinking on the culture at large, from the abstract idealism of the French revolutionaries that is the subject of A Tale of Two Cities , to the heartless statistical fetishism exemplified in Thomas Gradgrind in Dickens’s novel Hard Times (1854). 6 (p. 107) Unbelieving Chemists: The reference is to the eighteenth-century fascination with alchemy and the perennial search for the “philosopher’s stone,” which would transform base metals into gold. 7 (p. 108) would have found it hard to discover . . . one solitary wife, who, in her manners and appearance, owned to being a Mother. . . . Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close: Once again, Dickens is probably drawing on Mercier (see note 1, above), this time from his post-revolutionary volume Le Nouveau Paris (1799), in which Mercier discusses how a positive attitude toward motherhood and breast-feeding developed only after the Revolution. 8 (p. 108) a fantastic sect of Convulsionists: The French equivalent to various forms of dissenting religious enthusiasts in eighteenth-century Britain and America, the Convulsionists spoke in tongues, flagellated themselves and each other, and “convulsed” in a manner that attracted the attention of some members of the French social elite, who adopted its most eye-catching exponents into their circle. Marie-Antoinette was particularly susceptible to such fads, a fact that contributed to the public’s resentment toward her. 9 (p. 108) another sect, which mended matters with a jargon about “the Centre of Truth”: The reference is to another popular mystical sect whose followers believed that despite man’s natural sinfulness, God retained him at the circumferential rim of Being. From there it was his duty to progress, through reflection and “vaporous feelings,” toward the “Centre of Truth.” 10 (p. 109) Palace of the Tuileries: The Tuileries Palace was begun in 1564 by  Queen Catherine de Médicis (1519-1589) as a reminder of the Flor ence she had left behind; it was expanded by Henri IV (1553-1610), who joined it to the Louvre Palace by means of a long gallery.The palace lost its monarchical associations when Louis XIV removed his court to Versailles, but Louis XVI was forced by the French revolutionists to return in October 1789. Thereafter, the palace became a focus for revolutionary violence, not only in 1792 when the Swiss guards were slaughtered there en masse, but again in the July Revolution of 1830, and finally in 1871 when it was destroyed by the communards (supporters of the insurrectionary government known as the commune of Paris). 11 (p. 110) he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet: In the Bible, Matthew 10:14, Jesus sent forth his twelve disciples, saying, “And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet” (KJV). \n\n## Chapter 8: Monseigneur in the Country\n 1 (p. 113) A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant . . . a dejected disposition to give up, and wither away: Another contemporaneous source becomes important for these observations on the parlous state of French agriculture in the 1780s; in his well-known Travels in France during the years 1787, 1788, 1789 (1792), English agriculturist Arthur Young gave frequent descriptions of rural poverty, as well as informed indictments of agricultural techniques and policy. 2 (p. 114) whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as if he came attended by the Furies: In classical mythology, the three Furies, or Erinyes, were bloodthirsty agents of revenge, often represented with snakes in their hair. Their special retributive role in offenses of kinship (for example, their pursuit of Orestes for the crime of matricide) make them natural attendants to the Marquis, a vicious and casual destroyer of families who would imprison his own nephew if he could. 3 (p. 117) Monsieur Gabelle: Gabelle is named after the deeply resented salt tax (the gabelle ) imposed by the ancien régime; the government arrogated a monopoly on the entire salt trade, and also set a minimum level of consumption for each individual. 4 (p. 119) The sweet scents of the summer night rose . . . as the rain falls, impartially: Dickens is alluding to the Bible, Matthew 5:45: “He maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust” (KJV). \n\n## Chapter 9: The Gorgon’s Head\n 1 (p. 119) The Gorgon’s Head: The three Gorgons of classical mythology were hideous creatures whose look turned men to stone; the chief Gorgon was Medusa, whose head was topped with hissing snakes. Perseus slew Medusa with the help of two deities, Hermes and Athena, who lent him a sword and a shield, respectively; Perseus then used her petrifying head to slay a sea monster poised to devour the lovely Andromeda. Medusa was a common ornament on Renaissance and Renaissance Revival buildings, and so belongs on the château. The Gorgon’s Head is also the basis for one of the novel’s bravura passages, when the Marquis is murdered. 2 (p. 123) a letter de cachet: It is a measure of the polar difference between the corrupted aristocratic Evrémondes and the loyal and loving Manette family, representatives of the rising professional middle class, that the Marquis would be willing to consign his nephew to prison indefinitely, while Lucie Manette risks her life to retrieve her father from just such an ordeal. (For a discussion of lettres de cachet , see note 3 for chapter 4, the first book). 3 (p. 123) one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter— his daughter?: This is a reference to the notorious and somewhat mythical droit du seigneur, an aristocratic privilege granting the lord sexual rights over a vassal’s bride on her wedding night. The right certainly existed in theory, but to what extent it was ever practiced is a matter of historical dispute. Like courtly love, it may have been largely a literary phenomenon; Dickens would have had in mind the French playwright Pierre-Augustin Carron de Beaumarchais’s reliance on it in his comedy The Marriage of Figaro (1784) as a standing indictment of the old order. Certainly in the eighteenth century, there are precious few references to any episodes even remotely resembling the abuses handed out by the young Marquis to the family of Madame Defarge (revealed as a crucial plot element later in the novel). It is another case of Dickens both exaggerating and simplifying the historical record to achieve his dramatic and political ends. 4 (p. 123) a new philosophy: Charles is a follower of Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and the other Enlightenment philosophers of the eighteenth century whose political writings laid the ideological groundwork for revolutions on both sides of the Atlantic. 5 (p. 124) the château as it was to be a very few years hence, . . . could have been shown to him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked ruins: Dickens looks forward to the summer of 1789, when the aristocratic châteaux (country estates) became the principal objects of revolutionary violence outside of Paris. His language here is very close to that of the historian Thomas Carlyle: “How  is the fair gold-and-green of the ripe bright Year defaced with horrid blackness: black ashes of chateaus, black bodies of gibbeted men” (from The French Revolution ). 6 (p. 124) As for the roof he vaunted, . . . out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets: As supplies of metal for munitions quickly ran short during the Revolution, lead from the roofs of grand buildings, châteaux, and churches was melted down for bullets. 7 (p. 129) a new version of the German ballad of Leonora: The reference is to a ballad by German poet Gottfried Bürger (1747-1794); the ballad is far better known today for its illustrators, William Blake (1796) and Daniel Maclise (1847), than for its story, which tells the characteristically maudlin eighteenth-century tale of a woman whose lover is killed in the wars, only for him to return as a ghost and claim his marital rights. Leonora thus dies for love in a singularly literal manner. \n\n## Chapter 10: Two Promises\n 1 (p. 130) Mr. Charles Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French language. . . . In this age, he would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor: With its program in modern languages, the University of London, where it is implied Darnay teaches, distinguished itself from its ancient counterparts, Oxford and Cambridge, where such instruction took far longer to establish itself in the curriculum. No teachers of modern European languages appear in the eighteenth-century faculty records at Cambridge, for example. Nevertheless, the English poet William Wordsworth (1770-1850) learned Italian there at around this time. 2 (p. 130) Such masters were not at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were to be, were not yet of the Teacher class: Louis-Philippe (1773-1850), the eldest son of Louis-Philippe-Joseph, duc d’Orléans, fled France after his father’s execution in 1793. While in exile in Switzerland, he earned his living teaching mathematics. He later returned to France and ruled as the “citizen king” between the revolutions of 1830 and 1848. 3 (p. 130) no ruined nobility had dropped out of Tellson’s ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters: Aristocrats began fleeing France for England in the summer of 1789; those who were unable to transfer liquid assets to institutions such as the fictional Tellson’s Bank were often forced to take up menial trades. 4 (p. 130) he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor to lie on beds of roses: According to legend, Dick Whittington (c.1358-1423), a future lord mayor of London, believed the streets of London were paved with gold. The “beds of roses” are Christopher Marlowe’s (1564-1593), from his well-known poem “The Passionate Shepherd to His Love”: “And I will make thee beds of roses / And a thousand fragrant posies, / A cap of flowers, and a kirtle / Embroider’d all with leaves of myrtle.” 5 (p. 131) from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes: The “scarce tolerable” season of “decrepit winter” is represented by the English poet John Milton (1608-1674) in book 10 of Paradise Lost as a heaven-ordained consequence of the Fall. \n\n## Chapter 11: A Companion Picture\n 1 (pp. 137-138) before the setting in of the long vacation: The Hilary, Easter, and Trinity terms are followed by the summer furlough, called “long vacation,” which comes to an end with Michaelmas on September 29. \n\n## Chapter 12: The Fellow of Delicacy\n 1 (p. 142) Vauxhall Gardens . . . Ranelagh: The Vauxhall, laid out on the south bank of the Thames in 1661, were the most popular public pleasure gardens of Georgian London, famous for their music, masquerades, and theatrical entertainments, and immortalized in novels by Henry Fielding and Fanny Burney. The gardens were still hugely popular in Dickens’s youth, but they declined with the advent of the more circumspect Victorian era, and were finally closed in 1859, the year Dickens wrote A Tale of Two Cities. Vauxhall’s rival the Ranelagh Gardens, located east of the Chelsea Hospital, offered supper and entertainment to London’s fashionable set for a shilling’s admission; they closed in 1804. \n\n## Chapter 14: The Honest Tradesman\n 1 (p. 153) Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams, like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty watching one stream: This is most likely a reference to Charon, the ferryman of the underworld in classical mythology. Charon is described by the Roman poet Virgil (70-19 B.C.) in book 6 of the Aeneid as “a sordid god”; it requires a leap of imagination to think him “rustic,” as Dickens does here. 2 (p. 153) Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in the sight of men: A piece of Florentine folklore that caught Dickens’s imagination on his travels through Italy relates that the poet Dante (1265-1321) was accustomed to sit contemplatively on a stool outside the Duomo. Dickens also refers to this legend in his novel Little Dorrit (1855-1857). 3 (p. 157) bear-leader: Traveling showmen who earned their living by presenting a bear that performed dancing, counting, or other tricks were still readily found in mid-Victorian London. 4 (p. 157) old church of Saint Pancras: At the time of the novel, this ancient church, now within the city of London, stood in the heart of Middle-sex County on the main road leading from King’s Cross to Kentish  Town. Its isolated situation and large graveyard gave it a ghoulish reputation, which Dickens later plays upon in the scene of little Jerry Cruncher’s nighttime adventure. 5 (p. 160) disciple of Izaak Walton: The English writer Izaak Walton wrote The Compleat Angler; or, the Contemplative Man’s Recreation (1653).The image of Jerry Cruncher and his accomplices as contemplative men of leisure on a nighttime fishing jaunt is a delicious, quintessentially Dickensian irony. 6 (p. 163) Resurrection-Man: The original body snatchers, the “resurrection men” of Georgian England, earned good money by exhuming recently deceased bodies and selling them to medical schools, which were restrained from procuring cadavers for instruction in the developing field of anatomy. In 1832, as a concession to the wholesale and unstoppable trade from London’s poorer graveyards, Parliament passed the Anatomy Act, which allowed medical schools to legally acquire unclaimed bodies. At about that time, the young Dickens, on being asked to leave his name at an office, left the following: “Charles Dickens. Resurrectionist in Search of a Subject.” \n\n## Chapter 15: Knitting\n 1 (p. 169) his right hand, armed with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; . . . all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen: An unsuccessful attempt on Louis XV’s life was made in 1757 by the unfortunate Robert Damiens, who apparently hoped in killing the king to solve the sectarian disputes then facing the Church. However, he merely wounded Louis, and was sentenced to death in the manner Dickens describes. Once again, what Dickens represents as typical was in fact highly unusual. The spectacle of Damiens’s execution in this deliberately anachronistic, medieval manner won sympathy for him he would not otherwise have had, and was an important episode in the drift of public sentiment away from the monarchy. 2 (p. 172) the large-faced King and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the shining Bull’s Eye of their Court: The Salon de l’oeil de Boeuf (room of the bull’s eye) was the anteroom to the king’s apartments at Versailles, where the ritual of the monarch’s levee (a reception held when he arose from bed) unfolded daily before a crowd of courtiers and attendants. The royal family also dined there in public view. \n\n## Chapter 16: Still Knitting\n 1 (p. 185) when the military drums should be beating to drown a wretched voice: The reference is to the execution of King Louis XVI on January 21, 1793.  The monarch tried to speak to his people, but at a signal from his executioners, drums drowned out his final words. \n\n## Chapter 21: Echoing Footsteps\n 1 (p. 208) Suffer them and forbid them not: Dickens is referring here to the Bible, Matthew 19:14: “Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven” (KJV). 2 (p. 212) muskets were being distributed: This detail is borrowed from Thomas Carlyle, who describes the looting of the government arsenal at the Hotel des Invalides by the sansculottes (a radical group in France during the time of the Revolution), who then used the weapons to wage war against the state (see The French Revolution , 1837). 3 (p. 213) Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke: In The French Revolution (1837), Carlyle begins his account of the storming of the Bastille by conceding that the event “perhaps transcends the talent of mortals” to describe. By concentrating on the role of the fictional Defarges, Dickens mostly steers clear of Carlyle’s panoramic model, but he does borrow these details of the Bastille architecture. 4 (p. 216) Otherwise, the governor would not be marched to the Hôtel de Ville for judgment: The Marquis de Launay, governor of the Bastille, first negotiated with the mob on July 14, 1789, before rejecting their demands for access to the Bastille’s gunpowder stores. In the confusion, the drawbridge was lowered, and the crowd surged inside; de Launay ordered his soldiers to fire and more than a hundred of the insurgents were killed. When the revolutionaries prevailed, de Launay was marched toward the Hôtel de Ville, and killed on the way. Dickens bestows the honor of that retribution on Madame Defarge. 5 (p. 217) Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly released by the storm that had burst their tomb: The great irony in the storming of the Bastille, that great symbol of state oppression, was that only seven prisoners were liberated, none of them political prisoners except in the broadest sense; they included two madmen and an aristocratic disciple of the Marquis de Sade. \n\n## Chapter 22: The Sea Still Rises\n 1 (p. 219) the complimentary name of The Vengeance: The substitution of individual names with allegorical monikers was popular during the Revolution; for example, Louis-Philippe-Joseph, duc d’Orléans, became Philippe-Égalité (meaning “equality”). It is also a favorite device of Dickens, particularly in his later fiction. In A Tale of Two Cities , Dickens  strictly limits the individual identities of his revolutionaries, instead emphasizing their collectivity. 2 (p. 219) red cap: Based on an ancient symbol of liberty, a red cap became the headgear of choice during the Revolution. Louis XVI was forced to wear one after the assault on the Tuileries Palace in June 1792. 3 (p. 219) old Foulon: Joseph-Francois Foulon was a counselor to Louis XVI known for his remark that the people should eat grass if they were hungry. For that, as well as his long-standing reputation for manipulating food distribution to his own profit, he was one of the first victims of the mob, strung up on a lantern rope, decapitated, and his mouth stuffed with grass. 4 (p. 223) son-in-law of the despatched: In his position as a senior tax official, Bertier de Sauvigny was suspected of crimes similar to those charged to his father-in-law Foulon—specifically, of withholding needed food supplies from the people. They died together in July 1789, when the mob overwhelmed the National Guardsmen and escorted them to the Hôtel de Ville for trial. \n\n## Chapter 23: Fire Rises\n 1 (p. 225) Monseigneur began to run away: The so-called “first emigration” of French nobility to England began in July 1789. Joining them was the Comte d’Artois, younger brother of Louis XVI, who later led an organization of loyalist resistance to the Revolution. 2 (p. 225) dust he was and to dust he must return: This verse from the Bible, Genesis 3:19, is most familiar from its use in the burial service in the Book of Common Prayer. \n\n## Chapter 24: Drawn to the Loadstone Rock\n 1 (p. 231) Drawn to the Loadstone Rock: The image of the Loadstone Rock comes from “The Third Kalandar’s Tale” in The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments ; the hero, Ajib, finds his ship drawn magnetically toward a forbidding black mountain made of loadstone. 2 (p. 231) a people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger: The revolutionary government, fearing invasion from the east by a counterrevolutionary force led by the Duke of Brunswick, declared a state of national alert in July 1792. A red flag was a symbol of martial law; it was first hoisted on the Champs de Mars in July 1791 to disperse a crowd that had gathered to sign a petition to depose the King. The institution of martial law, dating from October 1789, created divisions between the revolutionary government and its foot soldiers, the sansculottes . 3 (p. 231) Monseigneur, as a class, . . . being so little wanted in France, as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it, and this life together: Prompted by fears of counterrevolution, the revolutionary government passed laws in August 1792 ordering the confiscation of all property belonging to emigrés. Later it declared that returning emigrés would be killed. 4 (p. 231) reading the Lord’s Prayer backwards: In folklore, this is an invocation of the Devil. 5 (p. 231) Sardanapalus’s luxury: Sardanapalus (seventh century B.C.) was a king of Assyria notorious for his luxurious appetites. His death—by the deliberate burning of his palace, in which he, his famous harem, and his treasure, were all destroyed—was a favorite theme of the Romantics, immortalized in a historical drama by Lord Byron, Sardanapalus (1821), and a painting by Eugène Delacroix, The Death of Sardanapalus (1827). 6 (p. 231) Royalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and “suspended”: After a period of uncertainty, and inconclusive negotiations between parties to the Revolution and the king, political events in the French Revolution accelerated rapidly in the summer of 1792. Louis XVI and his family were first besieged in the Tuilieries Palace in August and their Swiss guards massacred. The king’s veto power was subsequently revoked, and a Republic was declared on September 21. 7 (p. 232) the winter weather: This is a mistake in the manuscript. In an early draft, Darnay traveled to France in the winter, but Dickens realized his hero would have to do so with full knowledge of the prior summer’s tumultuous events, thus rendering the journey more suicidal than courageous. He therefore moved the date of Darnay’s trip to late summer. Dickens’s subsequent altering of seasonal references overlooked this passage. 8 (p. 233) who can say that Paris is not set a-fire to-day, or sacked to-morrow: The reference is to the threat posed by the Duke of Brunswick’s army in August 1792. The Duke warned he would sack Paris if harm were done to the King. 9 (p. 234) as if observers of the wretched millions in France . . . had not in plain words recorded what they saw: This is a direct acknowledgment of a key source for the novel, Travels in France during the years 1787, 1788, 1789 (1792), by the English agriculturist Arthur Young. 10 (p. 237) Prison of the Abbaye: Located near the medieval church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, the Prison de l’Abbaye contained mostly minor enemies of the Revolution, such as Gabelle; nevertheless, it was a focal target for the September massacres (September 2-7, 1792) when mobs broke into jails in Paris and killed some 2,000 imprisoned royalist sympathizers (see also note 8 for chapter 1, the third book). The Conciergerie was reserved for prisoners accused of capital crimes. \n\n# Book the Third: The Track of a Storm\n \n\n## Chapter 1: In Secret\n 1 (p. 245) In Secret: The French translation for this chapter title is En Secret , meaning “solitary confinement.” See the Introduction for a broader discussion of forms of state-sponsored secrecy in the novel. 2 (p. 245) citizen-patriots: After the abolition of titles in 1791, “citizen” ( citoyen ) became the normative mode of address in revolutionary France, a ritual affirmation of equality between the classes. 3 (p. 245) Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death: Dickens is quoting the motto adopted by the new French Republic. 4 (p. 246) The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tricoloured cockades: To replace the white cockades and ensigns associated with the Bourbon kings, the revolutionary government drew on the ancient colors of Paris—red and blue, overlaid on white—to create the famous tricolor flag. 5 (p. 247) “He is a traitor since the decree. His life is forfeit to the people. His cursed life is not his own!”: The patriot here is incorrect, or Dickens has forgotten that it was not until March 1793 that emigrés faced death if they ventured to return to France. 6 (p. 248) circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn up together singing a Liberty song: “Trees of Liberty,” treated by Louis-Sébastien Mercier in his post-revolutionary volume Nouveau Paris (1799), were popular symbols of the Revolution. The most famous, 60 feet high and topped by a red cap, stood in the Champ de Mars. The “Liberty song” is, of course, La Marseillaise , the French national anthem, which was composed during the Revolution and sung by French revolutionary forces. 7 (p. 251) prison of La Force: Once an aristocratic residence, the Prison of La Force became a prison in 1780 and was a focus of the September massacres in 1792. 8 (p. 253) horrible massacre: The notorious September massacres of 1792 consisted of summary executions of nearly 2,000 prisoners, male and female, in the four main Paris prisons. Carlyle devotes much space to this event in The French Revolution (1837), and historians consider it the single greatest atrocity of the Revolution, six days of murderous mayhem that are a chilling counterpart to the sustained, organized slaughter that took place during the Reign of Terror (1793-1794). \n\n## Chapter 2: The Grindstone\n 1 (p. 257) the Saint Germain Quarter: The medieval quarter on the left bank of the River Seine, named for its famous church, Saint-Germain was once the preferred residence of aristocrats and has long been considered the heart of intellectual and cultural life in Paris. 2 (p. 257) A mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his metempsychosis: Metempsychosis refers to the transmigration of souls speculated upon by Greek philosophers. There is also an allusion here to Ovid’s epic poem Metamorphoses (A.D. 1-8), specifically the story of Actaeon, the hunter who was transformed into a stag and torn apart by his own hounds. 3 (p. 257) would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette: The Gazette was the official public organ of the British government; it published news of military victories, but also contained lists of bankruptcies, the function alluded to here. 4 (p. 258) Lombard-street: Lombard Street in the City of London has been known since medieval times as a center of banking and finance. 5 (p. 261) False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them: Dickens somewhat comically sanitizes a shocking incident during the September massacres, in which a gang of sansculottes murdered the Princesse de Lamballe, decapitated her, then cut off her pubic hair and plastered it to their faces. Carlyle hints at but does not specify the indignity, but Mercier describes it explicitly in Nouveau Paris (1799). \n\n## Chapter 4: Calm in Storm\n 1 (p. 270) whose business was with all degrees of mankind, bond and free: This is an allusion to the Bible, 1 Corinthians 12:13: “Whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free” (KJV). 2 (p. 271) The new era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death against the world in arms: Dickens now jumps ahead in time, past the execution of Louis XVI on January 21, 1793, to the crisis of February and March 1793, when the French army, now representing the revolutionary government, lost a series of battles to advancing Austrian and Prussian armies, prompting a massive call-up of reinforcements. 3 (p. 271) three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils of France, as if the dragon’s teeth had been sown broadcast: According to the classical myth of the founding of Thebes, Cadmus killed a dragon and sowed its teeth into the earth, from which sprung an entire army. 4 (p. 271) Year One of Liberty: The French Revolutionary Calendar, decreed on October 5, 1793, was computed retrospectively: “Year One” refers to the year beginning September 22, 1792, the day after the proclamation of the Republic. 5 (p. 271) Though days and nights circled as regularly as when time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day: This is a reference to the Bible, Genesis 1:5—“And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.  And the evening and the morning were the first day” (KJV)—as well as an allusion to the revolutionaries’ ambition to restart history, dating from their declaration of a French Republic. 6 (p. 271) the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery, to turn it grey: After the execution of the king, his queen, Marie-Antoinette, remained in prison until October 16, 1793, when she was finally brought to the guillotine. 7 (p. 271) law of the Suspected: Defining as “suspect” all those deemed suspicious, the Law of Suspects inaugurated a form of paranoid totalitarian state well known in the twentieth century (see the Introduction). It was passed by the Revolutionary Convention on September 17, 1793, and resulted in the introduction of round-the-clock hearings at the Tribunal, and a tripling in both the prison population and the number of executions. 8 (p. 272) La Guillotine . . . was bowed down to and believed in where the Cross was denied: The French Revolution was deeply anticlerical in ideology, methods, and symbols. The divorce between church and state in France remains absolute. 9 (p. 272) Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes: The Girondins, the more moderate party that grew out of the Revolution, wished the king to be spared. They paid for their concern for Louis’s head with their own on October 31, 1793, when the radical Jacobins assumed full control of the state. One Girondin had committed suicide before his arrest but was beheaded anyway. 10 (p. 272) The name of the strong man of Old Scripture: “Jack Ketch” became the proverbial name for all English hangmen following the exploits of the eponymous executioner of the Bloody Assizes in 1686, but the French went one better, passing the office down through one family, called San son, for almost two hundred years. Dickens notes the similarity of San son’s name to the Old Testament biblical hero Samson, known for his prodigious strength (see Judges 13-16). 11 (p. 272) the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the violently drowned by night: The reference to the violent suppression of loyalists in Lyons is couched in the language of the Bible, Psalm 126:4: “Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south” (KJV). \n\n## Chapter 5: The Wood-sawyer\n 1 (p. 273) One year and three months: Dickens places Darnay’s arrest at the beginning of September 1792. Therefore, the action has now shifted to November 1793, during the Reign of Terror. 2 (p. 277) This was the Carmagnole: Carmagnole describes both a French revolutionary song and dance, and the outfit (short jacket, tricolor waistcoat, long trousers) of those lower-class Parisians most likely to perform it. 3 (p. 278) the Conciergerie: The main prison adjoining the Palais de Justice, the Conciergerie was where the Revolutionary Tribunal heard cases against those charged with capital offenses against the state. Its most famous inmate was Marie-Antoinette, who displayed legendary grace and sang-froid for the term of her incarceration. \n\n## Chapter 6: Triumph\n 1 (p. 279) The dread Tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor: The Revolutionary Tribunal, principal judicial organ of the Reign of Terror, was presided over by Antoine-Quentin Fouquier-Tinville. In accordance with the dark logic of the Terror, he ultimately went to the guillotine himself in May 1795. 2 (p. 283) The first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign of Death—a raised finger: The reference is probably to one of the most celebrated victims of the Terror, the French revolutionary Madame Roland, who reportedly made some gesture to the crowd after her Tribunal hearing indicating that she had been condemned to death. Once on the scaffold, she uttered the famous words, “O Liberty! What crimes are committed in thy name!” \n\n## Chapter 8: A Hand at Cards\n 1 (pp. 291-292) After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of The Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity: The French Revolution adopted the Roman Republic as its model of enlightened government, inspiring a fashion for all things Roman. But by showing that homage to antiquity in this mock-heroic form—where the fate of Lucius Junius Brutus, who helped expel the Tarquin tyrants from Rome during the sixth century B.C., is to emblazon the door of a sleazy Parisian wine-shop—Dickens exemplifies Karl Marx’s dictum that “history repeats itself first as tragedy, then as farce.” 2 (p. 292) somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion: The most famous such assassination was that of the doctor and journalist Jean-Paul Marat, murdered in his bath on July 13, 1793. The incident might have been forgotten down the generations but for Jacques-Louis David’s iconic painting The Death of Marat (1793). 3 (p. 296) Sheep of the Prisons: This was a spy placed in a cell with a prisoner in the guise of being a prisoner himself. “Sheep-biter” was the English slang equivalent (see the Introduction, p. xxiii). 4 (p. 299) Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr. Barsad, still in the  pay of the aristocratic English government, is the spy of Pitt: Rumors were rife in revolutionary France that English intelligence agents, under the orders of Prime Minister William Pitt (1759-1806), were acting as provocateurs , inciting violence and confusion so as to destabilize the new government (see the Introduction). 5 (p. 300) the reigning terror: In June 1793 Robespierre led the Jacobins against the more moderate republicans called the Girondists and took control of the National Convention. In July a Committee of Public Safety was formed, with Robespierre as its unofficial head. It was the decision of this committee to institute the repressive and violent police measures collectively known as the Reign of Terror. Its purpose was to cleanse France of counter-revolutionary elements and to institute republican virtue by force. As a record of the actual consequences of this policy, A Tale of Two Cities stands as a damning indictment of state violence used to ideological ends. The Reign of Terror persisted into 1794. 6 (p. 302) the Cow with the crumpled horn in the house that Jack built: The reference is to the well-known children’s rhyme: “This is the cow with the crumpled horn / That tossed the dog / That worried the cat / That killed the rat / That ate the malt / That lay in the house that Jack built.” \n\n## Chapter 9: The Game Made\n 1 (p. 311) “you know the consequences of mixing them?”: The use of ether, some form of which Sydney Carton appears to be planning to concoct, was better known in Victorian England than in Georgian England. Nevertheless, the drug was first discovered and developed in France, so the purchase is not implausible. 2 (p. 311) “I am the resurrection and the life . . . : whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die”: The words are from the Bible, John 11:25-26 (KJV), which serves as the opening of the burial service in the Book of Common Prayer. 3 (p. 311) and still of to-morrow’s and to-morrow’s: An allusion to Macbeth’s soliloquy (in Shakespeare’s Macbeth , act 5, scene 5), particularly appropriate to the “sound and fury” of the Revolution, and the “dusty death” it brought to so many. 4 (p. 311) in the towers of the churches, where no prayers were said: Anti-clericalism peaked at this period of the Revolution, with the enthronement of the “Goddess of Reason” at Notre-Dame at the express behest of the Convention; other churches were converted to workshops, prisons, and even taverns. 5 (p. 312) it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to Death’s dominion: Dickens is alluding to the Bible, Romans 6:9: “Knowing that Christ being raised  from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him” (KJV). 6 (p. 313) the suicidal vengeance of the Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds: This is another biblical allusion, to Ezekiel 17:21: “And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds” (KJV). \n\n## Chapter 10: The Substance of the Shadow\n 1 (p. 316) “These words are formed by . . . scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed with blood”: In Le Comte de Monte Cristo (1844-1845), by Alexandre Dumas the elder, the prisoner Abbé Faria uses soot and blood, in addition to wine, to write surprisingly lengthy communications. 2 (p. 316) Street of the School of Medicine: This street was home also to Jean-Paul Marat, stabbed to death in his bath at number 44 (see note 2 for chapter 8, above). 3 (p. 322) They have had their shameful rights, these Nobles, in the modesty and virtue of our sisters: Dickens is referring to the notorious droit de seigneur (see note 3 for chapter 9, the second book). 4 (p. 323) pillaged and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat, we ate it in fear: The scene is borrowed from Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Confessions (1781, 1788). That French peasants were forced to conceal what food they did have, and thus “ate it in fear” of excise or even worse punishment, is a powerful indictment of the old French system, and suggests the total penetration of the domestic realm by the monitoring eye of the state (see the Introduction). 5 (p. 330) sacrifices and self-immolations on the people’s altar: The Revolution very quickly took on the character of a cult, and adopted the trappings of religion. The first revolutionary altar was erected in the ruins of the Bastille, and was festooned with chains and manacles borrowed from its cells. 6 (p. 331) Death within four-and-twenty hours!: This was the standard capital sentence handed down by the Revolutionary Tribunal. \n\n## Chapter 11: Dusk\n 1 (p. 331) “We shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!”: The reference is to the Bible, Job 3:17: “There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest” (KJV). \n\n## Chapter 12: Darkness\n 1 (p. 337) as he took up a Jacobin journal: With their defeat of the Girondins, who had favored sparing the King, the Jacobins were now the ruling  political entity in France, dominating every branch of government and the press. \n\n## Chapter 13: Fifty-two\n 1 (p. 344) farmer-general: The farmers-general (see note 4 for chapter 7, the second book) included many liberal men sympathetic to the Revolution and some outstanding individuals, most notably the chemist Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier (1743-1794). All were sent, indiscriminately, to the guillotine. 2 (p. 345) He wrote a long letter to Lucie: A letter of farewell was one of the few privileges granted to prisoners at the Conciergerie. Many of these letters survived and have been published. \n\n## Chapter 14: The Knitting Done\n 1 (p. 356) But my husband has his weaknesses: An echo of Lady Macbeth, who worried that her husband’s nature was “too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness” (act 1, scene 5). \n\n## Chapter 15: The Footsteps Die Out for Ever\n 1 (p. 367) Six tumbrils carry the day’s wine to La Guillotine: The tumbrils began their journey at the Conciergerie, situated on the Ile de la Cité. They crossed north over either the Pont Neuf or Pont au Change, then headed west along the Rue Saint Honoré to the Place de la Révolution, where the guillotine awaited them. After the Terror subsided, the site was renamed Place de la Concorde. In the nineteenth century, the now familiar obelisk and fountains were brought to the site, further obscuring its bloody associations. 2 (p. 367) the toilettes of flaring Jezebels: In the Bible (2 Kings 9), Jezebel is the wife of King Ahab; her name has become synonymous for loose and malevolent women from all periods of history. Dickens invokes her name here as a strategy of giving the Revolution a biblical, universal resonance, as he does in his use of “The Vengeance” (see note 1 for chapter 22, the second book). 3 (p. 367) churches that are not my father’s house but dens of thieves: This is a reference to the Bible, Mark 11:17: “And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves” (KJV). 4 (p. 368) “If thou be changed into this shape, . . . then resume thy former aspect!”: There are many magical transformations in The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments ; this passage refers to “The Second Kalandar’s Tale,” in which a  princess turns an ape back into his natural state as a man with words close to these. It is an ironic reference, however, as no superficial power of magic can reverse the changes wrought by history. 5 (p. 371) One of the most remarkable sufferers: Dickens is thinking of Madame Roland, who, being denied on the scaffold the opportunity to write her final thoughts, proceeded to utter her famous indictment of the “Liberty” in whose name she was to be executed (see note 2 for chapter 6, above). \n\n INSPIRED BY  A TALE OF TWO CITIES \n\n# Film\n Among the renditions of A Tale of Two Cities —including three silent movies, Ralph Thomas’s 1958 British production, and a version televised in 1980—Jack Conway’s 1935 film is best remembered. The lavish production stars Ronald Colman as the alcoholic antihero Sydney Carton, Elizabeth Allan as Lucie Manette, and Basil Rathbone as Darnay’s despotic uncle, the Marquis. Conway’s film bristles with dramatic tension: the love triangle created when both Carton and Darnay fall in love with Lucie, the terror caused by the continuous falling of the guillotine, and the intense trial scenes. Lush with historical costumes and sets, the film adheres closely to Dickens’s original. A Tale of Two Cities was nominated for two Oscars in 1936: Outstanding Production (Best Film) and Best Editing. Its producer, movie mogul David O. Selznick, also produced David Copperfield , released the same year. Elizabeth Allan, Edna May Oliver, and Basil Rathbone had supporting roles in both adaptations. \n\n# A Far Better Rest\n “To-day they guillotined Danton; and with him died the fragile dream of Clemency, and all my hopes and prayers. For if Danton the Colossus has succumbed to the Terror, this ravenous Goddess who has devoured or corrupted the best of France, what chance has any of us?” So begins Susanne Alleyn’s debut novel, A Far Better Rest (New York: Soho Press, 2000). Written in eighteenth-century language and told from Sydney Carton’s point of view, the novel takes its title from the last line of A Tale of Two Cities : “ ‘It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.’ ”  In Dickens’s classic, Carton disappears in London and is absent from much of the novel’s action, returning in Paris to bring the story to its tragic conclusion. A Far Better Rest , which takes place while Carton awaits his fate at the guillotine’s blade, fills in the missing chronology of his actions. Written as Carton’s impassioned journal,  the novel chronicles his devotion to Lucie Manette, his public life in French politics, his struggle with alcoholism, and his heroic rescue of Charles Darnay. Rich in historical detail (in Paris, Carton studies alongside the revolutionaries Maximilien Robespierre and Camille Desmoulins), Alleyn’s novel presents an intimate account of the French Revolution, in contrast to Dickens’s sweeping epic. \n\n# The Jackal\n It opens with the famous first line “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,” but otherwise the rock opera The Jackal , by Melbourne composer-lyricist Desmond J. Flannery, diverges markedly from Dickens’s novel. The Jackal takes its title from the fifth chapter in the second book of A Tale of Two Cities . It focuses on the relationship between the eminent lawyer Mr. Stryver and his disenchanted assistant Sydney Carton. Flannery sets this tense, power-shifting partnership against operatic and classical compositions as well as hard-edged, guitar-driven music. The Jackal is clearly influenced by Flannery’s tenure in the West End’s production of Jesus Christ Superstar in the 1980s and bears similarities similar to the popular musical Les Misérables . Characteristic of its larger-than-life genre, it has qualities of a 1960s or ’70s musical that oddly, instead of dating it as either anachronistic or topically limited, create a contemporary feel. Flannery has produced an album recording of The Jackal that features a twenty-three member, Broadway seasoned ensemble. He hopes to mount a full stage production. \n\n COMMENTS & QUESTIONS  In this section, we aim to provide the reader with an array of perspectives on the text, as well as questions that challenge those perspectives.The commentary has been culled from sources as diverse as reviews contemporaneous with the work, letters written by the author, literary criticism of later generations, and appreciations written throughout the work’s history. Following the commentary, a series of questions seeks to filter Charles Dickens’s A Tale of Two Cities through a variety of points of view and bring about a richer understanding of this enduring work. \n\n# Comments\n MARK TWAIN  I have always been a great admirer of Dickens, and his ‘Tale of Two Cities’ I read at least every two years.  —from Abroad with Mark Twain and Eugene Field (1922)  \nCHARLES DICKENS  I set myself the little task of making a picturesque story , rising in every chapter, with characters true to nature, but whom the story should express more than they should express themselves by dialogue. I mean in other words, that I fancied a story of incident might be written (in place of the odious stuff that is written under that pretence), pounding the characters in its own mortar, and beating their interest out of them. If you could have read the story all at once, I hope you wouldn’t have stopped halfway.  —from a letter to John Forster (August 29, 1859)  \nSIR JAMES FITZJAMES STEPHEN  It would not, indeed, be matter of much difficulty to frame from such a book as the Tale of Two Cities regular recipes for grotesque and pathetic writing, by which any required quantity of the article might be produced with infallible certainty. The production of pathos is the simpler operation of the two. With a little practice and a good deal of determination, it would really be easy to harrow up people’s feelings as to poke the fire. The whole art is to take a melancholy subject, and rub the reader’s nose in it, and this does not require any particular  amount either of skill or knowledge. Every one knows, for example, that death is a solemn and affecting thing. If, therefore, it is wished to make a pathetic impression on the reader, the proper course is to introduce a death-bed scene, and to rivet attention to it by specifying all its details. Almost any subject will do, because the pathetic power of the scene lies in the fact of the death; and the artifice employed consists simply in enabling the notion of death to be reiterated at short intervals by introducing a variety of irrelevant trifles which suspend attention for the moment, and allow it after an interval to revert to death with the additional impulse derived from the momentary contrast. The process of doing this to almost any conceivable extent is so simple that it becomes, with practice, almost mechanical. To describe light and shade of the room in which the body lies, the state of the bedclothes, the conversation of the servants, the sound of the undertaker’s footsteps, the noise of driving the coffin-screws, and any number of other minutiae, is in effect a device for working on the feelings by repeating at intervals, Death—death—death—death—death, just as feeling of another class might be worked upon by continually calling a man a liar or a thief. It is an old remark, that if dirt enough is thrown some of it will stick; and Mr. Dickens’s career shows that the same is true of pathos. . . .  The moral tone of the Tale of Two Cities is not more wholesome than that of its predecessors, nor does it display any nearer approach to a solid knowledge of the subject-matter to which it refers. Mr. Dickens observes in his preface—“It has been one of my hopes to add something to the popular and the picturesque means of understanding that terrible time, though no one can hope to add anything to the philosophy of Mr. Carlyle’s wonderful book.” The allusion to Mr. Carlyle confirms the presumption which the book itself raises, that Mr. Dickens happened to have read the History of the French Revolution, and, being on the look-out for a subject, determined off-hand to write a novel about it. Whether he has any other knowledge of the subject than a single reading of Mr. Carlyle’s work would supply does not appear, but certainly what he has written shows no more. It is exactly the sort of story which a man would write who had taken down Mr. Carlyle’s theory without any sort of inquiry or examination, but with a comfortable conviction that “nothing more could be added to its philosophy.” . . .  We must say one word in conclusion as to the illustrations. They are thoroughly worthy of the text. It is impossible to imagine faces and figures more utterly unreal, or more wretchedly conventional, than those by which Mr. Browne represents Mr. Dickens’s characters. The handsome faces are caricatures, and the ugly ones are like nothing human.  —from the Saturday Review (December 17, 1859)  \nTHE SUNDAY TIMES  The value and earnestness of criticism are not to be measured by its prolixity; and if we dismiss within the space of a paragraph a work on which whole columns of shrewdest analysis and warmest panegyric would not be thrown away, let no reader suspect us of want either of respect for the illustrious author, or of appreciation of what we must deliberately pronounce to be one of the very greatest productions of his prolific pen. We are not unmindful of the vulgar abuse which has been heaped upon “A Tale of Two Cities” and its writer by the Saturday Review ; but we shall not give up our gratitude to the latter, nor our admiration for the former, at the instigation of any such low-bred cynicism as that in which it is the habit of our contemporary to indulge. It may be possible to manufacture pathos by a mere mechanical process; but it does not require even the ingenuity of the artisan to produce the cold-blooded and undiscriminating censori ousness which is the only distinctive quality of the Saturday Review .  —January 22, 1860  \nANDREW LANG  The Genius of Charles Dickens, how brilliant she is! dwelling by a fountain of laughter imperishable; though there is something of an alien salt in the neighbouring fountain of tears. How poor the world of fancy would be, how ‘dispeopled of her dreams,’ if, in some ruin of the social system, the books of Dickens were lost.  —from Letters to Dead Authors (1886) \n\n# Questions\n 1. What is Dickens’s understanding of mob psychology? Does he get it right? 2. Is Madame Defarge a plausible character? Why? 3. Dickens clearly sees the Manette household, presided over by Lucie, as a repository of value, a private sanctuary from public spying, madness, and violence. To some readers, however, it has seemed frail, and in any case, more a product of the author’s values than his observation of reality. What do you think? 4. Would the novel be better without Sydney Carton’s sacrificial act and final speech? \n\n FOR FURTHER READING \n\n# Also by Charles Dickens\n Sketches by Boz (1836)  The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club (Pickwick Papers, 1836-1837)  Oliver Twist (1837-1838)  Nicholas Nickleby (1838-1839)  The Old Curiosity Shop (1840-1841)  Barnaby Rudge (1841)  American Notes (1842)  Martin Chuzzlewit (1843-1844)  Pictures from Italy (1846)  Dombey and Son (1846-1848)  David Copperfield (1849-1850)  Christmas Books (1852): includes A Christmas Carol (1843), The Chimes (1844), The Cricket on the Hearth (1845), The Battle of Life (1846), The Haunted Man (1848)  Bleak House (1852-1853)  Hard Times (1854)  Little Dorrit (1855-1857)  Great Expectations (1860-1861)  Our Mutual Friend (1864-1865)  The Mystery of Edwin Drood (unfinished, 1870) \n\n# On Dickens’s Life and Times\n Ackroyd, Peter.

The backdrop of the novel takes place in London and Paris prior to the French Revolution. The novel, told in three parts, has been adapted into numerous productions for film, theater, radio, and television.\nIn 1775, a banker named Jarvis Lorry travels to Dover, where he meets a young, half-French woman named Lucie Manette. Together, the pair travel to Paris to recover her father, Alexandre Manette. Once a successful doctor, Manette was, for unknown reasons, imprisoned 18 years ago in the infamous Bastille prison. He has now been released and is in the care of a former servant named Ernest Defarge, who now runs a wine-shop in the impoverished Saint Antoine district of Paris. Doctor Manette’s long imprisonment has left him in a bad psychological state; he is largely unaware of his surroundings and constantly busies himself making shoes. His daughter’s arrival seems to spark some signs of recognition in him, however, and the group departs for England.\nFive years later, Lucie and Manette (now largely recovered) are witnesses in a treason case in London. The defendant is a young Frenchman named Charles Darnay, whom they initially met on the crossing from Calais. It initially seems likely that Darnay will be convicted of being a French spy, but at the last moment Darnay’s legal team asks whether Darnay might have been misidentified by a witness. To prove the plausibility of this, one of the lawyers—a man named Sydney Carton—stands up, revealing himself to look very much like Darnay. \nOver the next several months, Darnay and Carton pay several visits to the Manettes at their London home; both men fall in love with Lucie, but where Darnay is hardworking, courteous, and noble, Carton is a cynical and depressed alcoholic. Darnay and Lucie eventually become engaged, while Carton, in confessing his love for Lucie, swears that he would give his life to keep her and those she loves safe.\nMeanwhile, change is underway in France. Shortly after his trial, Darnay had visited his uncle, who is revealed to be a corrupt and cruel nobleman: the Marquis St. Evrémonde. On the night of Darnay’s visit, however, the Marquis was killed by the father of a peasant boy he had run over with his carriage earlier that day. The man—Gaspard—is arrested and executed, but the events surrounding the murder generate further interest in a revolutionary society headed by Defarge and his wife Thérèse.Darnay and Lucie marry, with Doctor Manette’s permission, although Manette suffers a brief relapse after learning Darnay’s true name. Several years pass in domestic bliss, and Darnay and Lucie have a daughter (also named Lucie). By the time the child is 6 events have come to a head in France; led by the Defarges, the French peasantry storm the Bastille and execute its guards. More violence quickly follows, with the killing of a government official and the arson of the Marquis’s former mansion.\nThree years after the French Revolution begins, Darnay receives a letter from a man named Gabelle, whom he had entrusted with the disposal of the Evrémonde property after Darnay himself renounced it. Gabelle is now accused of aiding an “emigrant”—an aristocrat who has fled France—and asks Darnay to come to Paris and speak for him. Darnay, trusting in his record of sympathy with the French peasantry, agrees. When he arrives in Paris, however, he is arrested and placed in La Force prison.\nLucie and Doctor Manette quickly follow Darnay to France; Manette’s imprisonment under the French monarchy has made him a national celebrity there, and he hopes to use this public sympathy to secure Darnay’s release. Even as France descends deeper into violence, it appears that Manette may be successful; a little over a year after his initial arrest, Darnay appears in court, and Manette’s testimony on his behalf secures his acquittal. Later that night, however, Darnay is re-arrested. At his trial the next day, a statement written by Manette during his imprisonment is read aloud: it describes how Manette was imprisoned by Darnay’s uncle and father because he had treated (and consequently knew about) a young peasant woman raped by one of the Evrémonde brothers, and a boy (her brother) who was fatally injured trying to defend her. These two victims of the Evrémondes were Madame Defarge’s older siblings, and their deaths are what have made her so bitter and vengeful.\nDarnay is sentenced to death, and even Manette proves powerless to save him; his attempts to speak to those in power only cause him to relapse into his traumatized state. In the meantime, however, Carton has arrived in Paris and devised a plan. Carton instructs Lorry (in Paris attending to his bank’s business) to ensure that Lucie, her father, and her child leave France the day of the execution; Madame Defarge will seek revenge on the rest of Darnay’s family next. He also entrusts his own travel papers to Lorry.\nCarton successfully blackmails one of Darnay’s jailers (whom he knows to be an English spy) into allowing him to see Darnay. Once inside the cell, he drugs Darnay and takes his place, while Darnay himself, in the guise of Carton, leaves Paris with his family and Lorry. Belatedly, Madame Defarge arrives at the Manettes’ former Paris residence hoping to find and arrest Lucie, only to be killed in a struggle with Miss Pross, Lucie’s devoted maid. Meanwhile, Carton is taken to the guillotine in Darnay’s place. After comforting a young seamstress condemned alongside him, Carton mounts the scaffold, finally at peace with himself and his life.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.supersummary.com/a-tale-of-two-cities/", "author": "Charles Dickens", "characters": {"Sydney Carton": "Sydney Carton is an English lawyer who first appears as one of two attorneys defending Charles Darnay during his trial at the Old Bailey. He bears an uncanny resemblance to Darnay and uses this resemblance to cast doubt on key witnesses’ statements. However, while this legal strategy is Carton’s idea, he allows his partner, Stryver, to present it and claim credit for it. It soon becomes clear that this is typical of Carton; in fact, the narrator describes him at one point as the “jackal” who does the hunting (i.e. professional legwork) for Stryver’s “lion” (90). Carton, meanwhile, presents himself as lazy, apathetic, and unprofessional, staring at the ceiling during court cases and drinking heavily on (and off) the job. In more personal interactions, Carton also tends towards rudeness and sarcasm; when Darnay remarks, for instance, that he doesn’t think Carton likes him, Carton quips, “I begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding” (88).Why Carton acts this way is a mystery Dickens never fully explains. Beneath his careless and insolent demeanor, Carton appears to loathe himself; after his dinner with Darnay, for example, he berates himself for “fall[ing] away” (89) from the other man’s nobility and steadfastness. Nevertheless, Carton is certain that he can “never be better than [he is]” (156)—in part, no doubt, because he is aware of how strong his addiction is. With that said, Carton’s despair seems to extend beyond his alcoholism; he is prone to bouts of moodiness, often wandering the city aimlessly at night only to “thr[ow] himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed” (95). Dickens hints that this depression and hopelessness stem partly from early and repeated disappointments, such as losing both his parents at a young age.In other words, Carton is cynical less by nature than by learning, which explains why he falls so passionately in love with Lucie Manette: as someone who is almost inhumanly gentle, pure, and compassionate, Lucie represents ideals that Carton struggles to find elsewhere in the world or in himself. Although Carton insists that nothing can come of this “last dream of [his] soul” (157), this ultimately proves untrue; Carton lives up to (and arguably surpasses) the selflessness of characters like Lucie when he sacrifices his life to save Darnay. In this way, Carton’s character arc is the culmination of one of the novel’s major themes: the possibility of redemption. Carton goes from a deathlike state—he describes himself as someone “who died young” (156)—to someone who can give life to others; in fact, he becomes a Christ-like figure in the novel’s final chapters, with the selflessness of his death not only saving Darnay, but also atoning for the horrors of pre-revolutionary and revolutionary France.  ", "Charles Darnay (Charles Evrémonde)": "Charles Darnay is a young Frenchman living in England at the time Dickens introduces him. Although he first appears as a prisoner on trial for treason, Darnay is handsome, noble, and hard-working; in fact, it is his virtuousness that has gotten him in trouble, not only because it leads him to sympathize with the American Revolution (a suspicious position in 18th-century England), but also because it places him at odds with his aristocratic uncle, who has actually engineered his arrest.This uncle is the Marquis St. Evrémonde, who also happens to be the French nobleman who raped Madame Defarge’s elder sister and imprisoned Doctor Manette to ensure that the story didn’t get out. Darnay is not aware of the full extent of his family’s depravity, but is uncomfortable enough with their abuse of the lower classes that he renounces his title and inheritance, instead establishing a career for himself as a French tutor; as he puts it, he chooses “to live by his own industry in England, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France” (293). In a sense, Darnay joins the ranks of the hardworking English middle-class, which Dickens contrasts favorably with the decadent and predatory French upper classes.Nevertheless, Darnay can’t entirely escape his aristocratic background. Although Doctor Manette consents to Darnay’s marriage to Lucie, the knowledge of who Darnay truly is causes him great distress in the immediate aftermath of the wedding. Even more to the point, Darnay’s own good character is unable to save him when he returns to France during the Revolution. Darnay travels there in the hopes of vouching for a man in his employment, but the Evrémondes are so hated in France (and, in particular, by Madame Defarge) that Darnay is tainted by his family’s guilt and nearly forced to pay for their sins; it is only Carton’s intervention that spares Darnay’s life.", "Lucie Manette": "Lucie Manette is the daughter of Doctor Manette, who was imprisoned in the Bastille before her birth. Her mother (who was English) also died when Lucie was young, and she grew up in England under the care of her maid, Miss Pross. When she is a teenager, however, Lucie learns that her father is not in fact dead (as she had been told), and that he has been released from prison. Together with Mr. Lorry, she travels to Paris to find him, and her love and devotion ultimately pull him back from the stupor into which he sunk while imprisoned. She is such a dedicated daughter, in fact, that she initially hesitates to marry Darnay for fear that it might cause her father pain.This turns out not to be the case. Marrying Darnay only draws Lucie closer to her father, without at all affecting her ability to fulfill her role as a wife and mother: Many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her ‘What is the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us, as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to have too much to do?’ (221). Lucie, in other words, is a nearly a perfect woman by 19th-century standards: she is endlessly selfless and merciful, and these qualities come so naturally to her that she barely seems to exert any effort to support and inspire those around her. Even her housekeeping seems to flow naturally from her personality, and has a wholesome effect on those who witness it: The disposition of everything in the rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours; the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once […] pleasant in themselves, and […] expressive of their originator (97-98). As an idealized Victorian woman, Lucie also serves as a foil to women like the Vengeance and (especially) Madame Defarge, whose suffering under the Ancien Régime has made them bloodthirsty, hardhearted, and (by the standards of the time) unfeminine. In particular, the “golden thread” of Lucie’s hair contrasts with Madame Defarge’s knitting: as Madame Defarge uses her knitting to plot the downfalls of her enemies, Lucie symbolically “wind[s] the golden thread which [binds] her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and companion, in a life of quiet bliss” (218). ", "Thérèse Defarge": "Thérèse Defarge is the wife of the wine-shop owner Ernest Defarge, as well as the sole surviving member of a peasant family that were once tenants on the Evrémondes’ estate. When she was a young girl, her older sister was raped by Charles Darnay’s uncle—the younger Evrémonde brother who ultimately becomes the Marquis. This same man also killed Thérèse’s older brother in a duel and contributed to the deaths (by natural causes) of her brother-in-law and father. Thérèse herself was taken away and raised by a family of fishermen, but never forgave the Evrémondes for the role they played in the deaths of her birth family. Although she initially seems to merely support her husband’s revolutionary activities, it eventually becomes clear that she is their mastermind, patiently but doggedly waiting for a chance to strike back at the Evrémonde family. This is nowhere clearer than in Dickens’s descriptions of Madame Defarge’s knitting, which, in addition to being a literal record of those marked for execution, is also a symbol of the relentless forces propelling France toward revolution: at one point, for instance, Dickens describes her “pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it were the finger of Fate” (277). This determination to see not only Darnay but also his wife and child executed makes Madame Defarge much more extreme in her views than her husband, who hints to her that he fears the Revolution is going too far.The Defarge’s relationship, in other words, reverses many of the gender norms associated with 19th-century marriage: Thérèse Defarge is less merciful than her husband, and often succeeds in bending him to her will. This in turn reflects the ways in which Dickens uses femininity as a measure of how far astray first the French aristocracy and later the French Revolution have gone. In effect, years of oppression and loss have twisted Madame Defarge’s “natural” womanly feelings (specifically, her love for her family) into an “unwomanly” desire for revenge. ", "Ernest Defarge": "Ernest Defarge is a wine-shop keeper in Saint Antoine, and the husband of Thérèse Defarge. As a young boy, he worked as a servant for Doctor Manette, and he acts as Manette’s caretaker after the doctor is released from prison but before he can be reunited with his daughter. By the time the novel opens (1775), Defarge is already involved in a revolutionary society; in fact, in an attempt to drum up more popular outrage, Defarge allows select members of this group to privately view Doctor Manette, whose imprisonment has left him in a nearly catatonic state. As the years pass, Defarge remains as committed as ever to bringing about an uprising, and ultimately plays a central role in the storming of the Bastille; as Dickens puts it, Defarge is “a man of a strong resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn the man” (35). Defarge’s devotion to the Revolution is tempered by compassion in a way that his wife’s is not. He is particularly uncomfortable with the thought of anything happening to his former master—so much so that Madame Defarge ultimately leaves him out of her plot to denounce Lucie Manette. There are hints, however, that Defarge had misgivings about the course the Revolution had taken even before this. For instance, while he does his “duty […] to [his] country and the People” (263) by turning Darnay over to the authorities on his arrival in Paris, he also asks exasperatedly: “In the name of that sharp female born and called La Guillotine, why did you [Darnay] come to France?” (262). Defarge’s relatively moderate views don’t bode well for his future under the new regime, and in Carton’s closing visions of the future, Defarge is in fact ultimately executed.", "Doctor Alexandre Manette": "Alexandre Manette is Lucie Manette’s father. As the novel opens, Manette has just been released from the Bastille after 18 years’ imprisonment. Prior to his captivity, Manette had been a successful physician, and was in fact imprisoned in order to prevent him from speaking about two patients he had treated: the peasant boy and girl who died at the hands of the powerful Evrémonde family. Manette’s long imprisonment takes a toll on him: when Lorry and Lucie first see him, he is emaciated and, despite only being middle-aged, entirely white-haired. Worse yet, he doesn’t seem fully aware of who or where he is, focusing all of his attention on making shoes—a pastime he picked up in prison.With Lucie’s love and care, Doctor Manette eventually recovers his wits and his health; he once again begins practicing medicine and appears “intellectual of face and upright of bearing” (82). He grows troubled and quiet from time to time, apparently remembering his imprisonment. These fits of “abstraction” (82) come to a head when Lucie marries Darnay—the son of one of the two brothers who arranged for Manette’s imprisonment—and Manette temporarily succumbs to the belief that he is once more in prison.When Darnay himself is arrested years later, it at first seems that Manette will finally be able to make peace with his imprisonment: “For the first time, he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison door of his daughter’s husband, and deliver him” (281). In other words, it is Manette rather than Carton who initially seems poised to act as a Christ figure, with his past suffering “redeeming” Darnay in the present. Ultimately, however, even Manette is tainted by his experiences under the Ancien Régime; while in prison, he gave in to hatred and denounced the entire Evrémonde family in a written statement. Although Manette has clearly changed his mind since then, the statement convinces the jury to convict Darnay. Ultimately, Darnay is only saved through the intervention of someone entirely outside the cycle of oppression and revenge that has hold of France, and that managed to (temporarily) corrupt even a noble and generous man like Doctor Manette.", "Jarvis Lorry": "Jarvis Lorry is a banker at Tellson’s, and often travels between the bank’s Paris and London offices (the name “Lorry” in fact hints at the role he plays in conveying people and information from one place to another). When the novel opens, Lorry is roughly sixty and somewhat set in his ways; he is “orderly and methodical” (20) in appearance, and repeatedly insists that he is simply a “man of business” with “no time for [feelings], and no chance of them” (26). In keeping with this, Lorry has never married, and when he suggests that he might have, Miss Pross regards the idea as ridiculous, exclaiming that he was “a bachelor in [his] cradle” (200). Lorry’s main passion in life at first seems to be faithfully carrying out his responsibilities at Tellson’s; he even travels to revolutionary France in the hopes of saving bank papers from destruction.Despite his best efforts, however, Lorry isn’t entirely able to transform himself into a “mere machine” (25). Although he insists to Lucie that Doctor Manette was merely a professional acquaintance, he is clearly horrified by the thought of the ordeal Manette has undergone in prison. He also becomes deeply attached to Lucie, even numbering among the few people to attend her wedding. Ultimately, Lorry is forced to acknowledge that it is these human connections that have truly made his life worthwhile. When Sydney Carton reminds Lorry that Lucie would mourn his death, Lorry replies, “Yes, yes, thank God. I didn’t quite mean what I said [that nobody would weep for him]” (322).", "Mr. Stryver": "Stryver is an English lawyer who helps secure Charles Darnay’s acquittal during his trial at the Old Bailey. Unlike his partner, Sydney Carton, Stryver welcomes the spotlight and presents all their cases in court. However, while Stryver is an ambitious man, he doesn’t have the skills necessary to secure advancement in his field: It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is among the most striking and necessary of the advocate’s accomplishments (90). Stryver therefore relies on Carton to prepare his cases for him, while he himself relaxes and drinks. Far from being grateful for Carton’s efforts, however, Stryver continually scolds him for not showing more “energy and purpose” (93) in life. In fact, Stryver has little self-awareness in any area of his life; he considers himself charming and desirable, for instance, and is certain that Lucie will gratefully accept his proposal of marriage. In reality, Stryver is a coarse and pompous man whom Dickens describes as “little more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout, loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy” (83). Characteristically, Stryver quickly comes to see his failed proposal as Lucie’s loss, eventually marrying a widow whose property will help advance his prospects in life. Ultimately, Stryver’s self-serving behavior makes him a foil for Carton, whose cynical exterior actually conceals great idealism and selflessness.", "Miss Pross": "Miss Pross is Lucie Manette’s maid, but since she has served her mistress since she was a young girl, she in many ways functions as Lucie’s mother. Miss Pross idolizes Lucie for her beauty, sweetness, and sensitivity, despite not being beautiful or delicate herself; she is introduced as a “wild-looking woman […] all of a red colour” with “brawny hand[s]” (29) whom Lorry nearly mistakes for a man. In addition to being somewhat masculine in appearance, Miss Pross is also unusually outspoken and sharp-tongued for a woman, particularly when it comes to anyone she suspects of harming Lucie.As her protectiveness of Lucie suggests, however, Miss Pross is conventionally feminine in the way that, for Dickens, is most important: she is deeply and selflessly devoted to those she loves, even to the point of being blind to their faults. Lorry, for instance, finds Miss Pross’s loyalty to her brother Solomon (i.e. Barsad) touching despite the fact that it is completely undeserved: Solomon was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped [Miss Pross] of everything she possessed, as a stake to speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with no touch of compunction. Miss Pross’s fidelity of belief in Solomon (deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her (100). In light of this, it’s significant that it is Miss Pross who ultimately kills Madame Defarge; like Miss Pross, Madame Defarge in many ways also flouts gender norms, but unlike Miss Pross, she is motivated largely by hatred rather than by love.", "The Marquis St. Evrémonde": "Technically, two people of this title appear in A Tale of Two Cities (not counting Charles Darnay, who renounces his inheritance early on). Darnay’s father was the Marquis St. Evrémonde at the time Doctor Manette was imprisoned; although he himself did not commit the outright crimes against the peasantry that his twin brother did, he views the lower classes with disdain and helps to cover up his brother’s actions by conspiring in Manette’s arrest.Darnay’s uncle, meanwhile, combines this callousness with outright sadism; his features, which are otherwise “like a fine mask,” are somewhat marred by two “dints” in his nose, which “[give] a look of treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance” (113). As a young man, he raped the elder sister of Thérèse Defarge and fatally wounded her brother in a duel. By the time the main action of the novel takes place, he has succeeded his brother as Marquis and delights in terrifying the French peasantry by nearly running them over in his carriage (eventually, he does strike and kill one boy). In fact, the Marquis’s sole regret seems to be that does not have unlimited power over the lower classes; he laments, for instance, that the family does not still enjoy “the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar” (127). That being the case, he has no sympathy with his nephew’s democratic sensibilities, and even arranges for Darnay to be tried for treason in an attempt to kill him. The Marquis’s cruelty eventually comes back to haunt him, however; he is murdered in his bed by Gaspard, the father of the boy he ran over.", "Jerry Cruncher": "Jerry Cruncher is a working-class man employed by Tellson’s for various odd jobs. Unbeknownst to his employers, however, he also robs graves one the side, supplying corpses for doctors and medical students to study and practice on. This is an extremely disreputable profession, but Cruncher has no patience with his wife’s intense feelings of guilt and fear; in fact, he beats her whenever he catches her praying on his behalf. This in turn makes it all the more ironic that Cruncher describes himself as a “Resurrection-Man” (170). Although his work involves bringing people back from the dead (or, at least, from their graves), it is starkly opposed to the kind of spiritual rebirth the novel is mostly concerned with. Ultimately, however, Cruncher himself experiences this form of moral resurrection, since his experiences in revolutionary France frighten him so much that he resolves to give up grave-robbing and treat his wife with more kindness. ", "The Seamstress": "Although she only appears in the novel briefly and is never named, the seamstress who is executed alongside Sydney Carton is central to both his development and A Tale of Two Cities’ themes. Unlike the novel’s other characters, who view Carton as at best a pitiable figure, the seamstress looks up to and relies on Carton for strength in the last moments of her life; she knows nothing about his background, and therefore sees him only as a man who is sacrificing himself for the sake of someone else. In speaking with her, then, Carton is finally able to secure what he earlier hinted he never had before: the “love and attachment, the gratitude [and] respect” of a fellow “human creature” (322).The seamstress also serves as a commentary on what Dickens sees as the failings of the French Revolution. In addition to being young and innocent, the seamstress is a member of the very class the Revolution promised to uplift; far from conspiring against the new regime, the seamstress says she is “not unwilling to die, if the Republic, which is to do so much good to [the] poor, will profit by [her] death” (368). The fact that she is condemned and executed reveals the extent to which the Revolution has betrayed the principles that originally motivated it, become simply one more oppressive regime.", "John Barsad (Solomon Pross)": "John Barsad is a spy whose true name is Solomon Pross. He is the brother of Miss Pross and stole a hefty sum of money from her before disappearing from her life. By the time of Darnay’s trial in London, he has taken the name Barsad and is working as a spy and professional fixer; in fact, he is testifying against Darnay on the orders of Darnay’s uncle, the Marquis St. Evrémonde. He later collects information for the French monarchy, before finally turning up as a spy in the French Republic’s prisons—probably, Sydney Carton guesses, as a double-agent in the pay of the English government. Carton blackmails Barsad into helping him switch places with Darnay, and Barsad, for all his own failings, is impressed enough by Carton’s sacrifice that he tries to quiet the people who jeer at him on his way to execution. In his final vision, Carton foresees that Barsad will also fall victim to the Revolution.", "Monseigneur": "Monseigneur first appears as a nobleman whose favor the Marquis St. Evrémonde is seeking. He is noteworthy, even amongst the French nobility, for his decadence: Dickens introduces Monseigneur by noting that he requires four separate servants just to take his morning hot chocolate. However, over the next several pages (and for the rest of the novel), “Monseigneur” comes to stand in for the entire French aristocracy. In this respect, his most notable qualities are his greed, his preoccupation with his own pleasure, and his blindness to the anger of the French people; Dickens describes Monseigneur as a parasite “rapidly swallowing France” (108) who can’t fathom that the status quo might not “see the very stars out” (112). Once the Revolution is underway, Monseigneur becomes a symbol for the aristocrats who flee the country: “Monseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his not being appreciated: of his being so little wanted in France, as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it, and this life together” (243). In this way, Dickens portrays much of the French aristocracy as both opportunistic and cowardly; having drained the country of everything they can, they leave rather than face the consequences of their actions.", "The Mender of Roads/The Wood-Sawyer": "The mender of roads is a rather gullible man who becomes involved in the Defarges’ plots. He initially works near the Marquis’s chateau and sees Gaspard on the day he murders the Marquis (later on, he also witnesses Gaspard’s arrest). Defarge brings the mender to Paris to testify to these events, and he and his wife begin to groom the mender for eventual participation in the Revolution. By the time of Darnay’s imprisonment, the mender of roads is working as a wood-sawyer near La Force prison; he is entirely under the control of Madame Defarge, and willing to say that he witnessed Lucie passing coded signals to prisoners as she stood on the street outside La Force.", "Jacques Three": "In a nod to the Jacquerie (a 14th-century peasant uprising), the members of the revolutionary society Defarge belongs to all go by the name “Jacques.” Most of these men are background figures, but “Jacques Three” stands out somewhat: he is often associated with images of hunger and consumption, and Dickens at one point characterizes him as a “life-thirsty, cannibal-looking, bloody-minded” (328) man. These kinds of descriptions work alongside the motif of predators and prey in the novel; after being preyed upon by the aristocracy, Jacques Three becomes a predator himself. ", "The Vengeance": "The Vengeance is the wife of a grocer in Saint Antoine, and a “lieutenant” (231) of Madame Defarge’s. Even more than Madame Defarge, however, she represents the distortion of traditional femininity under the revolutionary regime; she is just as bloodthirsty and vindictive as her leader (whom she eagerly backs up at every turn), but she lacks Madame Defarge’s sympathetic backstory. In fact, she is never even given a name in the text beyond “the Vengeance”—a nickname she earns after the fall of the Bastille. True to her name, she is essentially the personification of the desire for revenge.  ", "Gaspard": "Like the Defarges, Gaspard is a resident of the impoverished Saint Antoine neighborhood. He first appears scrawling the word “blood” on a wall, using spilled wine for ink. Defarge scolds Gaspard for his rashness, foreshadowing Gaspard’s later impulsive actions: when his son is struck by the Marquis’s carriage and killed, Gaspard hitches a ride on the underside of the coach, and then kills the Marquis in his sleep. He is later caught and executed, but his actions help inspire the later revolution. ", "Gabelle": "Gabelle is the tax collector and postmaster in the village near the Marquis’s chateau. As such, he is largely a servant of the Evrémonde family, and manages the family property in Darnay’s absence, with the ultimate intent of restoring it to the French people. However, his association with the Evrémondes nearly kills him twice—first when the Marquis’s chateau is burned down, and later when he is accused of helping an emigrant (i.e. Darnay). He writes to Darnay after his arrest asking him to come to Paris and defend him, setting in motion the events of Book 3. ", "Roger Cly": "Like Barsad, Roger Cly is a spy and conman. He testifies against Darnay at his trial in London before public opinion in England forces him to fake his own death and escape to France, where he eventually surfaces as a spy in the French prisons.", "Little Lucie": "“Little” Lucie is Lucie Manette and Charles Darnay’s daughter. She is approximately nine when her father returns to France and remains in Paris with her mother for the duration of Darnay’s imprisonment. Perhaps the most significant thing about her is her fondness for Sydney Carton; the implication is that Lucie, in her childish innocence, can see Carton’s inner nobility in a way that more cynical adults cannot.  ", "Young Jerry and Mrs. Cruncher": "“Young” Jerry is Jerry Cruncher’s son. He resembles his father closely in temperament, and often accompanies him on odd jobs for Tellson’s; he also attempts to curry favor with his father by saying he wants to be a “Resurrection-Man” (despite having been badly frightened by the sight of his father digging up a grave). Mrs. Cruncher, by contrast, feels intense religious guilt over her husband’s trade and often prays on his behalf, angering both him and her son."}, "chapter_summaries": {"Book 1, Chapter 1 Summary: “The Period”": "The novel opens in 1775, which the narrator describes as an era much like his own in its contradictions and divisions; rationality and optimism compete with “foolishness” and “despair\" to create both a “season of Light” and a “season of Darkness” (5).From here, the narrator moves on to compare France and England: “There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France” (5). In other ways, the two countries are quite similar; superstition, oppression, and violence loom large in each. The English, for instance, are preoccupied with religious prophecies and supposed hauntings even as their American colonies are on the verge of rebelling. Law and order are also in shambles, and not only because the country is plagued by highway robbers; the English courts are just as willing to execute a “wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer’s boy of sixpence” as they are an “atrocious murderer” (7).In France, meanwhile, a young man is tortured and put to death for failing to kneel to a group of passing monks. The narrator notes, however, that even as this man is being executed, the “Woodman, Fate” and the “Farmer, Death” (6) are gathering together the materials that will eventually be used to build guillotines, and to transport prisoners to them. The governments of both France and England, however, remain oblivious to these threats, even as “the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct[s] their greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures—the creatures of this chronicle among the rest—along the roads that [lie] before them” (7).", "Book 1, Chapter 2 Summary: “The Mail”": "One night in November, a coach carrying mail struggles along the Dover road. The journey is made dangerous by the threat of highway robbery, as well as by the bad weather; the road is so muddy that the passengers in the coach have had to get out and walk alongside it as it makes its way up a hill.Just as the passengers are preparing to get back inside, the coach driver hears someone approaching on horseback, and the guard accompanying the coach warns the stranger that he’ll shoot if necessary. The rider—a man called Jerry—replies that he’s carrying a message for a passenger named Jarvis Lorry. Mr. Lorry confirms that he knows Jerry from his job at Tellson’s Bank in London. Lorry, who explains that he is on his way to France, then reads the message aloud: it instructs him to wait in Dover for “Ma’amselle” (12). Lorry’s response, which he entrusts to Jerry, is “recalled to life” (12).Lorry reenters the coach, which drives on “with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it” (12). The driver and the guard discuss Lorry’s mysterious message but are unable to make sense of it. Jerry is also pondering Lorry’s response as he leads his horse down the hill: “‘Recalled to life.’ That’s a Blazing strange message. Much of that wouldn’t do for you, Jerry! […] You’d be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion” (14).", "Book 1, Chapter 3 Summary: “The Night Shadows”": "The narrator muses on how unknowable each individual person is to every other; ultimately, we can never fully know the thoughts and feelings even of our closest friends and family. This, he says, lies behind even the “awfulness” (15) of death, which completely forecloses the possibility of learning more about those around. However, this unknowability is also a form of equality; the narrator notes that Jerry, for example, is just as mysterious to his fellow humans as a king would be.The narrative then picks up with Jerry, who is still talking aloud to himself about the “recalled to life” (15) message as he rides back towards London. The narrator describes him as a somewhat “sinister” (15)looking man with dark eyes and spiky black hair, and he stops at several ale-houses on his return journey.Meanwhile, Mr. Lorry dozes in the mail coach. He is deeply aware of the fact that he is “on his way to dig some one out of a grave,” and imagines holding an entire conversation with this “spectre” (17). The man, who is roughly 45 but looks older, says that he has been “buried” (17) for 18 years, and isn’t sure whether he wants to return to life or not. He is also unsure whether he wants Mr. Lorry to bring him to see someone Lorry refers to as “her.” Lorry finally imagines digging the man out from underground, only to see him “fall away to dust” (18) before his eyes. Lorry runs through this exchange over and over again before he realizes that the sun has risen, “bright, placid, and beautiful” (18).", "Book 1, Chapters 1-3 Analysis": "As its title promises, the first chapter of A Tale of Two Cities provides a broad overview of the period in which the novel is set. This is important not only because Dickens is writing about an earlier era with which his readers may not be familiar, but also because A Tale of Two Cities is as much about sweeping historical forces as it is about individual characters. Specifically, the novel suggests that violence begets violence, and while this is true on a personal level, it also applies to entire oppressive regimes; as Dickens portrays it, the French Revolution (and the Reign of Terror in particular) are the inevitable reaction to centuries of exploitation and cruelty under the French monarchy (also known as the Ancien Régime). In some ways, the novel’s characters are simply at the mercy of these historical currents, as the image of the year sweeping them “along the roads that lay before them” suggests. With that said, it’s significant that the narrator likens the era he’s describing (1775-1793) to “the present period” (5)—1859, when the novel was published. The point here is not to encourage despair, but to draw the reader’s attention to the choices that ultimately made the French Revolution inevitable—in particular, the complacency of the upper classes, which Dickens suggests was (and is) just as much a problem in England as in France. Among other things, A Tale of Two Cities is a wake-up call to Victorian Britain, which was, like pre-revolutionary France, an extremely unequal and often exploitative society.Chapters 2 and 3, meanwhile, introduce one of the novel’s other central themes: the possibility of redemption, rebirth, and resurrection. These interrelated ideas take multiple forms in A Tale of Two Cities, two of which are hinted at in these chapters. First, and most clearly, Mr. Lorry imagines digging out someone who has been buried alive. In the following chapters, it becomes clear that he is traveling to meet a man who has been imprisoned for nearly two decades in a French prison—which is why Lorry sometimes pictures himself digging with “a great key” (18)—and whom Lorry hopes to restore to some semblance of his former life. This parallel Lorry draws between imprisonment and death (or at least burial) is significant because it begins to link the novel to specifically Christian concepts of redemption and resurrection, including the idea of death as a fate that Jesus’s crucifixion has “freed” humanity from.Mr. Lorry’s comment about “recalling to life” also causes Jerry Cruncher to speculate on the consequences literal, physical resurrection would have for him. Cruncher, it eventually emerges, is a grave-robber, and Dickens repeatedly reminds his readers that the slang for this job is a “Resurrection-Man.” In other words, Cruncher’s morally questionable activities function as a humorous distortion on the Christian worldview that informs much of the novel.   ", "Book 1, Chapter 4 Summary: “The Preparation\"": "Mr. Lorry arrives at a hotel in Dover, where he confirms that he can take a ship to Calais the next day. He takes off his winter clothing as he sits down to breakfast, revealing himself to be a “gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept” (20). He also asks the waiter to be on the lookout for the arrival of a young woman asking for him.The woman Lorry was waiting for—Lucie Manette—arrives that evening, and Lorry goes to see her. She is a 17-year-old girl with blond hair, blue eyes, and an expression “not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright fixed attention, though it included all of the four” (23).Lucie explains that she received word from Tellson’s that she needs to travel to Paris to settle a matter involving her deceased father’s property, and that Mr. Lorry would explain the situation to her. Lorry awkwardly confirms that this is so and begins to tell her the story of one of Tellson’s “customers” (25)—a French doctor who married an Englishwoman 20 years ago. At this point, Lucie guesses that Mr. Lorry was the person who brought her to England years ago, but Lorry continues to insist that he did so as a representative of Tellson’s and that he is a “mere machine” (25).Mr. Lorry continues, hinting that Lucie’s father is not in fact dead, but rather imprisoned by a powerful enemy. He grows increasingly uncomfortable as Lucie begs him to be clearer, urging her to view what he says as a “matter of business” (27). Finally, the rest of the story emerges: Lucie’s mother told her daughter her father was dead to spare her worry, and then died of grief while Lucie was still young. Now, however, her father has been found, and she must go to him and try to “restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort” (28). This disturbs Lucie, who says she will be seeing “his Ghost—not him” (28). She looks so stunned as Lorry tries to impress upon her the need for secrecy that he is eventually forced to call for her maid—a “brawny” (29) woman who scolds Lorry for upsetting her mistress and slowly revives her.", "Book 1, Chapter 5 Summary: “The Wine-Shop”": "A crowd of people gathers on a street in Saint Antoine to drink the wine that has spilled from a broken cask. As the wine mixes with dirt from the road, one man dips his finger in the mud and writes the word “blood” on a wall.Saint Antoine itself is a Parisian slum where “cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, [are] the lords in waiting” (32). Its residents are starving and prematurely aged, and virtually the only things still in good condition are “tools and weapons”—“the cutler’s knives and axes [are] sharp and bright, the smith’s hammers [are] heavy, and the gunmaker’s stock [is] murderous” (33). As people scramble for the last of the wine, a man—Monsieur Defarge—looks on from his wine-shop. He wipes the word “blood” off the wall and scolds the man who put it there—Gaspard—for writing the word so openly.Defarge then returns to his shop, where his wife—a “stout woman […] with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything” (35)—is knitting behind the counter. Ignoring the presence of an old man and a young woman, Defarge begins to talk with a couple of customers: the men all call one another “Jacques” and lament the fact that the crowd outside is so desperate for food and drink. At a signal from his wife, Defarge directs these men to a room on the fifth floor.After a brief conversation, Defarge takes the old man and the girl (who turn out to be Mr. Lorry and Lucie) into a “little black courtyard” (37) and up a filthy flight of stairs. As they walk, Defarge angrily explains that Doctor Manette, whom he had once worked for as a servant, is now so “changed” (38) that he must be kept alone in a locked room for his own safety.The men Defarge had spoken to earlier are peering into the garret when Defarge, Lorry, and Lucie arrive, but Defarge sends them away. Lorry questions whether it’s right to “make a show of Monsieur Manette” (40), but Defarge insists he has good reasons for doing so. He then unlocks the door and waves the others in, Miss Manette so frightened that Lorry has to support her. Defarge locks the door behind them as they notice “a white-haired man [sitting] on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes” (41).", "Book 1, Chapter 6 Summary: “The Shoemaker”": "Defarge greets Doctor Manette, who explains that he is “working” (42). He does not notice his daughter or Mr. Lorry, but when Defarge lets more light into the room, the pair see just how emaciated and worn-out Manette truly is. Although Manette often seems unaware that anyone is speaking, Defarge eventually persuades him to show Lorry the shoe he is making. He explains that he learned to make shoes “here”—i.e. in prison—but doesn’t seem to remember what he did before, or even who he is; when asked, he gives his name as “One Hundred and Five, North Tower” (44). As he looks at Lorry, however, “some long-obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence […] gradually [force] themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him” (45).Meanwhile, Lucie has been drawing closer to her father, who finally notice her. Although confused and somewhat disturbed, Manette gradually allows her to sit next to him. He then takes out a lock of hair from a pouch around his neck and compares it with his daughter’s (the hair belonged to his wife and was found on his sleeve the night he was arrested). When he muses aloud that Lucie can’t be his wife, she drops to her knees and begs him to bless her, promising to reveal who she is later: “If, when I hint to you of a Home there is before us, where I will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the remembrance of a Home long desolate […] weep for it” (48). In response, Doctor Manette sinks into his daughter’s embrace and begins crying.Once her father is calmer, Lucie asks Defarge and Lorry to arrange for their return to England. They do so and then return to fetch Manette and Lucie that evening. The doctor is largely unaware of what is happening, but clings to his daughter’s hand and takes comfort in her voice. As they prepare to board a coach, he asks for his shoemaking tools, and Madame Defarge fetches them. Lorry, Lucie, and Doctor Manette pass out of the city, with Lorry wondering all the while whether the doctor is happy to have been “dug out” (53).", "Book 1, Chapters 4-6 Analysis": "When Dickens introduces Doctor Manette, it immediately becomes clear both why he needs to be “resurrected,” and just how difficult that process will be. Manette’s long imprisonment has not only caused him to forget his past life, but also suppressed any sense of personal identity: he now knows himself only as a prisoner—and, more specifically, as a cell number. This sort of dehumanization appears again and again in A Tale of Two Cities as a psychological effect of trauma; on a much broader scale, it is partly responsible for the violent backlash against the French aristocracy because the peasantry have been treated like animals for so long that they eventually “become” animals. To underscore just how low Manette has sunk, Dickens once again uses language associated with death and burial, describing his voice as “so sunken and suppressed […] it was like a voice underground” (42).The task of bringing Manette back from his state of living death falls to his daughter Lucie, and it is here that the novel begins to develop its ideas about women and femininity. These ideas are largely a reflection of Victorian gender norms, which both idealized women and relegated them to a domestic role: the “perfect” Victorian woman was one who, by keeping house for and emotionally supporting her male relatives, instilled in them some of her own purity, selflessness, and gentleness. In this respect, Lucie is close to perfection. Her love and devotion are so powerful that they break through her father’s stupor when nothing else will; at the end of Chapter 6, Manette, although still deeply confused about where and who he is, at least recognizes that he can trust Lucie. This ability of Lucie’s to effortlessly inspire and guide those around her eventually becomes symbolized by the “golden thread” of her hair, which the narrator describes as “shining” (48) on Manette as Lucie embraces him. The idea of the golden thread also links Lucie to her double, Thérèse Defarge, who first appears in this section of the novel. Throughout A Tale of Two Cities, Madame Defarge is pictured knitting, but the superficial association of both her and Lucie with thread and cloth ultimately underscores the ways in which femininity has “gone wrong” in Madame Defarge.Finally, the scene outside the Defarges’ wine-shop introduces one of the most important motifs in the book: the association between blood and wine. This is another area in which Dickens draws heavily on Christian symbolism, but not always in straightforward ways. As Jesus’s blood, the wine traditionally drunk during communion is supposed to purify and save the drinker. In this passage, however, the starving peasantry’s thirst for the spilled wine foreshadows the bloodthirstiness of the Revolution, which will morally “stain” (32) them (at least in the short term).", "Book 2, Chapter 1 Summary: “Five Years Later\"": "The story skips ahead five years to Tellson’s Bank in London, which the narrator describes as “very dark, very ugly, very incommodious” (55). Those who work there, however, consider this part of what makes Tellson’s respectable, and strongly object to anything new; in fact, the bank doesn’t even seem to hire anyone who isn’t already old. This, the narrator says, is “on par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable, but were only the more respectable” (55).Meanwhile, Jerry Cruncher is waking up in his home in Whitefriars. When he sees his wife praying, he throws a muddy boot at her and, turning to his son, remarks, “Your mother’s a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin your father’s prosperity” (58). Mrs. Cruncher pleads that she is praying “for” her husband, but Jerry continues to scold her, saying her prayers have prevented him from earning money the last few days. He instructs his son to watch her while he himself dresses and prevents his wife from saying grace when the family sits down to breakfast.Jerry and Young Jerry walk to Tellson’s, where Jerry sits outside waiting for instructions. When his father is called in for an errand, Young Jerry takes his seat and wonders aloud why his father’s fingers are always “rusty” (61).", "Book 2, Chapter 2 Summary: “A Sight\"": "Inside Tellson’s, Jerry receives orders to go to the Old Bailey, seek out Mr. Lorry, and then wait for Lorry to give him a message. Jerry and the clerk discuss the case being tried, and Jerry, learning that the charge is treason, remarks that the punishment (quartering) is “barbarous” (62). The clerk, however, merely replies that “it is the law,” and that Jerry should “speak well” (62) of it.Jerry walks to the Old Bailey, which is “a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came into court with the prisoners” (62). The jail also contains a pillory and a whipping-post, along with crowds of people who go there for entertainment. After relaying his message, Jerry is allowed inside the court, where he chats with a fellow spectator eager to see the defendant sentenced to death. Jerry attracts the attention of Mr. Lorry, who is sitting with the defendant’s lawyers, one of whom is staring absent-mindedly at the ceiling. Both the judge and prisoner then enter; the latter is a handsome and “self-possessed” (65) young man named Charles Darnay, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiring with the French government.Darnay’s composure slips slightly as he glances towards two spectators—a young woman and her father who are later revealed to be Doctor and Lucie Manette. The crowd, which up until that point had been eager to see Darnay executed, becomes slightly more sympathetic when they see how distressed Lucie is. Meanwhile, Jerry learns from those around him that both she and her father are witnesses for the prosecution. ", "Book 2, Chapter 3 Summary: “A Disappointment\"": "The Attorney-General gives an overblown opening statement in which he appeals to the jury’s patriotism. He claims that testimony from both a former friend (John Barsad) and a former servant (Roger Cly) of Darnay will prove that Darnay is a spy, and that he was discovered with incriminating papers in his possession. When Darnay’s lawyer cross-examines these witnesses, however, holes begin to appear in their stories and credibility: Barsad is a gambler who never knew Darnay well, and Cly was once accused of theft.Next, the Attorney-General questions Mr. Lorry, who can’t say for certain whether Darnay was with him in the mail coach to Dover five years ago but confirms that he was on the boat he took back from France a few days later. The prosecutor then moves on to questioning Lucie Manette, who says Darnay helped her settle her father on board the ship and talked with her about the American Revolution, arguing that the “quarrel […] was a wrong and foolish one on England’s part” (75). Despite this, and despite the fact that she saw two men with papers talking to Darnay shortly before they set sail, Lucie’s obvious distress makes an impression on the courtroom. Finally, the Attorney-General questions Doctor Manette, who doesn’t remember the voyage from Calais but says Darnay visited them once afterwards in London.Darnay’s lawyer (Stryver) begins to cross-examine a witness who claims to have seen Darnay at a secret rendezvous but is interrupted by the other defense lawyer (Carton) throwing a note at him. Stryver reads this and, asking whether the witness can be certain of Darnay’s identity, instructs Carton to stand up; Carton and Darnay look nearly identical, “allowing for [Carton’s] appearance being careless and slovenly, if not debauched” (77).This undermines the prosecution’s case, and Stryver gives a lengthy speech arguing that Barsad and Cly were paid to plant papers on Darnay, who had to make frequent trips to France on family business. The defense’s witnesses are then questioned, and the jury begins to debate. While this is happening, Carton’s attention seems to wander away again, but he notices that Lucie is on the verge of fainting; he later inquires after her with Mr. Lorry and then passes word to Darnay that she is doing well. Darnay expects to be condemned, but Carton says he thinks the jury will acquit him. This turns out to be the case, and Lorry sends Jerry away with a message to that effect, though Jerry privately thinks he ought to send the words “recalled to life” again.", "Book 2, Chapters 1-3 Analysis": "Dickens makes extensive use of doubles throughout A Tale of Two Cities: characters, images, and ideas often come in contrasting pairs that underscore the unique qualities of each. In many cases, however, these doubles are not actually as dissimilar to one another as they first appear, and this proves to be the case with the “two cities” the novel is concerned with: London and Paris. Although Dickens clearly depicts the political and social problems facing Paris (both before and after the Revolution) as worse than those facing London, the difference is more of degree than of kind. In this section, for instance, the narrator talks extensively and critically about the complacency of the English elite and their total disinterest in making any changes to the status quo. Tellson’s, in its stodginess, is a symbol of this “precept, that ‘Whatever is, is right” (63), which later proves to be the prevailing wisdom in France as well: the French aristocracy simply refuse to see that their exploitation of the lower classes is unsustainable. The cruelty and injustice of the two country’s legal system is another point of similarity between England and France; in fact, Darnay’s trial at the Old Bailey in many ways mirrors his later trial in Paris.One of the most obvious parallels between the two trials is the role that Carton plays in saving Darnay each time. In fact, Carton and Darnay themselves are foils to one another, and are introduced to readers in the same chapter. At least initially, the striking physical resemblance between the two men (which Carton exploits to secure Darnay’s acquittal) only emphasizes how different they are in character: where Darnay is neatly dressed, Carton is “slovenly” (77); where Darnay is courteous and attentive throughout the trial, Carton seems bored by the proceedings. Darnay, in other words, appears to be a conventional literary hero—handsome, noble, and polite—while Carton seems at best pitiful and at worst immoral. Even at this early stage, however, Dickens hints that there are hidden depths to Carton, who is apparently paying more attention to his surroundings than he lets on: he not only comes up with the line of questioning that saves Darnay’s life, but is also the first person to notice that Lucie seems unwell (although he is once again “careless” and “almost insolent” (81) when he discusses the topic with Darnay).", "Book 2, Chapter 4 Summary: “Congratulatory”": "Mr. Lorry, Doctor Manette, Lucie, and Mr. Stryver gather around Darnay to congratulate him, and Darnay in turn thanks Stryver for saving his life. Although Doctor Manette is by now largely recovered from his imprisonment, he is prone to moments of “abstraction that [overcloud] him fitfully, without any apparent reason” (82), and one of these moments occurs when he looks at Darnay. Lucie pulls him out of his daze, and both the Manettes and Stryver depart.At this point, Carton appears, joking that Lorry can now safely talk to Darnay without fearing for his reputation. Lorry grows annoyed and, before leaving, scolds Carton for his laziness and disrespect. Carton, “smel[ling] of port wine” (86), then turns to Darnay and invites him to dine with him. As they settle down at a tavern, Carton asks in “his fully half-insolent manner” whether Darnay feels that he “belong[s] to this terrestrial scheme again” (87) and remarks bitterly that he himself takes little pleasure in being alive. He then presses Darnay to propose a toast to Lucie and—drinking more and more—declines to accept Darnay’s thanks for saving his life; in fact, he tells Darnay outright that he doesn’t like him. Darnay—increasingly “disconcerted” (88) by Carton’s behavior—prepares to leave. Carton stops him before he can, though, and forces Darnay to acknowledge that Carton has been drinking heavily. This, he says, is because he is a lonely and “disappointed drudge” (89). Once Darnay is gone, Carton expands on this as he talks aloud to himself: “Why should you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is nothing in you to like; you know that […] A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you what you have fallen away from and what you might have been!” (89). He eventually falls asleep at the table, and “a long winding-sheet in the candle drip[s] down upon him” (89).", "Book 2, Chapter 5 Summary: “The Jackal”": "The narrator reminds readers that his story is set in “drinking days” (89), when even “perfect gentlem[e]n” (90) drank heavily. This is true of Stryver, who is “fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative practice” (90) despite drinking whenever he settles down to go through legal papers. However, his success is also due in large part to the work Sydney Carton does for him; Stryver is not especially good at reading and understanding legal documents, but Carton is, and arranges most of Stryver’s cases for him.On this particular night, Carton leaves the tavern and heads to Stryver’s rooms. Stryver ushers him in, hands over a set of papers for Carton to go through, and both men settle in for the evening: Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in a different way: [Stryver] for the most part reclining with his hands in his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some lighter document; [Carton], with knitted brows and intent face, so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out for his glass (92). When Carton finishes “boiling down” a case in this way, he hands it over to Stryver: “At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and proceeded to offer it to him” (92).Once the evening’s work is done, the two men discuss the day’s case; Stryver congratulates Carton for his winning strategy and wonders why Carton is in a bad mood. This in turn raises the issue of Carton’s habitual apathy and gloominess; Carton says it’s simply “[his] way” (93), remarking that he used to do other boys’ work for them in school, and Stryver urges Carton to look to him as a model of purposefulness and ambition. Although Carton sarcastically reminds Stryver that he himself has had a hand in the latter’s success, he is pessimistic about his own prospects in life. Stryver changes the topic, proposing a toast to the “pretty witness,” and Carton scoffs that Lucie is a “golden-haired doll” (94). He returns home shortly afterwards, where he “thr[ows] himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed” and cries (95).", "Book 2, Chapter 6 Summary: “Hundreds of People”": "Four months after Darnay’s trial, Mr. Lorry goes to visit Doctor and Lucie Manette at their home, which is in a quiet area of London where “forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers grew, and the hawthorn blossomed” (96). The house, which also serves as an office for Manette, is peaceful and pleasant as well, largely thanks to Lucie’s skills as a housekeeper.Neither Manette nor Lucie is home, but Lucie’s maid Miss Pross is, and complains to Lorry of the “hundreds” (99) of unworthy people who stop by to visit Lucie; even Manette, in her opinion, doesn’t truly deserve his daughter. Lorry is taken aback, but admires Miss Pross for her selfless devotion to her mistress. He is concerned about Manette, however, because he noticed that he still keeps his shoemaking tools in his bedroom. Miss Pross says Manette never talks about this, or the events that led to his imprisonment. She speculates that the topic frightens him: “Not knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never feel certain of not losing himself again” (101-02). It’s clear that he often thinks about his imprisonment, because he often wakes up and paces in the middle of the night until Lucie calms him down.Manette and Lucie return, and Mr. Lorry “thank[s] his bachelor stars for having lighted in his declining years to a Home” (103). He stays for dinner and drinks, at which point Darnay also shows up and begins talking to Manette about the Tower of London: while Darnay was imprisoned there, he heard that some workmen had come across remnants of a written message in one of the cells. Manette seems alarmed by this anecdote, but quickly recovers.A thunderstorm rises as the group—now joined by Carton—sits down for tea. As they listen to the footsteps of people outside running for cover, Lucie remarks that she has “sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until [she has] made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-and-by into our lives” (106-07).Lorry leaves for home when the rain dies down, accompanied for protection by Jerry Cruncher. Lorry remarks that it’s “almost a night […] to bring the dead out of their graves” (107)—something Jerry says he has never seen. The chapter ends with a reminder of “the great crowd of people with its rush and roar, bearing down upon [the Manettes and their friends]” (108).", "Book 2, Chapters 4-6 Analysis": "Although Carton remains an enigmatic character throughout the novel, the reasons for his apparent laziness, rudeness, and apathy become clearer in these chapters. Carton is (in modern terms) an alcoholic; although the narrator notes that excessive drinking was common at the time, Carton by his own admission drinks to dull his intense disappointment with life. This in turn suggests that Carton also suffers from what we’d now call depression. Despite (or perhaps because of) his deep self-disgust, Carton feels completely incapable of changing himself or his life for the better; the fact that he has worked hard his entire life for the benefit of others without ever advancing himself strongly suggests that he views himself as unworthy of “his own help and his own happiness” (95). The fact that this kind of imprisonment (as opposed to, for example, Doctor Manette’s) is basically of Carton’s own making doesn’t make it any less confining, since, as the narrator noted earlier in the novel, each individual person is ultimately isolated within his own “individuality” (15).A Tale of Two Cities does ultimately suggest that there is a way around this isolation (and around Carton’s isolation in particular), which is where Carton’s feelings for Lucie come in. Although Carton mocks Stryver’s appreciation of Lucie’s beauty, he clearly was affected by her as well; when Darnay leaves him alone in the tavern, Carton bitterly laments that Lucie would never have “commiserated” (89)with him if he had had been the one on trial. Like Darnay himself, who reminds Carton of “what [he has] fallen away from” (89), Lucie’s goodness and purity speak to Carton’s nobler, idealistic side. Eventually, Carton’s love for Lucie (or perhaps what she represents) is what will redeem him.Chapter 6, meanwhile, helps clarify why Lucie inspires this kind of devotion. When Lorry visits the Manettes’ home, he is deeply impressed by her ability to create an atmosphere of tranquility and happiness: Simple as the furniture was, it was set off by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy, that its effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours, the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in themselves, and so expressive of their origination, that, as Mr. Lorry stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask, with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time, whether he approved? (97-98). Lorry’s sense that Lucie’s own character is imprinted on her surroundings helps explain why Dickens lingers on her skills as a housekeeper; by infusing everything around her with her own goodness, Lucie creates a refuge from the violence and oppression of the outside world. However, this kind of domestic bliss can’t entirely ignore the world beyond it. In Chapter 6, the narrator draws attention to the fact that the Manettes’ house is situated in “a wonderful corner for echoes” (102), and Lucie herself associates the sound of people on the street outside with the people she will cross paths with later in life. The footsteps that appear throughout the novel are a warning of the ways in which fate and society can encroach on peaceful family life. ", "Book 2, Chapter 7 Summary: “Monsieur the Marquis in Town”": "A French nobleman the narrator refers to as “Monseigneur” drinks his morning hot chocolate—a process that takes multiple attendants, “all four a-blaze with gorgeous decoration, and the Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket” (108).While this is going on, the narrator describes Monseigneur and the decadent society he belongs to. Despite being a person of great political importance, Monseigneur “ha[s] one truly noble idea of general public business, which was, to let everything go in its own way; [and] of particular public business, [he has] the other truly noble idea that it must all go his way—tend to his own power and pocket” (109). His peers share this total disinterest in the needs of the country at large; like Monseigneur, they are mostly concerned with their own entertainment, and are constantly “dressed for a Fancy Ball that was never to leave off” (112). Overall, Monseigneur and the guests currently in his home are dangerously cut off from what the narrator calls “reality”—while doctors devise “dainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed” (110), the lower classes are starving.After finishing his chocolate, Monseigneur receives his many guests and admirers. One of these people—“a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and with a face like a fine mask” (113)—curses Monseigneur as he leaves the house. As he gets into his carriage, he takes pleasure in “see[ing] the common people dispersed before his horses, and often barely escaping from being run down” (113). Eventually, the carriage does strike someone and is forced to a halt, at which point the passenger (the Marquis) sees a man “howling” (114) over his dead child’s body. Scolding the man for his negligence, the Marquis tosses him a coin. In the meantime, Defarge arrives and attempts to lead the father—Gaspard—away. As the Marquis gets back in his carriage, someone throws the coin back at him.The Marquis demands to know who threw the coin, but the people are by and large too frightened to say anything; in fact, the only one who even dares to look at him is Madame Defarge, who stands beside Gaspard knitting. Giving up, the Marquis drives on, and the crowd slowly disperses, leaving only Madame Defarge behind, still knitting.", "Book 2, Chapter 8 Summary: “Monsieur the Marquis in the Country”": "The Marquis approaches his chateau, which sits in an impoverished stretch of countryside: Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly—a dejected disposition to give up, and wither away (118). The sun is setting, and momentarily shades the Marquis’s hands and face red. The carriage stops when it reaches the Marquis’s town. The villagers here are worn-out and desperate, in part because of the many taxes levied on them, and their “submissive faces […] droop before him” (119). The Marquis asks for one particular man, whom his carriage passed along the road, to be brought forward. The man is a mender of roads, and he explains that he was staring at the Marquis’s carriage because a man was hanging onto its underside. The Marquis rudely questions the mender of roads about this man, and instructs the town’s postmaster, Monsieur Gabelle, to check the area where the man supposedly jumped off.Meanwhile, the Marquis’s carriage travels on, but is stopped as it passes a cemetery by a woman praying there; she explains that her husband recently died of “want,” and begs for a “morsel of stone or wood” (122) to mark his grave, so that she herself can be buried next to him in time. The Marquis’s servants push her away, and the carriage continues on to the chateau, where the Marquis asks if “Monsieur Charles” (123) has arrived.", "Book 2, Chapter 9 Summary: “The Gorgon’s Head”": "When the Marquis arrives at his chateau—a “stony business altogether” (123)—he goes directly to his rooms and sits down to dinner, which has been set for two in expectation of his nephew’s arrival. At one point, the Marquis thinks he sees something outside the window; however, when the servant pulls back the blinds, nothing is there. Shortly afterwards, the Marquis’s nephew arrives: it is Charles Darnay. He explains that his visit was delayed by “various business” (126)—that is, his trial for treason—and implies that his uncle was involved in the charges against him; in fact, Darnay says, he would likely be in a French prison at this moment if the Marquis weren’t out of favor at court. The Marquis doesn’t explicitly confirm any of this, but he does complain that the French aristocracy no longer has the unlimited power it used to: “In the next room (my bedroom), one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter” (127). When Darnay laments that these actions have earned them the hatred of the peasantry, the Marquis is pleased: “Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear and slavery […] will keep the dogs obedient to the whip” (128).Darnay refuses to be put off and says that he is determined to carry out his mother’s final wishes by making amends for the wrong his family has done. To that end, he says he “renounces” (129) both France and his inheritance, which he intends to return to the French people; meanwhile, he will work to support himself. The Marquis mocks Darnay’s plans to live in England and asks whether he has met “a doctor” and “his daughter” who have sought “refuge” (131) there. When Darnay says that he has, the Marquis smiles strangely.Both Darnay and the Marquis retire to bed. As the sun rises the next morning, “the water of the château fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces crimsoned” (132). The village and the chateau slowly wake up and begin to go about their daily routines, but then something interrupts them: there is a commotion in the chateau, a crowd gathers in town, and Gabelle leaves the village on urgent business. This, the narrator says, is because “there was one stone face too many, up at the château” (134).The Marquis was stabbed to death during the night, and the killer left a note reading: “Drive him fast to his tomb. This, from Jacques” (134).", "Book 2, Chapters 7-9 Analysis": "More than any other part of A Tale of Two Cities, these three chapters demonstrate why revolution becomes unavoidable in France, and why it is so bloody when it happens. Monseigneur is less a character than a stand-in for the entire Ancien Régime, and as Dickens depicts him, he is at best indifferent to the plight of the lower classes. To Monseigneur and the rest of his class, the French peasantry (and France itself) are simply fuel to burn in the pursuit of their own pleasure. Dickens underscores this point by repeatedly drawing on images of consumption, predation, and even cannibalism. Monseigneur, for instance, is “by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing France” (108). Unbeknownst to the aristocracy themselves, however, their position is increasingly precarious. In some sense, Monseigneur and his peers are flouting basic laws of nature (or, as the narrator puts it, “reality”): For the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could achiever, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere […] they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business—if that could’ve been anybody’s business, at the house of Monseigneur (110).By contrast, the Marquis actually is aware of the depth of popular hatred but chooses to do nothing about it. This is because, where others simply ignore the suffering of the French peasantry, the Marquis actively takes pleasure in it; he enjoys terrorizing the lower classes with his reckless driving, and tells Darnay that the “dark deference of fear and slavery” he complains of is “a compliment […] to the grandeur of the family” (128). The sadism the Marquis displays in this chapter—and, in particular, the satisfaction he takes in recounting the “poniard[ing]” (128) of the peasant father—foreshadows the eventual revelation that as a young man he raped Madame Defarge’s elder sister and killed her brother. The Marquis’s murder, meanwhile, is a preview of the fate in store for the rest of the French aristocracy. Dickens heavily implies that the Marquis dies as a direct consequence of the death of the boy he ran over; although it’s not yet clear that the murderer is in fact Gaspard, the two deaths are linked by the red sunlight that first appears to stain the Marquis’s hands with blood and then stains the fountain on the morning after his death. This “payback\" is especially significant given that the Marquis quite literally tried to pay his way out of responsibility for the boy’s death—a gesture that appears particularly insulting and inadequate in the context of a novel about redemption (that is, buying back or paying off a spiritual debt). The question of what kind of “payment” can make up for the Evrémonde family’s sins is one that becomes pressing during Darnay’s trial in revolutionary France.", "Book 2, Chapter 10 Summary: “Two Promises”": "Twelve months after his uncle’s murder, Darnay has successfully established himself as a French tutor. Although he has been in love with Lucie since his trial, however, he has hesitated to speak to her about it. Instead, he chooses to visit Doctor Manette when he knows Lucie will be out.Manette is visibly pained as Darnay confesses his love for Lucie, although he reassures Darnay that he doesn’t doubt his sincerity or selflessness. He also realizes that Darnay hasn’t spoken to Lucie out of respect for him, which Darnay confirms, noting that the two share a particularly strong bond because of Manette’s long imprisonment. He assures him, however, that he would not separate Lucie from her father if he married her; he has still not decided whether (or if) he will tell Lucie how he feels, but he asks Doctor Manette to “bear testimony to what [he has] said” (140) if Lucie ever confesses that she herself is in love. Manette promises that he will, and assures Darnay that “any fancies, any reasons any apprehensions, anything whatsoever, new or old, against the man [Lucie] really loved—the direct responsibility not lying on his head—they should all be obliterated for her sake” (141).Darnay thanks Manette and says he wishes to repay him by revealing his true name and history. Manette, however, grows alarmed and makes Darnay swear not to tell him until the morning of his wedding to Lucie. Darnay promises this and leaves. Later that evening, Lucie comes home to find her father working at his shoemaking bench and helps calm him down and put him to bed. ", "Book 2, Chapter 11 Summary: “A Companion Picture”": "Early the next morning, Carton and Stryver are in the latter’s rooms after a long night of work. As Carton prepares another bowl of punch, Stryver announces that he plans on marrying, though he doesn’t expect an “insensible dog” (143) like Carton to understand this. Carton sarcastically retorts that Stryver is a “sensitive and poetical spirit” (143), which leads Stryver to berate Carton for not doing more to make himself “agreeable” (144) when they visit Doctor Manette’s house. Carton ignores this and continues to take jabs at Stryver until the latter comes to the point, which is that he hopes to marry Lucie: “She is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind to please myself […] She will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man, and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her, but she is worthy of good fortune” (145).Stryver expects Carton will disapprove of this match, since he once spoke of Lucie in “slighting terms” (145). Carton, however, says little and continues to drink punch. Stryver therefore explains that while he himself wants to marry in order to “have a home when he feels inclined to go to it,” Carton is “in a bad way” and should think about marrying a woman with some money who can act as a “nurse” (146). Carton simply says he will think about it.", "Book 2, Chapter 12 Summary: “The Fellow of Delicacy”": "Feeling certain of the “strength of his case” (147), Stryver goes to visit the Manettes. As he passes by Tellson’s, he decides to stop in and explain his intentions to Mr. Lorry. To his surprise, however, Lorry seems doubtful about his plan to marry Lucie. Growing irritated, Stryver asks whether he isn’t “eligible,” “prosperous,” and “advancing” (150), and Lorry admits that he is; he says, however, that in his opinion Stryver oughtn’t to go through with his proposal unless he has some reason to think it will be accepted. Stryver complains that he has just listed several reasons and says that Lorry must consider Lucie a “mincing Fool” (151) if he thinks she would reject him. Lorry grows angry next, saying he won’t hear Lucie spoken of disrespectfully. However, in an effort to avoid “pain” (152) on all sides, Lorry offers to speak to the Manettes himself and report to Stryver later that day, and Stryver agrees.Realizing that Lorry “would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than moral certainty” (153), Stryver returns home with no intention of pursuing Lucie further. In fact, he is surprised when Lorry shows up later that day to tell him that his earlier advice was correct. In response, Stryver announces that was never committed to proposing anyway, and merely pities Lucie and her father’s loss: In an unselfish aspect, I am sorry that the thing has been dropped, because it would have been a good thing for others in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view (154). He then ushers a stunned Mr. Lorry out the door.", "Book 2, Chapter 13 Summary: “The Fellow of No Delicacy”": "Meanwhile, Carton has been visiting the Manettes’ often: “When he cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing, which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely pierced by the light within him” (155). He seems drawn to the house and spends much of his time walking up and down the streets nearby. Sometime after Stryver’s failed proposal, Carton stops by the house to visit Lucie.Although Lucie isn’t entirely comfortable with Carton, she expresses concern for his health and—when he says his life is “not conducive to health” (155)—questions why he doesn’t change it. To her surprise, Carton begins to cry, explaining that he “will never be better than [he is]” and that he will simply “sink lower” (156). He asks her, however, to think of him as “one who died young” and to listen to what he has to say: he is glad that Lucie could never return his feelings for her because marrying him would simply “blight” and “disgrace” (156) her as well. Simply knowing her, however, has touched him profoundly; he describes her as “the last dream of [his] soul” and explains that if anything could have “reclaimed” (157) him, it would have been Lucie. Throughout Carton’s speech, Lucie tries to persuade him not to give up on himself so easily and begs to know how she can use her “influence” (157) with him for good. Carton denies that this is possible, and asks that she simply “let [him] believe […] that the last confidence of [his] life was reposed in [her] pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there alone, and will be shared by no one” (158). Lucie promises to keep Carton’s declaration a secret, and Carton promises never to bring up the subject again, wishing her an otherwise “light and happy” (158) life and assuring her he isn’t worthy of sorrow. He does, however, make one final request before he leaves: that Lucie will believe in the sincerity of his feelings, and of his sincerity when he says that he would “give his life, to keep a life [she] love[s] beside [her]” (159).", "Book 2, Chapters 10-13 Analysis": "As it becomes clearer that Carton isn’t so dissimilar to Darnay as he initially appears, Stryver emerges as Carton’s true opposite. This is nowhere more obvious than in Dickens’s juxtaposition of the two men’s declarations of love. When Stryver announces his plan to marry Lucie, he is thinking almost entirely of himself; he wants a wife to return home to—although only “when he feels inclined” (146)—and he believes that Lucie is the right sort of wife for him—a “charming creature” (145) who will reflect well on Stryver. What’s more, he can’t fathom the idea that Lucie might turn him down, and when he realizes that she is likely to do just that, he immediately rearranges the narrative surrounding his proposal to one that places him in the best possible light: “Having supposed that there was sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is done” (153-54).Carton, by contrast, doesn’t ask Lucie for anything; in fact, he declares his love for her by offering to sacrifice his life on her behalf. Given that Carton views himself and his life in such bleak terms, this may not initially seem like much of a sacrifice. By the end of the novel, however, it’s clear that Carton’s offer isn’t a suicidal gesture, but just the opposite. Throughout his conversation with Lucie, Carton makes it clear that he considers his current state a form of death; he describes himself, for instance, as a “heap of ashes” that Lucie momentarily brought back to life but that will soon “[burn] away” (157) again. By losing his life Carton will find the precise things he lacks throughout the rest of the novel: a sense of purpose, a pathway out of his isolation, and, symbolically, life itself.Meanwhile, Manette is preparing to make a different kind of sacrifice on his daughter’s behalf. Dickens doesn’t reveal the full story of Manette’s imprisonment until the final chapters of the novel, but he hints at it during Manette’s conversation with Darnay: Manette senses that he may have some “fancies” (141) about Darnay that Darnay himself doesn’t deserve. As it turns out, this is because it was Darnay’s uncle and father who were behind Manette’s arrest. Despite suspecting who Darnay is, however, Manette refuses to stand in the way of Lucie’s happiness.", "Book 2, Chapter 14 Summary: “The Honest Tradesman”": "Jerry Cruncher and his son are sitting outside Tellson’s when a “dingy” funeral procession passes by, accompanied by shouts of “Spies!” (161). The sight excites both of them, and Jerry learns from one of the onlookers that the dead man is Roger Cly. Meanwhile, the crowd grows more agitated, eventually forcing the sole mourner out of the coach and climbing aboard it themselves: “Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it” (162). After they have buried Cly “to their own satisfaction,” the crowd begins to harass passers-by before “transition[ing] to the sport of window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses” (164). Cruncher, who had joined the funeral procession, remains in the cemetery after the rest of the crowd disperses. Musing that Cly was “a young ‘un and a straight made ‘un,” he stops at a doctor on his way back to Tellson’s (164).Over tea that evening, Jerry tells his wife that he is going out “fishing” that night and that he will know she has been praying if his “wenturs goes wrong” (165). He also warns her against playing any “games” the next day by refusing to eat or drink whatever he “as a honest tradesman, succeed[s] in providing” (166).Cruncher had earlier told his son he couldn’t come with him that evening, but Young Jerry simply pretends to be sleeping until his father leaves. He then follows his father as he joins two other men and climbs over an iron gate into a churchyard. Here, the men “fish” by digging up a coffin, frightening Young Jerry so much that he runs home.The next morning, Young Jerry wakes up to see his father beating his mother for undermining “business” (169). After a meager breakfast, Cruncher and his son go to work at Tellson’s. On the way, Young Jerry asks his father what a “Resurrection-Man” is, and Cruncher responds that it’s a “tradesman” dealing in a “branch of Scientific goods” (170), which he then admits are bodies. Young Jerry says that this is what he wants to do when he grows up, and Cruncher, feeling “soothed,” advises him to “dewelop [his] talents” (170).", "Book 2, Chapter 15 Summary: “Knitting”": "For several days, the Defarges’ wine-shop has been unusually busy with customers who don’t purchase anything, but instead “[listen] and [whisper] and sl[i]nk about” (171). Monsieur Defarge has been out most of the time, but on this particular day he returns at noon, accompanied by the mender of roads. He introduces the man to his wife as “Jacques” and takes him to the garret where Doctor Manette once stayed. There, they find several men from the wine-shop (who are also the men Defarge once showed Doctor Manette to).Defarge introduces the mender of roads to “Jacques One,” “Jacques Two,” and “Jacques Three,” and the mender tells the story of how he saw the Marquis’s murder hanging on to the underside of his carriage. As the other men question him, it emerges that the murderer was caught several months later, and that the mender saw him being escorted by guards to the town prison. The following day, when the mender passed by, he saw the man “high up, behind the bars of a lofty iron cage, bloody and dusty” (175). The man remained up there for days, and rumors arose that a petition was being arranged, since the man—Gaspard—was only acting to avenge his child. The listening Jacques confirm that Defarge approached the King with this petition, but say he was beaten back by guards.Resuming his story, the mender says that rumors next began to circulate about the gruesome ways in which Gaspard might be executed. Ultimately, however, a gallows is constructed over the village fountain, and Gaspard is “left hanging, poisoning the water” (178).Defarge dismisses the mender of roads and turns to the other men. Together, they decide that the Marquis’s family should be “registered” (179) in Madame Defarge’s knitting, which is a record of those marked for execution. The men express concern about the mender, who wants to see the King and Queen while in Paris. Defarge, however, isn’t worried about this: “Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish him to bring it down one day” (179). In fact, he and his wife take the mender to Versailles, where he cheers excitedly for the royals. Monsieur and Madame Defarge congratulate him on this, saying that he “make[s] these fools believe that it will last for ever” (181) and that he will do the right thing when the time comes.", "Book 2, Chapter 16 Summary: “Still Knitting”": "The mender of roads returns to his village, and the Defarges chat as they return to their wine-shop. Monsieur Defarge has learned that John Barsad has been sent to spy in their neighborhood, and Madame Defarge says she will record him in her knitting. Noticing her husband seems downcast, Madame Defarge assures him that rebellions like the one they have planned are necessarily long in the making, but that the payoff will be worthwhile even if they themselves don’t live to see it: “I believe, with all my soul, that we shall see the triumph. But even if not, even if I knew certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I would—” There madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed” (186).The following day, Madame Defarge is manning the wine-shop when Barsad enters. Recognizing him from her husband’s description, she pins a rose to her hair—a signal for other customers in the shop to leave or stop talking. Barsad fishes for incriminating information by feigning sympathy for the “oppressed” (188) people of France and for Gaspard in particular. Madame Defarge, however, says that she and her husband are too busy trying to survive to concern themselves with other people’s problems. When Defarge enters, Barsad calls him “Jacques,” but Defarge doesn’t take the bait, merely saying his name is “Ernest.”Barsad continues talking, turning the conversation to the Defarges’ relationship with Doctor Manette. Learning that they have not been in touch with Manette recently, Barsad reveals that Lucie is planning to marry the murdered Marquis’s nephew. Defarge is unable to entirely conceal his surprise and discomfort, and, when Barsad has left, discusses the topic with his wife: Darnay’s name is among those recorded in Madame Defarge’s knitting, and Defarge expresses hope that “Destiny will keep [Lucie’s] husband out of France” (191).Madame Defarge removes the rose from her headdress, and activity in the wine-shop resumes. As evening falls, Madame Defarge visits and chats with several groups of women, all of whom are knitting; meanwhile: “Another darkness [is] closing in as surely, when the church bells, [now] ringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be melted into thundering cannon” (194).", "Book 2, Chapters 14-16 Analysis": "Throughout A Tale of Two Cities, the narrator associates Madame Defarge’s knitting with the workings of destiny; he describes her at one point, for instance, as “knitt[ing] on with the steadfastness of Fate” (117). The image is in part an allusion to the Moirai—Greek goddesses who determined the course and span of human lives by spinning, measuring, and cutting thread. In these chapters, however, it becomes clear that there is also a more concrete reason for the symbolism surrounding Madame Defarge’s knitting: she encodes the names (and therefore the fates) of those who are marked for death under the future French Republic.Once again, then, Dickens depicts the Revolution as a foregone conclusion. As Madame Defarge tells her husband: “Although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it is always advancing” (185). In other words, the “rage and discontent” of the oppressed peasantry are so unstoppable a historical force that they function as destiny, which to Madame Defarge is a source of consolation. There are already hints, however, that the Revolution may not necessarily usher in a more just social order.Defarge’s suggestion that the aristocrats are the peasantry’s “natural prey” (179) is especially ominous, given how often the narrator has previously depicted the oppression of the peasantry through images of predators and prey. In fact, Madame Defarge is quite open about the fact that she is seeking “vengeance and retribution” (185)—that is, proportional payback for the wrongs inflicted on her and her family. Defarge’s comment about Darnay suggests that his views are more moderate, but it’s increasingly clear that his wife wields the real power in the relationship; throughout the couple’s conversation with Barsad, Madame Defarge subtly provides her husband with instructions, brushing his elbow at one point to tell him “that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity” (190).In contrast to the dark scenes in Paris, the chapter involving Jerry Cruncher’s grave-robbing mostly functions as comic relief. With that said, it does eventually prove relevant to the plot, and it has immediate significance in terms of the novel’s central themes. In much the same way that Cruncher’s grave-robbing parodies the idea of resurrection, the vengeful crowd that takes over Cly’s funeral procession foreshadows (in a slightly more lighthearted form) the crowds that later form around the guillotine. Once again, then, Dickens suggests that the differences between London and Paris aren’t as great as they might seem.", "Book 2, Chapter 17 Summary: “One Night”": "The night before her marriage to Darnay, Lucie sits at home with her father. She presses him on whether he truly feels comfortable with her marrying, reassuring him that “no new affections […] will ever interpose between [them]” (195). Manette in turn tells his daughter that he would not be happy knowing that he stood between Lucie and the life she deserves. Pointing to the moon, he describes how he used to stare at it in prison, mentally drawing lines across it to occupy himself. His thoughts also turned often to his wife and child, wondering whether they were alive and what the future held in store for them: “I have cast up the years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married to a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from the remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a blank” (196). Lucie grows distressed, but her father continues, explaining that at other times he imagined his grown daughter coming to his cell and leading him out of it to a home where his memory is respected and passed on to his descendants. When Lucie says that she hopes she is “that child” (196), Manette blesses her, and assures her that his happiness far exceeds anything he imagined while in prison.Manette and Lucie then have dinner with Miss Pross. Late that night, Lucie wakes up and visits her father’s room, where she finds him sleeping peacefully, and says a prayer over him.", "Book 2, Chapter 18 Summary: “Nine Days”": "On the morning of the wedding, Manette and Darnay speak privately together while Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross admire Lucie. Miss Pross cries tears of joy, and Lorry marvels at all that has happened since he first brought Lucie to England. He also remarks that the marriage makes him think of all the opportunities he himself has missed in life, causing Miss Pross to retort that he was “a bachelor in [his] cradle” (200). Finally, Lorry assures Lucie that he and Miss Pross will look after her father for the first two weeks of her marriage, after which Manette will join the couple on their honeymoon.The ceremony and wedding breakfast go smoothly, and Manette sees his daughter and son-in-law off. He had looked “deadly pale” (201) after his earlier meeting with Darnay, however, and as soon as the newlyweds are gone, he grows more distracted and agitated. Lorry and Miss Pross decide to give him space to recover, but when Lorry stops by after work later that day, Miss Pross anxiously reports that Manette has taken up his shoemaking once again and doesn’t recognize her.Lorry visits Manette but is also unable to rouse him. He and Miss Pross decide to keep Manette’s state a secret from both Lucie and his patients, saying simply that he is unwell. In the meantime, Lorry takes time off from Tellson’s to sit with Manette in “silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen” (204). He and Miss Pross take turns speaking gently to Manette of familiar people and things and offer opportunities to leave the room if he wants to. Although Manette sometimes shows interest in what’s going on around him, he persists in his shoemaking for nine days, by which point “the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first, was growing dreadfully skillful, and […] had never been so intent on his work” (205).", "Book 2, Chapter 19 Summary: “An Opinion”": "On the morning of the tenth day, Lorry visits Manette’s room and finds him calmly reading. Together with Miss Pross, he decides not to bring up Manette’s episode, and the household goes about its normal morning routine. After breakfast, however, Lorry decides to seek Manette’s professional advice on the situation; he doesn’t refer to Manette by name but describes a “curious case” involving an “old and prolonged shock […] to the affections, the feelings, […] the mind” (207). After apparently recovering, this “particularly dear friend” (207) of Lorry’s suddenly relapsed for nine days. Under the guise of talking someone else, Manette questions Lorry about the case, and learns that Lucie hasn’t been told anything.Lorry then comes to the point, and asks Manette what caused the relapse, whether it might happen again, and what could be done to prevent it. Manette suggests that there was “a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady” (209). He also says, however, that he doesn’t think another relapse is likely, since it is only one particular topic that brings the episodes on. He therefore rejects Lorry’s idea that “overwork” (210) might have contributed to the problem; in fact, he says, the distraction work provides likely prevents worse episodes from occurring. Reluctantly, however, he does admit that it may be best to remove the shoemaking tools (or, as Lorry puts it, the “blacksmith’s forge”) from his home. He asks, however, that this not be done while he is present.That being the case, Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross wait for Doctor Manette to join Lucie and Darnay. They then burn or bury all the Doctor’s shoemaking tools: “In a mysterious and guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker’s bench to pieces, while Miss press held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder” (212). ", "Book 2, Chapter 20 Summary: “A Plea”": "As soon as the newlyweds return to London, Carton pays Darnay a visit. He tells Darnay that he wishes to be something like friends and expresses regret for a “drunken occasion” when he “was insufferable about liking [Darnay], and not liking [him]” (215). Darnay politely tries to wave these admissions aside, but, seeing how earnest Carton is, finally assures him that he only feels gratitude towards him for saving his life. Carton in turn dismisses this, calling it “mere professional claptrap,” and then comes to his point: although he knows he is “incapable of all the higher and better flights of men” (215), he wants to be allowed to visit the Darnays sometimes. He promises he will not “abuse the permission,” and says that the Darnays should consider him “an useless […] piece of furniture, tolerated for its old service and taken no notice of” (216). Darnay agrees, and Carton leaves.At dinner that day, Darnay begins to talk about Carton’s “carelessness and recklessness” (216) while recounting their earlier conversation. Later that night, he notices that Lucie seems troubled, and she eventually tells her husband that she wishes Darnay would speak more kindly of Carton: “I would ask you to believe that he has a heart he very, very, seldom reveals, and that there are deep wounds in it” (217). She further explains that although Carton may never live up to his full potential, “he is capable of good things, gentle things, even magnanimous things” (217) and should be pitied rather than condemned. Darnay is surprised but regrets any pain he has caused Carton and agrees to do as Lucie asks.", "Book 2, Chapters 17-20 Analysis": "Doctor Manette’s relapse casts a pall over the otherwise happy moment of Lucie and Darnay’s wedding. It’s also a reminder that Manette’s “resurrection” is incomplete, and that the personality of the “shoemaker” that he developed in prison is always waiting to reemerge. In a sense, Manette has traded physical imprisonment for mental imprisonment, and although he eventually extricates himself from the episode, he makes it clear that there is no easy way out of these states; when Lorry asks whether he wouldn’t “be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart the that secret brooding to any one, when it is on him,” Manette replies that reaching outside of himself in those moments is “next to impossible” (209).In this respect, Manette has something in common with Carton, who is similarly isolated and trapped inside his own mind. Carton, however, so rarely manages to emerge from the “cloud of caring for nothing, which overshadow[s] him” (155), that Darnay is “astounded” (217) to learn that Carton has any kind of inner life beyond what he shows in public. In fact, it’s telling that even Lucie, who has seen Carton at his best, says she “fear[s] he is not to be reclaimed” (217). Ultimately, of course, Carton is not only “reclaimed” but greatly surpasses any expectations anyone had of him, proving once again that “every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other” (14).Another point of similarity between Carton and Manette is the relationship of each man to Lucie. Dickens insists throughout the novel that it is only through Lucie’s influence that Manette has managed to (mostly) recover, and it is that same “sweet compassion” (156) that inspires Carton to make the sacrifice that redeems him. It’s noteworthy, then, that Manette’s account of his thoughts in prison in many ways echoes what Carton has previously said about his “name, and faults, and miseries” being “gently carried in [Lucie’s] heart” (158). Manette describes imagining his then unknown daughter living in a home “full of her loving remembrance of her lost father […] Her life was active, cheerful, cheerful, and useful; but my poor history pervaded it all” (197). This, then, is another way in which Lucie’s goodness redeems those around her: by transforming their suffering into another instance of her compassion.", "Book 2, Chapter 21 Summary: “Echoing Footsteps”": "Several years pass, and Lucie measures the changes in her life in the echoing footsteps around her house. She imagines, for instance, she can now hear the footsteps of her young daughter Lucie, as well as “the rustling of an Angel’s wings” (219)—a son that died young. Meanwhile, Lucie is “ever busily winding the golden thread that [binds] them all together, weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all their lives” (218). Her father, for instance, remarks that she has actually become more attentive to him since marrying, and Darnay is amazed by his wife’s ability to be “everything to all of [them]” (221).Carton pays rare visits to the Darnays, where he quickly becomes a favorite of little Lucie’s. Lorry is still friends with the family as well and visits them one evening when the Darnays’ daughter is roughly six. Having just come from Tellson’s, Lorry complains that many of their French customers are anxious to have their property transferred to England; although he says that this is “unreasonable” (221), he is flustered and remarks that the footsteps that night “are very numerous and very loud” (222).Meanwhile, in Paris, the footsteps are “headlong, mad, and dangerous” (222). A massive, armed crowd has gathered around the Defarges’ wine-shop, and Defarge is issuing orders. Together with his wife, who is armed herself, Defarge leads the charge to the Bastille. The assault on the prison goes on for hours, with both women and men taking part: “Flashing weapons, blazing torches, smoking wagon-loads of wet straw, hard work at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys, execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the furious sounding of the living sea [of people]” (224). At last, those inside the Bastille surrender, and the crowd surges in to free the prisoners.During this commotion, Defarge pulls a prison guard aside and asks him to take him to Manette’s old cell. Once there, Defarge discovers that Manette had scratched his initials and a calendar on the wall; he then searches the rest of the cell, tearing apart the bed and table and groping around in the chimney.Back outside, Defarge finds that the governor of the Bastille has been captured. The crowd kills him, Madame Defarge cuts off his head, and the rebels hoist his body up where a lamp once hung. Meanwhile, the heads of the prison guards are placed on pikes, and the former prisoners are “carried over head; all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the Last Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits” (229). ", "Book 2, Chapter 22 Summary: “The Sea Still Rises”": "A week after the storming of the Bastille, Madame Defarge is sitting in the wine-shop “contemplating” (230) the change that has taken place in Saint Antoine: There were several knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress […] Every lean bare arm, that had been without work before, had this work always read for it now, that it could strike. The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that they could tear (230-31).Defarge enters the shop and announces that a man named Foulon, who once said that the lower classes could eat grass, has been captured after trying to fake his own death. Defarge and Madame Defarge rally the neighborhood and set off for the place where Foulon is being held prisoner; the women in particular, led by Madame Defarge and her friend “the Vengeance” are eager to punish Foulon for the suffering he has caused their families.The crowd arrives at the Hôtel de Ville, cheering at the sight of Foulon tied up. After taunting him, they stuff his mouth full of grass and hang him, afterwards placing his head on a pike. Not long afterwards, the crowd manages to seize and execute Foulon’s son-in-law, who was being escorted to Paris under guard. Full of optimism, the people then return to their “scanty and insufficient suppers” together: “Fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children; and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and hoped” (235). Madame Defarge tells her husband that the revolution has nearly arrived. ", "Book 2, Chapter 23 Summary: “Fire Rises”": "The lands near the Marquis’s chateau are increasingly depleted, and many of the guards and soldiers posted at the local prison are gone. In fact, the French aristocracy has begun to flee the country: The last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable (236).However, the mender of roads is still at work in the area and is approached one day by a “shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that [are] clumsy […] steeped in the mud and dust of many highways” (237). They greet one another as “Jacques” and discuss an unspecified event that will take place that night; the mender provides the traveler with directions and agrees to wake him from his nap at sunset.That evening, the mender returns home to the village, where a crowd has gathered “looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only” (239). As the night deepens, lights appear in the chateau: a group of men has set the building on fire. A messenger from the chateau goes to fetch help at the prison, but the soldiers refuse to help. Meanwhile, the villager goes to Gabelle’s house, pounding on the door and placing “an ill-omened lamp […] before his posting-house gate” (242) in preparation for stringing Gabelle himself up. Gabelle manages to survive the night, but similar scenes are playing out across the rest of France, sometimes ending in victory for the rebels and sometimes in victory for the government’s forces: “But the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West, North, and South, be that as it would; and whosever hung, fire burned” (242). ", "Book 2, Chapter 24 Summary: “Drawn to the Loadstone Rock”": "Three years pass, and England watches anxiously as the revolution in France grows: by the summer of 1792, Louis XVI has been deposed, and many aristocrats have fled. Once in England, they often gather at Tellson’s, since the bank has a French branch.In mid-August, Darnay visits Tellson’s and learns that Lorry is traveling to Paris that night to safeguard the bank’s business there. Lorry, however, feels certain that his age and nationality will protect him, and in any case plans to take Jerry Cruncher with him as a bodyguard. As Darnay and Lorry talk, the French aristocrats around them discuss “extravagant plots […] for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself” (247).A message addressed to “Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evrémonde” (247) interrupts these conversations; the name is Darnay’s, but he hasn’t told it to anyone but Doctor Manette. The gathered nobles explain to Lorry that the prior Marquis’s nephew abandoned his title and inheritance out of sympathy with the “new doctrines” (248). Privately frustrated with the nobles’ disdainful tone, Darnay says he knows the addressee and offers to deliver the message. Once out of sight, he opens it: it is from Gabelle, who has been arrested for acting on behalf of an “emigrant” (250)—that is, Darnay, who had instructed him to stop collecting taxes and rent from the villagers. He therefore asks Darnay to come to France and speak on his behalf.Darnay is immediately overwhelmed by guilt; he feels responsible for Gabelle, and fears he was so anxious to cut ties with his family that he didn’t arrange matters in France properly. He also judges himself for having watched the Revolution unfold in France without intervening. Sure that his past actions on behalf of the peasantry will protect him, Darnay decides he must return to France: “The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he struck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger” (252). Darnay decides not to anyone of his decision until he has left. Instead, he writes letters to Lucie and Doctor Manette, explaining why he has left and asking Manette to take care of the family in his absence. After a long day during which he struggles not to confide in his wife, Darnay leaves these letters to a porter for safekeeping and rides to Dover.", "Book 2, Chapters 21-24 Analysis": "As events in France reach a crisis point, Dickens leans even more into the idea that they are inevitable. His descriptions of the storming of the Bastille, for instance, draw heavily on imagery of tides and currents: “So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing [Defarge] on, that even to draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been struggling in the surf of the South Sea, until he was landed in the outer court-yard of the Bastille” (224-225). The comparison of the rebel crowds to an ocean implies that the people’s actions are not only unstoppable but also in some sense natural—that is, the logical consequence of the system they’re reacting to. The idea that the Revolution is fated recurs in this section of the novel; the motif of echoing footsteps, for example, implies the approach of an unavoidable future, and Darnay is “drawn” back to France as if against his own will.One consequence of this view of the Revolution is that it leaves little room for individual guilt or responsibility; the rebels aren’t so much choosing their actions as they are being swept along by powerful historical forces. This idea is at the heart of Dickens’s depiction of Foulon’s death; although he describes the killing itself as grotesque and cruel, he acknowledges that the people who committed it are neither by showing them interacting tenderly with their families in the hours afterwards. The implication is that they have simply been caught up in the violence of the mob without being particularly violent themselves. At the same time, however, the novel clearly presents this violence as morally wrong, which is where figures like Madame Defarge come in. Unlike the frenzied crowds, Madame Defarge is cool and calculating; for instance, the narrator describes her at one point “let[ting] [Foulon] go—as a cat might have done to a mouse—and silently and composedly look[ing] at him […] while he besought her” (234). She also has a larger-than-life influence on events around her; in fact, her knitting making her almost synonymous with destiny itself. As a result, she provides Dickens with a villain who bears clear and direct responsibility for the Revolution’s excesses, while allowing him to portray the bulk of the peasantry sympathetically.Meanwhile, the novel also provides a counterweight to Madame Defarge and the forces she embodies: Lucie’s symbolic “winding” of a “golden thread” contrasts with Madame Defarge’s knitting. In large part, this winding is a metaphor for domesticity, since the narrator describes it as binding the members of Lucie’s family to her and to one another. The suggestion, then, is that the blissful family life Lucie cultivates is a remedy to the violence and chaos of the Revolution. This perhaps reflects the common Victorian belief that women, by exerting moral influence in the domestic sphere, could solve many societal problems and make violent resistance unnecessary; the wife of a factory owner, for instance, could prevail on her husband to treat his workers more fairly. Even in A Tale of Two Cities, however, there are limits to the good that domesticity can do. In fact, it is precisely because the French women are so selflessly devoted to their families that they become violent; even Madame Defarge is ultimately motivated by love for her dead relatives, and therefore desire to avenge them.", "Book 3, Chapter 1 Summary: “In Secret”": "Darnay makes slow progress in France, where he is stopped at every town and questioned. He realizes that he won’t be able to leave the country until he has “been declared a good citizen” (255), but is still not seriously concerned, even when he is informed that as an aristocrat he must have an armed escort for the remainder of his journey. By the time he and his guards reach Beauvais, however, he is growing alarmed: the crowd there taunts him as a “traitor” (258), and he learns from the postmaster that a decree stripping emigrants of their property was passed the day he left London. Furthermore, it’s expected that a decree condemning emigrants to death is coming.At the gates of Paris, a man (Defarge) looks over Darnay’s papers, only to disappear momentarily. When he returns, he takes Darnay to a “guard-room, smelling of common wine and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake, drunk and sober […] were standing and lying about” (260). The officer in charge briefly questions Darnay about the whereabouts of his wife before telling him that he is being imprisoned in La Force. Darnay explains why he has returned and insists that he has a “right” to speak for Gabelle and for himself; the officer, however, says that France has “new laws,” and that “emigrants have no rights” (262).As Defarge escorts Darnay to prison, he asks (in apparent frustration) why Darnay returned to France. Darnay, meanwhile, asks whether he will be allowed to communicate from prison, and pleads with Defarge to at least pass the news of his imprisonment to Mr. Lorry. Defarge refuses, and they proceed to La Force in silence. As they do, Darnay hears from the surrounding crowds that the royal family is in prison. Even so, Darnay believes that brief imprisonment is the worst that’s likely to befall him.Defarge delivers Darnay to La Force, where the jailer grumbles that there is little room for another prisoner being held “in secret” (265). He leads Darnay through a large room full of jailed aristocrats, who “ris[e] to receive him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life” (265). Darnay, however, is marked for solitary confinement. Once in his cell, he begins to pace back and forth, counting the number of steps he can take.", "Book 3, Chapter 2 Summary: “The Grindstone”": "Mr. Lorry is sitting in Tellson’s Paris branch, which is located in a wing of a lavish mansion that once belonged to Monseigneur. The house has since been confiscated (and partially occupied) by the French Republic, and Lorry is troubled as he looks out the window into the courtyard, where a “grindstone” (269) has been erected. Just as he is feeling grateful that no one he knows is in Paris at the moment, Lucie and Doctor Manette enter the room.In great distress, Lucie explains that her husband has been imprisoned. Manette is calmer, telling Lorry that his status as a former prisoner of the Bastille gives him “a power that has brought [them] through the barrier, and gained [them] news of Charles” (271). Ultimately, he expects this same power will free Darnay. As Lorry listens, he attempts to prevent either Manette or his daughter from looking out the window. Once Lucie is in bed, however, Lorry allows Manette to see the courtyard, where rebels are sharpening weapons to murder prisoners: “The eye could not detect one creature in the group, free from the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to get next at the sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all over their limbs and bodies” (272). Seeing this, Manette goes out into the crowd and announces who he is in the hopes of stopping the massacre; the people greet him enthusiastically and begin to call for Darnay’s release.Meanwhile, Lorry tells Lucie what has happened, and learns that her daughter and Miss Pross have also come to Paris. The night passes slowly, with Lucie growing increasingly frightened by the noise from the grindstone (which Lorry tells her is being used by soldiers). When morning comes, the “grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had never given, and would never take away” (274).", "Book 3, Chapter 3 Summary: “The Shadow”": "Just as Lorry begins to worry about the consequences housing a prisoner’s family might have for Tellson’s, Lucie tells him that her father plans on renting rooms for the duration of their stay. Lorry therefore tracks down safe lodgings and helps the family move in, leaving Jerry behind as a guard.That night, Lorry is visited by a man whom he eventually recognizes as Defarge. Defarge explains that Doctor Manette has sent him, along with a note from Darnay. Lorry therefore asks Defarge to come with him to deliver the message to Lucie. As they step out into the courtyard, however, Lorry finds that two women—Madame Defarge and the Vengeance—are waiting. Defarge says that his wife is coming to see Lucie and the child so that she can recognize and protect them in the future.The group arrives to find Lucie in tears. She is somewhat consoled by her husband’s message, which assures her of Manette’s influence, and gratefully kisses Monsieur and Madame Defarge’s hands. Lorry explains why Madame Defarge has come and urges Lucie to have her daughter brought out. The Defarges then prepare to leave, but Lucie, alarmed by Madame Defarge’s coldness throughout the conversation, begs her to be kind to her husband for her sake and for her daughter’s sake. Madame Defarge, however, refuses to give her any assurance, rejecting her appeal “as a wife and mother” (278): “All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in themselves and in their children poverty, nakedness, hunger thirst, sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds” (279). The Defarges leave, and Lorry attempts to cheer Lucie up by reminding her of the good news about her husband. Lucie, however, remarks that “that dreadful woman seems to have thrown a shadow on [her] and on all [her] hopes” (279).", "Book 3, Chapter 4 Summary: “Calm in Storm”": "Doctor Manette is busy for the first three days after arriving in France. When he finally has a chance to recount what he has seen to Lorry, they decide to keep much of what is going on in France a secret from Lucie: while at La Force, Manette saw prisoners being brought before a makeshift tribunal and condemned to death (all told, the narrator estimates, 1,100 prisoners were killed during this period—now known as the September Massacres). Manette also witnessed firsthand the frenzied behavior of the crowds; he saw, for instance, people rush to the aid of a pardoned prisoner who had accidentally been hurt, only to “[plunge] anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor […] covered his eyes with his hands” (281).Nevertheless, Manette has been able to use his influence to achieve a great deal of good. Although he was unable to secure Darnay’s pardon—an “unexplained check” (280) prevented this just as the tribunal seemed most sympathetic to Manette’s arguments—Darnay was released from solitary confinement and allowed to send letters to his wife. Furthermore, Manette managed to get himself appointed as an “inspecting physician” (282) at three prisons, giving him further access to Darnay. As Manette talks, Lorry notices that he seems to have a renewed sense of purpose: Now that […] he knew himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which [Lucie and Lorry] both looked for Charles’s ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change, that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to trust to him as the strong (282).Manette’s efforts to free Darnay continue to meet with failure as the Revolution progresses and escalates. By the time Darnay has spent a year and three months in prison, the Reign of Terror is well underway: Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette have been executed, new courts have been established, definitions of counterrevolutionary activity have been expanded, and the Revolution’s more moderate leaders have been purged from the government and killed. As all of this becomes “the established order and nature of appointed things” (283), Manette continues to go about his business in the city, sure that he will eventually be successful. ", "Book 3, Chapter 5 Summary: “The Wood-Sawyer”": "Throughout the period of Darnay’s imprisonment, Lucie strives to maintain an atmosphere of normalcy, tutoring her daughter and keeping the house prepared for her husband, despite never being sure “but that the Guillotine would strike off [his] head next day” (285). When her father tells her, not long after their arrival, that Darnay might sometimes be able to see her from a prison window, she faithfully waits below for two hours every day.During one of these visits, a man sawing wood notices and greets Lucie (and, on a later visit, her daughter). The wood-sawyer, who also happens to be the mender of roads, hints that he knows Lucie is there to see someone in prison, but repeatedly insists that it’s “not [his] business” before returning to his saw, which he refers to cheerfully as his “Little Guillotine” (287). Lucie finds the man’s attention unnerving but tries to make friends with him over the course of her visits.In December of 1793, Lucie is again waiting outside the prison on “a day of some wild rejoicing, and a festival” (288). As she stands there, a crowd of people, including the wood-sawyer and the Vengeance, pass by singing and dancing the revolutionary “Carmagnole.” Manette emerges from the prison just as the crowd passes and reassures his frightened daughter that she doesn’t need to depend on the “mercies” (289) of the crowd: Darnay will be tried the following day, and Manette feels sure he will be “restored” (290) to Lucie. He tells Lucie he needs to go speak to Lorry in preparation for the trial.When Manette arrives at Tellson’s, someone else is there with Lorry, eager to hear news of Darnay’s trial. It later emerges that this person is Sydney Carton. ", "Book 3, Chapters 1-5 Analysis": "Darnay’s slowness to realize the danger of his position might seem implausible in hindsight, but the novel provides good reasons for it. On a purely practical level, Darnay is unaware of his legal status as an aristocratic emigrant, having left England just before those decrees were issued. It’s also clear, however, that Darnay isn’t thinking about guilt and innocence in the same way that the new French Republic is. Because Darnay himself has done what he can to help the lower classes, he assumes that he will be safe in revolutionary France. France, however—at least as represented by Madame Defarge—is increasingly thinking of guilt in ancestral terms. It therefore doesn’t matter that Darnay is personally innocent: when Defarge remarks that “other people have been similarly buried in worse prisons [than La Force],” Darnay protests “but never by me,” only to be “glanced [at] darkly” (263) by Defarge. Although Dickens clearly depicts this kind of guilt by association as wrong, the novel also acknowledges that justice is difficult to secure in the context of crimes that have been committed by entire classes of people over many years. This is one reason the idea of redemption is ultimately so central to A Tale of Two Cities—because the pursuit of justice often gives way to vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness as the only moral solutions.At this point, however, the full extent of Darnay’s danger isn’t clear, in part because it seems likely that Manette’s efforts will in fact secure his pardon. The novel deliberately highlights the similarities between Darnay’s current imprisonment and Manette’s years in the Bastille; in fact, Darnay himself dwells on the parallel, describing himself as “buried” (263) and mentally repeating a phrase—“He made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes” (267)—in time with his footsteps as he paces his cell. The link between the two men’s situations strongly suggests that Darnay’s fate hinges on Manette’s past imprisonment, and Manette himself puts it in exactly these terms when he talks about his “old pain [giving him] a power” (271). Dickens, in other words, establishes Manette in these chapters as a Christ-like figure whose suffering will spare Darnay the same fate. The fact that Manette is ultimately unable to do this stems from his own past involvement with Darnay’s family, once again underscoring the questions the novel poses about ancestral guilt. In the meantime, the narrator is clear that France has simply traded one form of oppression for another. Motifs that Dickens previously associated with the aristocracy now characterize the French Republic; the same sunlight that made the Marquis’s hands appear bloody, for instance, now has a similar effect on the courtyard where the grindstone stands. Furthermore, it’s now the common people who feed off of the aristocracy, with the narrator describing the Revolution’s victims as “red wine for La Guillotine” (285). Given that the narrator also likens the Guillotine to “the Cross” (284), the Christian symbolism of blood and wine is unmistakable. Ironically, however, the Revolution’s attempts to renew the country and “regenerat[e] the human race” by shedding blood only plunge it deeper into violence and immorality. The French Republic therefore grows to resemble the very regime it reacted against, which is one reason its worst actions quickly come to seem ordinary and inevitable; in some sense, they are just a continuation of the old order. As the narrator puts it: “[The changes to the laws] became the established order and nature of appointed things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old” (283).", "Book 3, Chapter 6 Summary: “Triumph” ": "Every day at La Force, the guards call out the names of those who will be tried that day. The prisoners say their goodbyes amongst themselves, and those remaining behind return to their daily routines. The “society” of prisoners is now entirely different than the one that first welcomed Darnay, since all of those people died in the September Massacre.On this particular day, Darnay’s name is read, and he is taken to a courtroom packed with spectators sporting red hats, tricolored cockades, and (in many cases) weapons. He notices Monsieur and Madame Defarge, the latter of whom is knitting and “seem[s] to be waiting for something with a dogged determination” (293).The prosecutor reads the charges against Darnay, who responds that he isn’t truly an “emigrant,” having “voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him” (293) long before the Revolution began. He cites Theophile Gabelle and Doctor Manette as witnesses, explaining that he is married to the latter’s daughter, and the crowd—which had previously been calling for Darnay’s head—immediately becomes sympathetic. Gabelle, who was released when Darnay himself was imprisoned, testifies to the truth of Darnay’s story. Finally, Doctor Manette takes the stand and dispels any remaining doubts the crowd has about where Darnay’s sympathies lie. When the jury unanimously finds Darnay innocent, the crowd rushes towards Darnay in excitement and carries him through the streets, cheering and dancing: In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing him out, they carried him on. Reddening the snowy streets with the prevailing Republican colour, in winding and trampling through them, as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried him thus into the court-yard of the building where he lived (296-97). The crowd disperses, and Darnay carries Lucie (who is near fainting) upstairs. As the family celebrates Darnay’s acquittal, Darnay urges Lucie to thank her father for securing it. Lucie therefore embraces her father, who reassures her that he has “saved” (297) Darnay. ", "Book 3, Chapter 7 Summary: “A Knock at the Door”": "Despite her father’s assurances, Lucie remains anxious, aware of how many innocent people are being put to death every day. She repeatedly warns Miss Pross against speaking disparagingly, even in their own home, of the chaos in France. Miss Pross, however, insists that as an Englishwoman, “[her] maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!” (300). She is impatient to leave France, but Doctor Manette says that it wouldn’t be safe for Darnay to leave so soon after his trial.Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher (whom the Manettes are employing in place of a servant) leave to do the day’s shopping. Not long after they’ve gone, there’s a knock on the door, and Lucie panics, begging her father to “hide Charles” (301). Manette once again reassures her that the danger is past, but when he opens the door, he is met by “four rough men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols” (301) who call for Darnay’s arrest. The men refuse to answer any questions about the new charges Darnay will face, but when Manette presses them, they eventually admit that the charges come from Saint Antoine. Specifically, Darnay has been “denounced” (304) by the Defarges and one other person. They will not tell Manette who this other is but give him a “strange look” (304) and tell him he will learn at the trial the next day.", "Book 3, Chapter 8 Summary: “A Hand at Cards”": "Avoiding crowds and overtly patriotic shops, Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher enter a relatively quiet-looking wine-shop. As they wait to place an order, Miss Pross notices the man in line in front of them and screams: it’s her long-lost brother Solomon.Solomon is irritated to see his sister and, pulling her outside to a secluded area, tells her to leave him alone: he is a government official and fears exposure. Meanwhile, Cruncher has also recognized Solomon, although he knows him by the name “John,” and claims he was a spy at the Old Bailey. Cruncher can’t recall the rest of Solomon’s alias, but Sydney Carton, who appears at that moment, says that it was “Barsad.” Carton explains that he arrived in Paris the night before, but that he decided not to come forward “unless [he] could be useful” (309). To that end, he wants to talk to Barsad, who is employed as a prison spy. Barsad reluctantly agrees, and after escorting Miss Pross home they head to Tellson’s, where Carton reveals to Lorry that Darnay has been arrested again. Carton says that while he hopes Doctor Manette’s influence will once again save Darnay, he has also devised a back-up plan: “Now, the stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr. Barsad” (312).Carton then reveals his “cards”—his knowledge that Barsad is employed under a false name, and that he used to spy on behalf of the English government. This leads Carton to believe that Barton is still working for the English government, and he threatens to expose him as a spy. Barsad takes these threats seriously; he is in an even more precarious position than Carton knows, having also spied for the deposed French monarchy.Nevertheless, Barsad resists until Carton reveals one final “card.” He believes Roger Cly is also serving as a spy in the French prisons. Barsad denies this, producing a certificate of Cly’s burial. Cruncher, however, is growing increasingly more agitated, and finally reveals that Cly’s coffin contained only “paving-stones and earth” (316)—he brushes aside questions of how he knows this. Barsad is therefore forced to admit that he and Cly fled England to escape public outrage, and he agrees to do what Carton asks provided it doesn’t place him in serious danger. Confirming that Barsad has access to the prison keys, Carton asks Barsad to follow him into another room where they can talk privately. ", "Book 3, Chapter 9 Summary: “The Game Made”": "As Carton and Barsad talk, Lorry threatens to fire Cruncher for his graverobbing. Cruncher points out that this is hypocritical, since Tellson’s freely serves the doctors that use the bodies Cruncher provides. He says that events in France have caused him to reevaluate his life, and he is considering taking up work as a regular gravedigger.Carton and Barsad reemerge, and once Barsad has left, Carton explains that Barsad will allow him to visit Darnay if the trial goes badly. He also asks Lorry not to tell Lucie about any of this for fear of troubling her but urges him to go to her and comfort her. The discussion of Lucie causes Carton to grow thoughtful, and he speaks to Lorry “wistfully” about the latter’s long life of “useful” (322) work, remarking that Lucie will surely mourn him when he dies: If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night, ‘I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!’ your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses, would they not? (322).After escorting Lorry to the Manettes’, Carton wanders the streets of Paris. He pauses where Lucie used to wait outside La Force and chats with the wood-sawyer, who talks excitedly about the number of people beheaded that day. He then goes to a chemist’s shop and buys substances the chemist warns him not to mix together. Finally, he wanders the streets aimlessly but with a “settled manner,” recalling his parents’ deaths, the deaths of those executed in Paris every day, and the Biblical passage read at this father’s funeral—“I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord” (325). Carton continues to walk until morning, watching as the sun rises. After sleeping for a while on the riverbank, Carton returns home, dresses, and goes to court.The prosecutor reads the charges against Darnay and reveals the three people who have denounced him: Monsieur and Madame Defarge, and Doctor Manette. Manette protests, but is forced to be quiet as Defarge testifies, revealing that he found a piece of paper in Manette’s former cell on the day the Bastille fell. The judge orders the paper to be read as Madame Defarge watches Darnay as though “feasting” (330).", "Book 3, Chapters 6-9 Analysis": "Dickens’s novels are known for their coincidences, and the revelation that Barsad is actually Solomon Pross, Miss Pross’s brother, is a good example of this. Within the context of A Tale of Two Cities, however, it’s also a reminder of the limitations of our ability to fully know others—in this case, because some people are quite literally not who they claim to be. Meanwhile, the fact that Roger Cly “died” only to resurface in France once again underscores the novel’s interest in resurrection. It does so, however, in a satirical way that contrasts with the truly life-and-death stakes at play in the very next chapter. Although the details of Carton’s plan are still not entirely clear at this point, Dickens heavily implies that it involves his own death. This is apparent not only in his unusually thoughtful mood as he speaks to Lorry, but also (and more specifically) in the question he poses about whether Lorry remembers his childhood; Lorry replies that as he draws closer to the end of his life, he seems to “travel in the circle, nearer and nearer to the beginning” (323)—something Carton, despite his young age, claims to understand. The implication is that Carton’s life is also drawing to a close.That said, the exchange also suggests that Carton is thinking of death not as an end but as a beginning—that is, as a rebirth into childhood innocence. The related idea of resurrection dominates the rest of the chapter, culminating in the narrator’s description of dawn ending “Death’s dominion\" (327). In other words, Carton’s impending death paradoxically allows him to truly live for perhaps the first time in the novel; he is hopeful and purposeful throughout Chapter 9 in a way he never has been before, and even Lorry notices the change in his demeanor. Moreover, what’s at stake isn’t simply Carton’s personal redemption; the narrator also positions Carton himself as a Christ figure. This is most obvious in Carton’s recitation of John 11:25—a passage that precedes Jesus’s resurrection of Lazarus—as he wanders the streets of Paris. Carton also takes on a Christ-like appearance, dressing in white and wearing his “long brown hair, all untrimmed, […] loose about him” (321). Given Carton’s moral ambiguity throughout much of A Tale of Two Cities, these parallels are unexpected, and raise the question of who or what Carton is sacrificing himself to save. The literal answer to that question is of course Darnay, but by the final pages of the novel, Carton’s death takes on much broader symbolic significance, perhaps even atoning for the crimes of both the Revolution and the regime that preceded it.", "Book 3, Chapter 10 Summary: “The Substance of the Shadow”": "In his statement, Manette identifies himself and explains that he writes this in the tenth year of his imprisonment, using ink made of “scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed with blood” (331).Manette then describes how, as he was walking one evening in 1757, two men in a carriage stopped him. The men have a patient they wish Manette to see, and since they are armed, Manette has no choice but to go with them.The carriage travels to a mansion, where the men take Manette to see a young woman who is delirious, tied to a bed, and who cries out continuously for her husband, father, and brother. Manette questions the two men (whom he now realizes are twin brothers) on the woman’s illness and is eventually taken to see another patient: a “handsome peasant boy” (335) a few years younger than the woman, dying of a sword wound.Manette asks how the boy was injured, and the “elder” brother (that is, the Marquis) explains that the boy insisted on dueling with his brother:There was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this answer. The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his vermin kind (336).The boy then offers his side of the story: the sick woman is his sister, and (like him) a tenant of the Evrémondes. She refused to sleep with the younger Evrémonde brother, so the Evrémondes worked her sick husband to death. Afterwards, the Marquis’s brother kidnapped and raped her. In response, the teenage boy hid his youngest sister away and then tracked down his sister’s rapist, receiving his fatal injury in the process. As the boy concludes his story, he dips his finger in his own blood and draws a cross in the air, “summon[ing]” the Marquis and his family to one day “answer” (339) for what they have done.The boy dies, and Manette returns to the sister. More than a day later, she “[sinks] into a lethargy” (339), and Manette, now able to examine her more closely, discovers that she is pregnant. She finally dies a week later, and Manette returns home under strict orders not to speak of what he has seen. Shortly afterwards, he receives a visit from the Marquis’s wife (Darnay’s mother), who hopes to atone for the family’s cruelty by helping the peasant family’s youngest daughter. Manette, however, is unable to tell her where the girl is.Disturbed by his experiences, Manette decides to write to the government. Shortly after he posts his letter, Manette is arrested and taken to the Bastille. He concludes his statement by cursing the Evrémonde brothers “and their descendants, to the last of their race” (344). Back in the present, Manette’s statement electrifies the courtroom. Unanimously, the jury sentences Darnay to death.", "Book 3, Chapter 11 Summary: “Dusk”": "Lucie nearly collapses when the verdict is read but manages to remain strong for her husband’s sake. Barsad takes pity on her and convinces the other jailers to allow Lucie a moment with Darnay, who blesses her and his child and assures her they will meet again in heaven. Darnay also prevents Doctor Manette from asking for forgiveness, saying that he respects him even more now that he knows the “natural antipathy” (347) he had to overcome to welcome Darnay into his family. Finally, he says that his fate is inevitable, because “good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning” (347).Lucie faints when her husband is taken away, and Carton catches her, carrying her to a coach and then into her home. As he kisses Lucie goodbye, her daughter overhears him whisper “a life you love” (349).Outside Lucie’s room, Carton urges Doctor Manette to try using his influence one more time. Manette promises to do so, and Carton says he will stop by Tellson’s later that night to learn if Manette was successful. After Manette leaves, Lorry says he doubts anyone would dare pardon Darnay given the mood of the courtroom earlier that day. Carton agrees, but says he asked Manette “because [he] felt that it might one day be consolatory to [Lucie]. Otherwise, she might think ‘his life was wantonly thrown away or wasted,’ and that might trouble her” (350). He then leaves, walking “with a settled step” (350).", "Book 3, Chapter 12 Summary: “Darkness”": "Carton decides to visit the Defarge’s wine-shop. Once there, Carton orders from Madame Defarge in uncharacteristically halting and heavily accented French. As Carton pretends to read a newspaper, Madame Defarge returns to her conversation with her husband, Jacques Three, and the Vengeance, remarking on how closely Carton resembles Darnay.The conversation then picks up where it apparently left off, with Defarge expressing discomfort and insisting that “one must stop somewhere” (352). His wife and the others don’t share this view, and as the argument progresses, it becomes clear that Madame Defarge wants to see Lucie Manette (and possibly her father and child) executed. When Defarge continues to protest, she reveals to Jacques Three and the Vengeance why she is so set against the Evrémondes: she is the younger sister of the peasant boy and girl Doctor Manette attended. Defarge, who learned this after he recovered Manette’s papers from the Bastille, is forced to admit that this is true, and Madame Defarge triumphantly concludes that it would be better to “tell Wind and Fire where to stop” (354) than to tell her.Carton leaves shortly afterwards, stopping to visit Barsad before returning to Tellson’s to wait for Manette. Manette doesn’t show up at the appointed time, however, and when he does, his manner immediately tells Lorry and Carton that “all [is] lost” (355). Manette has once again reverted to his behavior as a prisoner, asking in a “whimpering miserable way” (355) for his shoes and workbench. Lorry and Carton settle Manette in a chair, and Carton tells Lorry what he must do next: Lucie and her family’s travel papers are in danger of being revoked, so they need to leave the country as soon as possible. In fact, Carton says, Lucie is likely to be denounced by Madame Defarge, who (according to Barsad) has instructed the wood-sawyer to claim he saw Lucie “making signs and signals to prisoners” (357). Carton therefore urges Lorry to ensure that the family leaves the next day and entrusts Lorry with his own travel papers as well. However, when Lorry asks whether he ought to wait for Carton to return before leaving, Carton tells him to “wait for nothing but to have [his] place occupied” (358). Both Lorry and Carton say they hope to fulfill their roles “faithfully” (359), and Carton leaves shortly afterwards, stopping briefly under window.", "Book 3, Chapters 10-12 Analysis": "The chapter containing Doctor Manette’s written statement is one of the most pivotal moments in A Tale of Two Cities. Dickens has foreshadowed both the existence of this statement and its contents heavily; although Manette himself apparently doesn’t remember writing it, both his alarm at Darnay’s anecdote about the message left in the Tower of London and his state in the days following Darnay and Lucie’s wedding now make sense. What is less expected is Madame Defarge’s relationship to the peasant family Manette describes, and while she remains a villainous figure, the backstory goes a long way towards humanizing her. Dickens has contrasted Madame Defarge with Lucie Manette throughout the novel, but once again, there is more common ground between the two apparent opposites than is immediately obvious. In a sense, Madame Defarge is a twisted version of Lucie, similarly motivated by devotion to her family, but expressing that devotion through her quest for vengeance: That sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground was my sister, that husband was my sister’s husband, that unborn child was their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father, those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things descends to me! (354).Madame Defarge also grows more sympathetic in light of the revelation that even Doctor Manette gave into the desire for revenge against the entire Evrémonde family. Manette of course ultimately forgave Darnay and even welcomed him into his family, but the mere fact that someone so generous and merciful could have written what he did speaks to how terrible life under the Ancien Régime truly was. The idea of inheritance appears repeatedly in these chapters, with the peasant boy’s and Manette’s curses passing down from one generation of Evrémondes to the next, and Madame Defarge “inheriting” the duty of revenge. In a broader sense, all of French society is caught up in a kind of ancestral guilt, with even the victims of the old regime (Madame Defarge, Doctor Manette, etc.) morally tainted by it. Symbolically, this is one reason it is ultimately Carton rather than Manette who emerges as a Christ figure; the only person who can “break” the family curse on Darnay is someone who exists outside that web of guilt and revenge. Manette, through no particular fault of his own, is enmeshed in this history, and in fact ends this section of the novel once more trapped in memories of it.", "Book 3, Chapter 13 Summary: “Fifty-two”": "Darnay is to be executed at 3 o’clock the following day. As he waits in his cell, he tries to compose himself; he isn’t afraid of dying, but he is troubled by the thought of leaving his family. He writes a letter to his wife explaining that he didn’t know his family was behind her father’s imprisonment and urging her to remind Manette that he isn’t responsible for Darnay’s fate. After writing to Manette and Lorry as well, Darnay goes to bed, dreaming that he has reunited with his wife and child. The next day, he remains calm by counting off the hours until it’s time.Shortly after 1 o’clock, Darnay hears footsteps, and Carton appears inside his cell. Carton claims that Lucie has sent him, and that Darnay must do exactly as she asks. He persuades Darnay to exchange boots with him, and to untie his hair; Darnay protests all of this, saying any escape is impossible, but Carton overrides him with “a strength, both of will and action, that appear[s] quite supernatural” (364). Finally, Carton asks Darnay to compose a letter he (Carton) will dictate: the letter reminds its recipient (Lucie) of a promise the writer (Carton) once made to her, and urges her not to feel “regret or grief” (365)that he has been able to keep that promise.As Darnay writes, Carton reaches for a chloroform-like sedative in his pocket. At the last minute, Darnay realizes what Carton is trying to do, but is unable to prevent it and falls unconscious. Carton finishes dressing himself like Darnay and calls for Barsad, who carries Darnay away under the pretext that “Carton” fainted from emotion.Shortly afterwards, Carton is taken to a room along with fifty-one other condemned prisoners. One—a young seamstress—approaches Carton and explains that they met at La Force. She says she doesn’t understand how “the Republic, which is to do so much good to [the] poor, will profit by [her] death” (368), and asks if she can hold his hand for strength. As they talk, however, she suddenly realizes that Carton isn’t Darnay. He admits that he has exchanged places with Darnay for the sake of the latter’s family but reassures her that he will stay beside her regardless.Meanwhile, the coach carrying Lucie, Darnay, their child, Doctor Manette, and Mr. Lorry is leaving Paris. Their papers are examined, and no one suspects who Darnay actually is. The coach continues on, and although Lucie is terrified that they will be stopped at some point, nothing “pursue[s]” them except “the whole wild night” (372).  ", "Book 3, Chapter 14 Summary: “The Knitting Done”": "On the afternoon of the executions, Madame Defarge meets with Jacques Three, the Vengeance, and the wood-sawyer in the wood-sawyer’s home. She explains that her husband has a soft spot for Doctor Manette, and that she has therefore decided to pursue vengeance against Lucie Manette and her child without his knowledge or help. The wood-sawyer, who is clearly frightened of Madame Defarge, demonstrates the “signals” he supposedly saw Lucie making, and everyone pretends to agree that the evidence is damning. Finally, Madame Defarge makes arrangements to meet with the Vengeance at the guillotine later that afternoon; in the meantime, she is going to visit Lucie in the hopes that the knowledge of Darnay’s impending death will have put her “in a state of mind to impeach the justice of the Republic” (375).Meanwhile, Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher are preparing to leave Paris. To avoid drawing attention to the Manettes’ house, Miss Pross proposes that Cruncher and the coach wait for her at a nearby cathedral. He agrees, amidst many promises to mend his ways when they are back in England.Cruncher leaves and Miss Pross prepares to do the same, but she is interrupted by the arrival of Madame Defarge, who demands to see Lucie. Although she can’t understand French, Miss Pross senses that Madame Defarge means harm and places herself in front of Lucie’s room; Madame Defarge has already noted the other rooms are empty, and Miss Pross doesn’t want her to know for certain that the family has fled. Madame Defarge lunges for the door, and the two women struggle. Just as Madame Defarge tries to pull a revolver from her dress, Miss Pross strikes at it, shooting Madame Defarge.Miss Pross rushes to the cathedral, making sure to throw the house keys in the river. When she reaches Cruncher, she asks him whether the streets are noisy, but it quickly becomes clear that she can’t hear his response; the gunshot has rendered her permanently deaf.", "Book 3, Chapter 15 Summary: “The Footsteps Die Out For Ever”": "The carts full of prisoners make their way toward the guillotine, which the narrator describes as the culmination of the suffering that preceded the Revolution. As the carts pass through the crowd, many spectators want to know which of the prisoners is Evrémonde. One of these onlookers asks Barsad, who points out a man whose attention is fixed on a young woman next to him. The onlooker begins to jeer at “Evrémonde,” but Barsad quiets him: “He is going to pay the forfeit; it will be paid in five minutes more. Let him be at peace” (386). Meanwhile, the Vengeance waits with a crowd of knitting women seated near the guillotine, concerned that Madame Defarge will miss her crowning achievement: Evrémonde’s death.As the executions begin, the seamstress thanks Carton for lending her strength, and he urges her to look at him rather than at their surroundings. She does, but also expresses one final concern: she has a cousin, and she is afraid that “it will seem long […] while [she] wait[s] for her in the better land” (388). Carton assures her that “there is no Time there, and no trouble there” (388), and kisses her as she is led away. He mounts the scaffold next, reciting John 11:25, and the knitting women count “twenty-three” (388) as he is executed.The narrator remarks that those who witnessed Carton’s execution said that he “looked sublime and prophetic” (389). He then imagines what Carton’s “prophetic” thoughts might have been, if he had been allowed to give voice to them before his death. Carton looks out over the crowd, foreseeing that many of the people gathered there will eventually die by the guillotine themselves, but that “a beautiful city and a brilliant people [will rise] from this abyss” (389) and atone for all of the suffering that has come before. He then envisions Lucie and her friends and family happy and thriving as they grow older and takes comfort in knowing that they will remember him lovingly and even name a son after him. He concludes: “It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known” (390).", "Book 3, Chapters 13-15 Analysis": "As famous as the final lines of A Tale of Two Cities are, what precedes them is equally significant. The final fight between Miss Pross and Madame Defarge, for instance, is central to the novel’s overall meaning. The narrator is quite clear that it is love that allows Miss Pross to prevail: “It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross, with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate, clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had” (382). Madame Defarge’s death renders her “victory” over the Evrémondes hollow, since she doesn’t live to see Darnay’s execution (the fact that it isn’t even Darnay being executed adds an additional layer of irony). Since Madame Defarge is in many ways a figurehead for the worst and most violent impulses of the French Revolution, the implication is that these too will be defeated.This is certainly what Carton’s final vision suggests, since he foresees a reborn and even utopian society rising out of the current bloodshed. However, it’s not simply the content of Carton’s speech but also its placement that underscores the ultimate hopefulness of the novel; in a final nod toward the theme of resurrection, Carton actually “speaks\" after the moment of his execution, and consequently seems to have survived his own death. The message is therefore not only of societal but also of personal rebirth, and Carton’s redemption isn’t just a matter of overcoming his particular apathy and despair, but also of overcoming a kind of isolation common to all people.Early on in the novel, the narrator describes death as “the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in [each person’s] individuality” (15). Ultimately, however, this proves to be untrue; after being trapped inside his own mind for the entire novel, Carton finds authentic human connection only in the moments before his death (in his interactions with the seamstress) and in death itself (by speaking directly to the readers in a way no other character does). Carton’s death, in other words, is the culmination of the novel’s Christian symbolism, not only because it involves a sacrifice on behalf of others, but also because it portrays physical death as far less terrible than the “spiritual” death that in Carton’s case preceded it.The novel’s last few chapters also contain a final warning to readers. As the carts approach the guillotine, the narrator lingers once again on the inevitability of this violence, given what preceded it: “Crush humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression ever again, and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind” (385). Carton’s conversation with the seamstress offers a spiritual solution to this problem; heaven is a place with “no time” (388), and therefore, none of the historical trends that have brought France to this point. Dickens, however, is also clearly concerned with what happens in this life, and therefore wants his readers to understand what caused the Revolution, so that they can prevent another like it."}}, "num_tokens": 211774}

What, have you lost your wits ?\n\nRODERIGO. Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?\n\nBRABANTIO. Not I, what are you?\n\nRODERIGO. My name is Roderigo.\n\nBRABANTIO.

Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service, you think we are ruffian s , [110] you’ll have your daughter cover’d with a Barbary horse; you’ll have your nephew s  neigh to you; you’ll have courser s for cousins, and gennet s for german s .\n\nBRABANTIO. What profane  wretch  art thou ? [115]\n\nIAGO. I am one, sir, that comes to tell you, your daughter, and the Moor, are now making the beast with two backs .\n\nBRABANTIO. Thou art a villain .\n\nIAGO.    You are a senator.\n\nBRABANTIO. This thou shalt answer, I know thee, Roderigo. [120]\n\nRODERIGO. Sir, I will answer anything. But I beseech you,\n\nIf’t be your pleasure, and most wise consent ,\n\n(As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter,\n\nAt this odd-even and dull watch o’ the night,\n\nTransported with no worse nor better guard, [125]\n\nBut with a knave of common hire , a gondolier,\n\nTo the gross  clasp s of a lascivious Moor:\n\nIf this be known to you, and your allowance ,\n\nWe then have done you bold and saucy wrongs.\n\nBut if you know not this, my manners tell me, [130]\n\nWe have your wrong rebuke . Do not believe\n\nThat from the sense of all civility ,\n\nI thus would play and trifle with your reverence .\n\nYour daughter (if you have not given her leave ,\n\nI say again), hath made a gross revolt, [135]\n\nTying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes,\n\nIn an extravagant and wheeling stranger,\n\nOf here, and every where: straight satisfy yourself.\n\nIf she be in her chamber , or your house,\n\nLet loose on me the justice of the state [140]\n\nFor this delusion .\n\nBRABANTIO.    Strike on the tinder , ho!\n\nGive me a taper , call up all my people:\n\nThis accident is not unlike my dream,\n\nBelief of it oppresses me already:\n\nLight I say, light!\n\n( Exit above.)\n\nIAGO.    Farewell, for I must leave you: [145]\n\nIt seems not meet , nor wholesome to my place,\n\nTo be produc’d , as if I stay I shall,\n\nAgainst the Moor, for I do know the state,\n\nHowever this may gall him with some check ,\n\nCannot with safety cast him, for he’s embark ’d , [150]\n\nWith such loud reason, to the Cyprus wars,\n\nWhich even now stands in act , that, for their souls,\n\nAnother of his fathom they have not\n\nTo lead their business, in which regard,\n\n Thou gh I do hate him, as I do hell’s pains, [155]\n\nYet, for necessity of present life,\n\nI must show out a flag, and sign of love,\n\nWhich is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,\n\nLead to the Sagittar the raised search,\n\nAnd there will I be with him. So farewell. [160]\n\n(Exit.)\n\n(Enter Brabantio in his night-gown, and Servants with torch es .)\n\nBRABANTIO. It is too true an evil, gone she is,\n\nAnd what’s to come, of my despised time,\n\nIs nought but bitterness. Now Roderigo,\n\nWhere didst thou see her? (O unhappy girl!)\n\nWith the Moor, say’st thou? (Who would be a father?) [165]\n\nHow didst thou know ’twas she? (O thou deceivest me\n\nPast thought!) What said she to you? Get more tapers,\n\nRaise all my kindred , are they married, think you?\n\nRODERIGO. Truly I think they are.\n\nBRABANTIO. O heaven, how got she out? O treason of the blood! [170]\n\nFathers from hence , trust not your daughters’ minds\n\nBy what you see them act, is there not charms,\n\nBy which the property of youth and maidhood\n\nMay be abus’d ? Have you not read, Roderigo,\n\nOf some such thing? [175]\n\nRODERIGO. I have, sir.\n\nBRABANTIO. Call up my brother: O that you had had her!\n\nSome one way, some another; do you know\n\nWhere we may apprehend her, and the Moor?\n\nRODERIGO. I think I can discover him, if you please [180]\n\nTo get good guard, and go along with me.\n\nBRABANTIO. Pray lead me on, at every house I’ll call,\n\nI may command at most: get weapons, ho!\n\nAnd raise some special officers of night:\n\nOn, good Roderigo, I’ll deserve your pains. [185]\n\n( Exeunt .)\n\nScene 2\n\nBefore the Sagittar.\n\nEnter Othello, Iago, and attendants with torches.\n\nIAGO. Though in the trade of war I have slain men,\n\nYet do I hold it very stuff of conscience\n\nTo do no contriv’d murder; I lack iniquity\n\nSometimes to do me service: nine or ten times\n\nI had thought to have yerk ’d him here, under the rib s . [5]\n\nOTHELLO. ’Tis better as it is.\n\nIAGO. Nay , but he prate d ,\n\nAnd spoke such scurvy and provoking terms\n\nAgainst your honour,\n\nThat with the little godliness I have,\n\nI did full hard forbear him: but I pray, sir, [10]\n\nAre you fast married? For be sure of this,\n\nThat the magnifico is much belov’d,\n\nAnd hath in his effect a voice potential\n\nAs double as the duke’s; he will divorce you,\n\nOr put upon you what restraint , and grievance , [15]\n\nThat law (with all his might to enforce it on)\n\nWill give him cable .\n\nOTHELLO.    Let him do his spite ;\n\nMy services, which I have done the signiory ,\n\nShall out-tongue  his complaints; ’tis yet to know –\n\nWhich, when I know that boasting is an honour, [20]\n\nI shall provulgate – I fetch my life and being\n\nFrom men of royal siege , and my demerits\n\nMay speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune\n\nAs this that I have reach’d; for know, Iago,\n\nBut that I love the gentle Desdemona, [25]\n\nI would not my unhoused free condition\n\nPut into circumscription and confine\n\nFor the sea’s worth. But look what lights come yonder .\n\nIAGO. These are the raised father and his friends,\n\nYou were best go in.\n\nOTHELLO.    Not I, I must be found: [30]\n\nMy parts, my title, and my perfect soul,\n\nShall manifest me rightly: is it they?\n\nIAGO. By Janus I think no.\n\n(Enter Cassio, with Officers, and torches.)\n\nOTHELLO. The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.\n\nThe goodness of the night upon you, friends! [35]\n\nWhat is the news?\n\nCASSIO.    The duke does greet you, general,\n\nAnd he requires your haste post- haste appearance,\n\nEven on the instant .\n\nOTHELLO.    What’s the matter, think you?\n\nCASSIO. Something from Cyprus, as I may divine ;\n\nIt is a business of some heat, the galley s  [40]\n\nHave sent a dozen sequent messengers\n\nThis very night, at one another’s heels:\n\nAnd many of the consuls, rais’d and met,\n\nAre at the duke’s already; you have been hotly call’d for,\n\nWhen, being not at your lodging to be found, [45]\n\nThe senate sent about three several quest s\n\nTo search you out.\n\nOTHELLO.    ’Tis well I am found by you:\n\nI will but spend a word here in the house,\n\nAnd go with you.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nCASSIO.    Ancient, what makes he here?\n\nIAGO. Faith , he to-night hath board ed a land carrack : [50]\n\nIf it prove lawful prize , he’s made for ever.\n\nCASSIO. I do not understand.\n\nIAGO.    He’s married.\n\nCASSIO.        To who?\n\n(Enter Othello.)\n\nIAGO. Marry to ... Come, captain, will you go?\n\nOTHELLO.    Ha’ with you.\n\nCASSIO. Here comes another troop to seek for you.\n\n(Enter Brabantio, Roderigo, and others with lights and weapons.)\n\nIAGO. It is Brabantio, general, be advis’d , [55]\n\nHe comes to bad intent .\n\nOTHELLO.    Holla, stand there!\n\nRODERIGO. Signior, it is the Moor.\n\nBRABANTIO.    Down with him, thief!\n\n(They draw on both sides.)\n\nIAGO. You, Roderigo, come sir, I am for you.\n\nOTHELLO. Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust ’em;\n\nGood signior, you shall more command with years [60]\n\nThan with your weapons.\n\nBRABANTIO. O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow ’d my daughter?\n\nDamn’d as thou art, thou hast enchant ed her,\n\nFor I’ll refer me to all things of sense,\n\n(If she in chains of magic were not bound) [65]\n\nWhether a maid, so tender , fair, and happy,\n\nSo opposite to marriage, that she shun n’d\n\nThe wealthy curled darlings of our nation,\n\nWould ever have (to incur a general mock )\n\nRun from her guardage to the sooty  bosom  [70]\n\nOf such a thing as thou? to fear, not to delight.\n\nJudge me the world, if ’tis not gross in sense,\n\nThat thou hast practis’d on her with foul charms,\n\nAbus’d her delicate youth, with drugs or minerals ,\n\nThat weakens motion: I’ll have ’t disputed  on; [75]\n\n’Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.\n\nI therefore apprehend and do attach thee,\n\nFor an abuser of the world, a practiser\n\nOf arts inhibited , and out of warrant ;\n\nLay hold upon him, if he do resist, [80]\n\n Subdue him at his peril .\n\nOTHELLO.    Hold your hands,\n\nBoth you of my inclining and the rest:\n\nWere it my cue to fight, I should have known it,\n\nWithout a prompter ; where will you that I go,\n\nAnd answer this your charge?\n\nBRABANTIO.    To prison, till fit time [85]\n\nOf law, and course of direct session ,\n\nCall thee to answer.\n\nOTHELLO.    What if I do obey?\n\nHow may the duke be therewith satisfied,\n\nWhose messengers are here about my side,\n\nUpon some present business of the state, [90]\n\nTo bear me to him?\n\nOFFICER.    ’Tis true, most worthy signior,\n\nThe duke’s in council , and your noble self,\n\nI am sure is sent for.\n\nBRABANTIO.    How? the duke in council?\n\nIn this time of the night? Bring him away;\n\nMine’s not an idle cause, the duke himself, [95]\n\nOr any of my brothers of the state ,\n\nCannot but feel this wrong, as ’twere their own.\n\nFor if such actions may have passage free,\n\n Bond-slave s , and pagan s , shall our statesmen be.\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nScene 3\n\nA Council Chamber.\n\nEnter Duke and Senators, set at a table with lights and Attendants.\n\nDUKE. There is no composition in these news,\n\nThat gives them credit .\n\nFIRST SENATOR.    Indeed they are disproportion’d ;\n\nMy letters say, a hundred and seven galleys.\n\nDUKE. And mine a hundred and forty.\n\nSECOND SENATOR.    And mine two hundred:\n\nBut though they jump not on a just account , [5]\n\n(As in these cases, where they aim reports ,\n\n’Tis oft with difference,) yet do they all confirm\n\nA Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.\n\nDUKE. Nay, it is possible enough to judgement:\n\nI do not so secure me to the error, [10]\n\nBut the main articles I do approve\n\nIn fearful sense.\n\nSAILOR (within). What ho! what ho! what ho!\n\nOFFICER . A messenger from the galleys.\n\n(Enter Sailor.)\n\nDUKE.    Now, the business?\n\nSAILOR. The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes,\n\nSo was I bid report here, to the state, [15]\n\n By Signior Angelo.\n\nDUKE. How s ay you by this change?\n\nFIRST SENATOR.    This cannot be\n\nBy no assay of reason ... ’tis a pageant ,\n\n To keep us in false gaze : when we consider\n\nThe importancy of Cyprus to the Turk; [20]\n\nAnd let ourselves again but understand,\n\nThat as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,\n\nSo may he with more facile  question bear it,\n\nFor that it stands not in such warlike brace ,\n\nBut altogether lacks the abilities [25]\n\nThat Rhodes is dress’d in . If we make thought of this,\n\nWe must not think the Turk is so unskilful\n\nTo leave that latest, which concerns him first,\n\nNeglecting an attempt of ease, and gain,\n\nTo wake and wage a danger profitless. [30]\n\nDUKE. Nay, in all confidence, he’s not for Rhodes.\n\nOFFICER . Here is more news.\n\n(Enter a Messenger.)\n\nMESSENGER. The Ottomites , reverend and gracious ,\n\nSteering with due course, toward the isle of Rhodes,\n\nHave there injoint ed with an after fleet – [35]\n\nFIRST SENATOR. Ay, so I thought; how many, as you guess?\n\nMESSENGER. Of thirty sail, and now they do re-stem\n\nTheir backward course, bearing with frank appearance\n\nTheir purposes towards Cyprus: Signior Montano,\n\nYour trusty and most valiant  servitor , [40]\n\nWith his free duty recommends you thus,\n\nAnd prays you to believe him.\n\nDUKE. ’Tis certain then for Cyprus;\n\nMarcus Luccicos is not here in town?\n\nFIRST SENATOR. He’s now in Florence. [45]\n\nDUKE. Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch .\n\nFIRST SENATOR. Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.\n\n(Enter Brabantio, Othello, Cassio, Iago, Roderigo, and Officers.)\n\nDUKE. Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you,\n\nAgainst the general enemy Ottoman;\n\n(To Brabantio.)\n\nI did not see you; welcome, gentle signior, [50]\n\nWe lack’d your counsel and your help to-night.\n\nBRABANTIO. So did I yours: good your grace , pardon me,\n\nNeither my place, nor aught I heard of business,\n\nHath rais’d me from my bed, nor doth the general care\n\nTake any hold of me, for my particular grief  [55]\n\nIs of so flood-gate and o’erbearing nature,\n\nThat it englut s and swallows other sorrows,\n\nAnd it is still itself.\n\nDUKE.    Why, what’s the matter?\n\nBRABANTIO. My daughter, O my daughter!\n\nALL.    Dead?\n\nBRABANTIO.        Ay, to me:\n\nShe is abus’d, stol’n from me and corrupted , [60]\n\nBy spell s and medicines, bought of mountebank s ,\n\nFor nature so preposterously to err ,\n\n(Being not deficient , blind, or lame of sense,)\n\n Sans  witchcraft could not.\n\nDUKE. Whoe’er he be, that in this foul proceeding  [65]\n\nHath thus beguil’d your daughter of herself,\n\nAnd you of her, the bloody book of law\n\nYou shall yourself read, in the bitter letter,\n\nAfter its own sense, though our proper son\n\nStood in your action.\n\nBRABANTIO. Humbly I thank your grace; [70]\n\nHere is the man, this Moor, whom now it seems\n\nYour special mandate , for the state-affairs,\n\nHath hither brought.\n\nALL.    We are very sorry for ’t.\n\nDUKE (to Othello). What in your own part can you say to this?\n\nBRABANTIO. Nothing, but this is so. [75]\n\nOTHELLO. Most potent , grave, and reverend signiors,\n\nMy very noble and approv’d good masters:\n\nThat I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter,\n\nIt is most true: true, I have married her,\n\nThe very head and front of my offending  [80]\n\nHath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,\n\nAnd little blest with the set  phrase of peace,\n\nFor since these arms of mine had seven years’ pith ,\n\nTill now some nine moons wasted, they have us’d\n\nTheir dearest action in the tented field, [85]\n\nAnd little of this great world can I speak,\n\nMore than pertains to  feat s of broil , and battle,\n\nAnd therefore little shall I grace my cause,\n\nIn speaking for myself: yet, (by your gracious patience)\n\nI will a round unvarnish’d  tale deliver, [90]\n\nOf my whole course of love, what drugs, what charms,\n\nWhat conjuration , and what mighty magic,\n\n(For such proceedings am I charged withal )\n\nI won his daughter.\n\nBRABANTIO.    A maiden never bold of spirit,\n\nSo still and quiet, that her motion [95]\n\n Blush ’d at her self: and she, in spite of nature,\n\nOf years, of country, credit, everything,\n\nTo fall in love with what she fear’d to look on?\n\nIt is a judgement maim ’d , and most imperfect,\n\nThat will confess perfection so would err [100]\n\nAgainst all rules of nature, and must be driven\n\nTo find out practices of cunning hell,\n\nWhy this should be; I therefore vouch again,\n\nThat with some mixtures powerful o’er the blood,\n\nOr with some dram  conjur’d to this effect, [105]\n\nHe wrought upon her.\n\nDUKE.    To vouch this is no proof,\n\nWithout more certain and more overt test;\n\nThese are thin habit s , and poor likelihoods\n\nOf modern seeming s , you prefer against him.\n\nFIRST SENATOR. But, Othello, speak, [110]\n\nDid you by indirect and forced courses\n\n Subdue  and poison this young maid’s affections?\n\nOr came it by request, and such fair question,\n\nAs soul to soul afford eth ?\n\nOTHELLO.    I do beseech you,\n\nSend for the lady to the Sagittar, [115]\n\nAnd let her speak of me before her father;\n\nIf you do find me foul in her report,\n\nThe trust, the office, I do hold of you,\n\nNot only take away, but let your sentence\n\nEven fall upon my life.\n\nDUKE.    Fetch Desdemona hither. [120]\n\n(Two or three attendants move towards the door.)\n\nOTHELLO (to Iago) . Ancient, conduct them, you best know the place:\n\n(Exeunt Attendants and Iago.)\n\nAnd till she come, as faithful as to heaven\n\nI do confess the vice s of my blood,\n\nSo justly to your grave ears I’ll present\n\nHow I did thrive in this fair lady’s love, [125]\n\nAnd she in mine.\n\nDUKE. Say it, Othello.\n\nOTHELLO. Her father lov’d me, oft invited me,\n\nStill question’d me the story of my life,\n\nFrom year to year; the battles, siege s , fortunes, [130]\n\nThat I have pass’d:\n\nI ran it through, even from my boyish days,\n\nTo the very moment that he bade me tell it.\n\nWherein I spake of most disastrous chances,\n\nOf moving accidents by flood and field; [135]\n\nOf hair-breadth scape s i’ th’ imminent deadly breach ;\n\nOf being taken by the insolent  foe ;\n\nAnd sold to slavery, and my redemption  thence ,\n\nAnd with it all my travel’s history;\n\nWherein of antre s vast, and deserts idle, [140]\n\nRough quarries , rocks and hills, whose heads touch heaven,\n\nIt was my hint  to speak, such was the process:\n\nAnd of the Cannibals, that each other eat;\n\nThe Anthropophagi , and men whose heads\n\nDo grow beneath their shoulders: this to hear [145]\n\nWould Desdemona seriously incline ;\n\nBut still the house-affairs would draw her thence,\n\nAnd ever as she could with haste dispatch ,\n\nShe’ld come again, and with a greedy ear\n\n Devour  up my discourse ; which I observing, [150]\n\nTook once a pliant hour, and found good means\n\nTo draw from her a prayer of earnest heart,\n\nThat I would all my pilgrimage  dilate ,\n\nWhereof by parcel she had something heard,\n\nBut not intentively : I did consent , [155]\n\nAnd often did beguile her of her tears,\n\nWhen I did speak of some distressed stroke\n\nThat my youth suffer’d: my story being done,\n\nShe gave me for my pains a world of sighs;\n\nShe swore i’ faith ’twas strange, ’twas passing strange; [160]\n\n’Twas pitiful , ’twas wondrous pitiful;\n\nShe wish’d she had not heard it, yet she wish’d\n\nThat heaven had made her such a man: she thank’d me,\n\nAnd bade me, if I had a friend that lov’d her,\n\nI should but teach him how to tell my story, [165]\n\nAnd that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:\n\nShe lov’d me for the dangers I had pass’d,\n\nAnd I lov’d her that she did pity them.\n\nThis only is the witchcraft I have us’d:\n\nHere comes the lady, let her witness it. [170]\n\n(Enter Desdemona, Iago, Attendants.)\n\nDUKE. I think this tale would win my daughter too, ...\n\nGood Brabantio,\n\nTake up this mangled matter at the best;\n\nMen do their broken weapons rather use,\n\nThan their bare hands.\n\nBRABANTIO.    I pray you hear her speak. [175]\n\nIf she confess that she was half the wooer,\n\nDestruction light on me, if my bad blame\n\nLight on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress :\n\nDo you perceive in all this noble company,\n\nWhere most you owe  obedience ?\n\nDESDEMONA.    My noble father, [180]\n\nI do perceive here a divided duty:\n\nTo you I am bound for life and education,\n\nMy life and education both do learn me\n\nHow to respect you, you are lord of all my duty,\n\nI am hitherto your daughter: but here’s my husband: [185]\n\nAnd so much duty as my mother show’d\n\nTo you, preferring you before her father,\n\nSo much I challenge , that I may profess,\n\nDue to the Moor my lord.\n\nBRABANTIO. God bu’y , I ha’ done:\n\nPlease it your grace, on to the state-affairs; [190]\n\nI had rather to adopt a child than get it;\n\nCome hither, Moor:\n\nI here do give thee that, with all my heart,\n\nWhich, but thou hast already, with all my heart\n\nI would keep from thee. For your sake (jewel) [195]\n\nI am glad at soul I have no other child,\n\nFor thy escape would teach me tyranny,\n\nTo hang clog s on ’em; I have done, my lord.\n\nDUKE. Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,\n\nWhich as a grise or step may help these lovers [200]\n\nInto your favour.\n\nWhen remedies are past, the griefs are ended,\n\nBy seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.\n\nTo mourn a mischief  that is past and gone,\n\nIs the next way to draw more mischief on. [205]\n\nWhat cannot be preserv’d when fortune takes,\n\nPatience her injury a mockery makes.\n\nThe robb’d that smiles, steals something from the thief,\n\nHe robs himself, that spends a bootless grief.\n\nBRABANTIO. So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile, [210]\n\nWe lose it not so long as we can smile;\n\nHe bears the sentence well, that nothing bears\n\nBut the free comfort which from thence he hears:\n\nBut he bears both the sentence and the sorrow,\n\nThat, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow. [215]\n\nThese sentences to sugar, or to gall ,\n\nBeing strong on both sides, are equivocal :\n\nBut words are words; I never yet did hear\n\nThat the bruis’d heart was pierce d through the ear:\n\nBeseech you now, to the affairs of the state. [220]\n\nDUKE. The Turk with most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus: Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you, and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency , yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effect s , throws a more safer [225] voice on you: you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes, with this more stubborn and boisterous  expedition .\n\nOTHELLO. The tyrant custom , most grave senators,\n\nHath made the flinty and steel couch of war [230]\n\nMy thrice-driven bed of down : I do agnize\n\nA natural and prompt alacrity\n\nI find in hardness, and would undertake\n\nThis present wars against the Ottomites.\n\nMost humbly therefore, bending to your state, [235]\n\nI crave fit disposition for my wife,\n\nDue reference of place, and exhibition ,\n\nWith such accommodation and besort\n\nAs level s with her breeding .\n\nDUKE.    If you please,\n\nBe ’t at her father’s.\n\nBRABANTIO.    I’ll not have it so. [240]\n\nOTHELLO. Nor I.\n\nDESDEMONA.    Nor I, I would not there reside ,\n\nTo put my father in impatient thoughts,\n\nBy being in his eye: most gracious duke,\n\nTo my unfolding lend a gracious ear,\n\nAnd let me find a charter in your voice, [245]\n\nAnd if my simpleness ...\n\nDUKE. What would you ... speak.\n\nDESDEMONA. That I did love the Moor, to live with him,\n\nMy downright  violence , and scorn of fortunes,\n\nMay trumpet to the world: my heart’s subdued [250]\n\nEven to the utmost pleasure of my lord:\n\nI saw Othello’s visage in his mind,\n\nAnd to his honours, and his valiant parts\n\nDid I my soul and fortunes consecrate :\n\nSo that, dear lords, if I be left behind, [255]\n\nA moth of peace, and he go to the war,\n\nThe rite s for which I love him are bereft me,\n\nAnd I a heavy interim shall support,\n\nBy his dear absence; let me go with him.\n\nOTHELLO. Your voices, Lords: beseech you, let her will [260]\n\nHave a free way; I therefore beg it not\n\nTo please the palate of my appetite,\n\nNor to comply with heat, the young affects\n\nIn my defunct , and proper satisfaction,\n\nBut to be free and bounteous of her mind; [265]\n\nAnd heaven defend your good souls that you think\n\nI will your serious and great business scant ,\n\nFor she is with me; ... no, when light-wing’d toys,\n\nAnd feather’d Cupid , foil s with wanton  dullness\n\nMy speculative and active instruments , [270]\n\nThat my disport s corrupt and taint my business,\n\nLet housewives make a skillet of my helm,\n\nAnd all indign and base adversities\n\nMake head against my reputation !\n\nDUKE. Be it, as you shall privately determine, [275]\n\nEither for stay or going, the affairs cry haste,\n\nAnd speed must answer; you must hence to-night.\n\nDESDEMONA. To-night, my Lord?\n\nDUKE.    This night.\n\nOTHELLO.        With all my heart.\n\nDUKE. At ten i’ the morning here we’ll meet again.\n\nOthello, leave some officer behind, [280]\n\nAnd he shall our commission bring to you,\n\nWith such things else of quality or respect\n\nAs doth concern you.\n\nOTHELLO.    Please your grace, my ancient,\n\nA man he is of honesty and trust,\n\nTo his conveyance I assign my wife, [285]\n\nWith what else needful your good grace shall think\n\nTo be sent after me.\n\nDUKE.    Let it be so.\n\nGood night to every one; and, noble signior,\n\nIf virtue no delighted beauty lack,\n\nYour son-in-law is far more fair than black. [290]\n\nFIRST SENATOR. Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.\n\nBRABANTIO. Look to her, Moor, have a quick eye to see:\n\nShe has deceiv’d her father, may do thee.\n\n(Exeunt Duke, Senators, Officers, etc.)\n\nOTHELLO. My life upon her faith: honest Iago,\n\nMy Desdemona must I leave to thee; [295]\n\n I prithee , let thy wife attend on her,\n\nAnd bring her after in the best advantage ;\n\nCome, Desdemona, I have but an hour\n\nOf love, of worldly matters, and direction,\n\nTo spend with thee; we must obey the time. [300]\n\n(Exeunt Othello and Desdemona.)\n\nRODERIGO. Iago!\n\nIAGO. What sayest thou, noble heart?\n\nRODERIGO. What will I do, thinkest thou?\n\nIAGO. Why, go to bed and sleep.\n\nRODERIGO. I will incontinently  drown myself . [305]\n\nIAGO. Well, if thou doest, I shall never love thee after it. Why, thou silly gentleman?\n\nRODERIGO. It is silliness to live, when to live is a torment ; and then we have a prescription to die, when death is our physician . [310]\n\nIAGO. O villainous ! I ha’ look’d upon the world for four times seven years, and since I could distinguish between a benefit and an injury , I never found a man that knew how to love himself: ere  I would say I would drown myself, for the love of a guinea-hen , [315] I would change my humanity with a baboon .\n\nRODERIGO. What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not in my virtue to amend it.\n\nIAGO. Virtue? a fig! ’tis in ourselves, that we are thus, [320] or thus: our bodies are gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners, so that if we will plant nettle s , or sow lettuce, set hyssop , and weed up  thyme ; supply it with one gender of herbs , or distract it with many; either to have it sterile with idleness, or manur’d  [325] with industry , why, the power, and corrigible authority of this, lies in our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason, to poise another of sensuality , the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous [330] conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal  sting s , our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you call love, to be a sect , or scion .\n\nRODERIGO. It cannot be.\n\nIAGO. It is merely a lust of the blood, and a permission [335] of the will. Come, be a man; drown thyself? drown cats and blind puppies : I profess me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving , with cables of perdurable toughness; I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow these [340] wars, defeat thy favour with an usurp’d beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love unto the Moor, ... put money in thy purse, ... nor he to her; it was a ­violent commencement , and thou shalt see an [345] answerable sequestration : put but money in thy purse ... These Moors are changeable in their wills: ... fill thy purse with money. The food that to him now is as luscious  as locust s , shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida . When she is sated with [350] his body, she will find the error of her choice; she must have change, she must. Therefore put money in thy purse: if thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning; make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony , and a frail  vow , [355] betwixt an erring barbarian, and a super-subtle Venetian, be not too hard for my wits, and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money, ... a pox o’ drowning, ’tis clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be hang’d in [360] compassing thy joy, than to be drown’d, and go without her.\n\nRODERIGO. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes?\n\nIAGO. Thou art sure of me ... go, make money ... I have told thee often, and I tell thee again, and again, I [365] hate the Moor; my cause is hearted, thine has no less reason, let us be communicative in our revenge against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou doest thyself a pleasure, and me a sport . There are many events in the womb of time, which will be [370]  deliver ed .  Traverse , go, provide thy money, we will have more of this tomorrow; adieu.\n\nRODERIGO. Where shall we meet i’ the morning?\n\nIAGO. At my lodging.\n\nRODERIGO. I’ll be with thee betimes . [375]\n\nIAGO. Go to, farewell: ... do you hear, Roderigo?\n\nRODERIGO. What say you?\n\nIAGO. No more of drowning, do you hear?\n\nRODERIGO. I am chang’d.\n\nIAGO. Go to; farewell! put money enough in your [380] purse.\n\n(Exit Roderigo.)\n\nThus do I ever make my fool my purse:\n\nFor I mine own gain’d knowledge should profane ,\n\nIf I would time expend with such a snipe ,\n\nBut for my sport and profit: I hate the Moor, [385]\n\nAnd it is thought abroad , that ’twixt my sheets\n\nHe’s done my office ; I know not if ’t be true ...\n\nYet I, for mere suspicion in that kind,\n\nWill do, as if for surety : he holds me well,\n\nThe better shall my purpose work on him. [390]\n\nCassio’s a proper man, let me see now,\n\nTo get this place, and to make up my will,\n\nA double knavery ... how, how? ... let me see,\n\nAfter some time, to abuse Othello’s ear,\n\nThat he is too familiar with his wife: [395]\n\nHe has a person and a smooth dispose ,\n\nTo be suspected , fram’d to make women false:\n\nThe Moor a free and open nature too,\n\nThat thinks men honest that but seem to be so:\n\nAnd will as tenderly be led by the nose ... [400]\n\nAs asses are.\n\nI ha’t, it is engender ’d ; Hell and night\n\nMust bring this monstrous birth to the world’s light.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nAct II\n\nScene 1\n\nA Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the Quay.\n\nEnter Montano, with two other Gentlemen.\n\nMONTANO. What from the cape can you discern at sea?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN. Nothing at all, it is a high-wrought flood,\n\nI cannot ’twixt the heaven and the main\n\n Descry  a sail.\n\nMONTANO. Methinks the wind does speak aloud at land, [5]\n\nA fuller blast ne’er shook our battlements :\n\nIf it ha’ ruffian ’d so upon the sea,\n\nWhat ribs of oak , when the huge mountains melt ,\n\nCan hold the mortise ? ... What shall we hear of this?\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN. A segregation of the Turkish fleet: [10]\n\nFor do but stand upon the banning shore,\n\nThe chiding  billow seems to pelt the clouds,\n\nThe wind-shak’d surge , with high and monstrous main,\n\nSeems to cast water on the burning bear ,\n\nAnd quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole ; [15]\n\nI never did like molestation view\n\nOn the enchafed flood.\n\nMONTANO.    If that the Turkish fleet\n\nBe not enshelter’d , and embay’d , they are drown’d,\n\nIt is impossible they bear it out.\n\n(Enter a third Gentleman.)\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN. News, lords, your wars are done: [20]\n\nThe desperate  tempest hath so bang ’d the Turk,\n\nThat their designment halts: another ship, of Venice,\n\nHath seen a grievous  wrack and sufferance\n\nOn most part of the fleet.\n\nMONTANO. How, is this true?\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.    The ship is here put in, [25]\n\nA Veronesa ; Michael Cassio,\n\nLieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,\n\nIs come ashore: the Moor himself at sea,\n\nAnd is in full commission here for Cyprus.\n\nMONTANO. I am glad on ’t, ’tis a worthy governor. [30]\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN. But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort,\n\nTouching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,\n\nAnd prays the Moor be safe, for they were parted,\n\nWith foul and violent tempest.\n\nMONTANO.    Pray heaven he be:\n\nFor I have serv’d him, and the man commands [35]\n\nLike a full soldier: let’s to the seaside, ho!\n\nAs well to see the vessel that’s come in,\n\nAs to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,\n\nEven till we make the main and the aerial blue\n\nAn indistinct regard.\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN.    Come, let’s do so, [40]\n\nFor every minute is expectancy\n\nOf more arrivance .\n\n(Enter Cassio.)\n\nCASSIO. Thanks to the valiant of this worthy isle,\n\nThat so approve the Moor, and let the heavens\n\nGive him defence against their elements, [45]\n\nFor I have lost him on a dangerous sea.\n\nMONTANO. Is he well shipp’d?\n\nCASSIO. His bark is stoutly  timber ’d , and his pilot\n\nOf very expert and approv’d allowance,\n\nTherefore my hopes, not surfeited to death, [50]\n\nStand in bold cure .\n\n(Within:  “A sail, a sail, a sail!”)\n\n(Enter a Messenger.)\n\nCASSIO. What noise?\n\nMESSENGER. The town is empty, on the brow o’ the sea\n\nStand ranks of people, and they cry “A sail!”\n\nCASSIO. My hopes do shape him for the governor. [55]\n\n(A shot.)\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN. They do discharge the shot of courtesy ,\n\nOur friend at least.\n\nCASSIO.    I pray you sir go forth,\n\nAnd give us truth, who ’tis that is arriv’d.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN. I shall.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nMONTANO. But, good lieutenant, is your general wiv’d ? [60]\n\nCASSIO. Most fortunately, he hath achiev’d a maid\n\nThat paragon s description, and wild fame :\n\nOne that excels the quirk s of blazon ing pens,\n\nAnd in the essential vesture  of creation\n\nDoes bear all excellency: ...\n\n(Enter Second Gentleman.)\n\nNow, who has put in? [65]\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN. ’Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.\n\nCASSIO. He has had most favourable and happy speed :\n\nTempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,\n\nThe gutter’d rocks, and congregated sands,\n\n Traitor s  ensteep’d , to clog the guiltless  keel , [70]\n\nAs having sense of beauty, do omit\n\nTheir common natures, letting go safely by\n\nThe divine Desdemona.\n\nMONTANO.    What is she?\n\nCASSIO. She that I spoke of, our great captain’s captain,\n\nLeft in the conduct of the bold Iago; [75]\n\nWhose footing here anticipate s our thoughts\n\nA se’nnight’s speed ... Great Jove , Othello guard,\n\nAnd swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,\n\nThat he may bless this bay with his tall ship,\n\nAnd swiftly come to Desdemona’s arms, [80]\n\n(Enter Desdemona, Iago, Emilia, and Roderigo.)\n\nGive renew’d fire to our extincted spirits,\n\nAnd bring all Cyprus comfort, ...\n\nO, behold ,\n\nThe riches of the ship is come ashore!\n\nYe men of Cyprus, let her have your knees:\n\nHail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven, [85]\n\nBefore, behind thee, and on every hand,\n\n Enwheel thee round!\n\nDESDEMONA.    I thank you, valiant Cassio:\n\nWhat tidings can you tell me of my lord?\n\nCASSIO. He is not yet arriv’d, nor know I aught,\n\nBut that he’s well, and will be shortly here. [90]\n\nDESDEMONA. O, but I fear: ... how lost you company?\n\n(Within: “A sail, a sail!”)\n\nCASSIO. The great contention of the sea and skies\n\nParted our fellowship: but, hark ! a sail.\n\n(A shot.)\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN. They give their greeting to the citadel,\n\nThis likewise is a friend.\n\nCASSIO.    So speaks this voice. [95]\n\nGood ancient, you are welcome, (to Emilia) welcome, mistress:\n\nLet it not gall your patience, good Iago,\n\nThat I extend my manners; ’tis my breeding\n\nThat gives me this bold show of courtesy.\n\n(Kissing her.)\n\nIAGO. Sir, would she give you so much of her lips [100]\n\nAs of her tongue she has bestow’d on me,\n\nYou’ld have enough.\n\nDESDEMONA. Alas ! she has no speech.\n\nIAGO. I know, too much:\n\nI find it, I; for when I ha’ list to sleep –\n\n Marry , before your ladyship, I grant , [105]\n\nShe puts her tongue a little in her heart,\n\nAnd chides with thinking.\n\nEMILIA. You ha’ little cause to say so.\n\nIAGO. Come on, come on, you are pictures out o’ doors;\n\nBells in your parlour s ; wild-cats in your kitchens; [110]\n\nSaints in your injuries; devils being offended;\n\nPlayers in your housewifery ; and housewives in your beds.\n\nDESDEMONA. O, fie upon thee, slanderer !\n\nIAGO. Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk,\n\nYou rise to play, and go to bed to work. [115]\n\nEMILIA. You shall not write my praise.\n\nIAGO.    No, let me not.\n\nDESDEMONA. What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me?\n\nIAGO. O gentle lady, do not put me to ’t,\n\nFor I am nothing, if not critical.\n\nDESDEMONA. Come on, assay ... there’s one gone to the harbour? [120]\n\nIAGO. Ay, madam.\n\nDESDEMONA. I am not merry, but I do beguile\n\nThe thing I am, by seeming otherwise:\n\nCome, how wouldst thou praise me?\n\nIAGO. I am about it, but indeed my invention [125]\n\nComes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze ,\n\nIt plucks out brain and all: but my Muse labour s ,\n\nAnd thus she is deliver’d:\n\nIf she be fair and wise, fairness and wit;\n\nThe one’s for use, the other using it. [130]\n\nDESDEMONA. Well prais’d! How if she be black and witty?\n\nIAGO. If she be black, and thereto have a wit,\n\nShe’ll find a white, that shall her blackness hit.\n\nDESDEMONA. Worse and worse.\n\nEMILIA. How if fair and foolish? [135]\n\nIAGO. She never yet was foolish, that was fair,\n\nFor even her folly help’d her, to an heir.\n\nDESDEMONA. These are old paradoxes, to make fools laugh i’ the alehouse ; what miserable praise hast thou for her that’s foul and foolish? [140]\n\nIAGO. There’s none so foul, and foolish thereunto,\n\nBut does foul prank s , which fair and wise ones do.\n\nDESDEMONA. O heavy ignorance, that praises the worst best: but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed? one that in the [145] authority of her merit s did justly put on the vouch of very malice  itself?\n\nIAGO. She that was ever fair, and never proud,\n\nHad tongue at will, and yet was never loud,\n\nNever lack’d gold, and yet went never gay, [150]\n\n Fled from her wish, and yet said “Now I may;”\n\nShe that, being anger’d, her revenge being nigh ,\n\nBade her wrong stay, and her displeasure fly;\n\nShe that in wisdom never was so frail\n\nTo change the cod ’s head for the salmon ’s tail; [155]\n\nShe that could think, and ne’er disclose her mind,\n\nSee suitor s following, and not look behind;\n\nShe was a wight , if ever such wight were –\n\nDESDEMONA. To do what?\n\nIAGO. To suckle fools, and chronicle  small beer . [160]\n\nDESDEMONA. O most lame and impotent conclusion: do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband; how say you, Cassio, is he not a most profane and liberal  counsellor ?\n\nCASSIO. He speaks home , madam, you may relish him [165] more in the soldier than in the scholar.\n\nIAGO (aside). He takes her by the palm ; ay, well said, whisper: as little a web as this will ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do: I will catch you in your own courtesies: you say true, ’tis so indeed. If [170] such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry , it had been better you had not kiss’d your three fingers so oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in: good, well kiss’d, an excellent courtesy; ’tis so indeed: yet again, your fingers at your [175] lips? would they were clyster-pipe s for your sake ... (Trumpets within.) The Moor, I know his trumpet.\n\nCASSIO. ’Tis truly so.\n\nDESDEMONA. Let’s meet him, and receive him.\n\n(Enter Othello and Attendants.)\n\nCASSIO. Lo , where he comes! [180]\n\nOTHELLO. O my fair warrior!\n\nDESDEMONA.    My dear Othello!\n\nOTHELLO. It gives me wonder great as my content\n\nTo see you here before me: O my soul’s joy,\n\nIf after every tempest come such calmness,\n\nMay the winds blow, till they have waken’d death, [185]\n\nAnd let the labouring bark climb hills of seas,\n\n Olympus-high , and duck again as low\n\nAs hell’s from heaven. If it were now to die,\n\n’Twere now to be most happy, for I fear\n\nMy soul hath her content so absolute, [190]\n\nThat not another comfort, like to this\n\nSucceeds in unknown fate.\n\nDESDEMONA.    The heavens forbid\n\nBut that our loves and comforts should increase,\n\nEven as our days do grow.\n\nOTHELLO.    Amen to that, sweet powers!\n\nI cannot speak enough of this content, [195]\n\nIt stops me here, it is too much of joy:\n\nAnd this, and this, the greatest discord be\n\n(They kiss.)\n\nThat e’er our hearts shall make!\n\nIAGO (aside). O, you are well tun’d now,\n\nBut I’ll set down the peg s that make this music,\n\nAs honest as I am.\n\nOTHELLO.    Come, let us to the castle. [200]\n\nNews, friends, our wars are done, the Turks are drown’d\n\nHow do our old acquaintance of the isle?\n\n Honey , you shall be well desir’d in Cyprus;\n\nI have found great love amongst them: O my sweet,\n\nI prattle out of fashion, and I dote [205]\n\nIn mine own comforts: I prithee, good Iago,\n\nGo to the bay, and disembark my coffer s ;\n\nBring thou the master to the citadel;\n\nHe is a good one, and his worthiness\n\nDoes challenge much respect: come, Desdemona, [210]\n\nOnce more well met at Cyprus.\n\n(Exeunt all but Iago and Roderigo.)\n\nIAGO. Do thou meet me presently at the harbour: come hither. If thou be’st valiant – as, they say, base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them – list me; the [215] lieutenant to-night watches on the court of guard: first, I will tell thee this, Desdemona is directly in love with him.\n\nRODERIGO. With him? why, ’tis not possible.\n\nIAGO. Lay thy finger thus , and let thy soul be [220] instructed: mark me, with what violence she first lov’d the Moor, but for bragging , and telling her fantastical lies; and will she love him still for prating? let not the discreet heart think so. Her eye must be fed, and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? [225] When the blood is made dull with the act of sport , there should be again to inflame it, and give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour, sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which the Moor is defective in : now, for want of these requir’d [230]  convenience s , her delicate tenderness will find itself abus’d, begin to heave the gorge , disrelish and abhor the Moor, very nature will instruct her to it, and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and unforc’d position) who [235] stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? a knave very voluble , no farther conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing of his salt and hidden affection s : a subtle  slippery  [240] knave, a finder out of occasions; that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit the true advantages never present themselves. Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after; a pestilent  complete [245] knave, and the woman has found him already.\n\nRODERIGO. I cannot believe that in her, she’s full of most blest condition.\n\nIAGO. Blest fig’s-end ! the wine she drinks is made of grapes: if she had been blest, she would never have [250] lov’d the Moor. Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand?\n\nRODERIGO. Yes, but that was but courtesy.\n\nIAGO. Lechery , by this hand : an index and prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts: they met so [255] near with their lips, that their breaths embrac’d together. When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the main exercise, the incorporate conclusion. But, sir, be you rul’d by me, I have brought you from Venice: watch you to-night, for [260] your command, I’ll lay ’t upon you, Cassio knows you not, I’ll not be far from you, do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other cause you please; which the time shall more [265] favourably minister .\n\nRODERIGO. Well.\n\nIAGO. Sir, he is rash , and very sudden in choler , and haply with his truncheon may strike at you: provoke him that he may, for even out of that will I cause [270] these of Cyprus to mutiny , whose qualification shall come into no true trust again, but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them, and the impediment most profitably [275] remov’d, without which there were no expectation of our prosperity .\n\nRODERIGO. I will do this, if I can bring it to any opportunity.\n\nIAGO. I warrant thee, meet me by and by at the citadel: [280] I must fetch his necessaries ashore ... Farewell.\n\nRODERIGO. Adieu.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nIAGO. That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;\n\nThat she loves him, ’tis apt and of great credit:\n\nThe Moor, howbe’t that I endure him not, [285]\n\nIs of a constant, noble, loving nature;\n\nAnd I dare think, he’ll prove to Desdemona\n\nA most dear husband: now I do love her too,\n\nNot out of absolute lust, (though peradventure\n\nI stand accountant for as great a sin) [290]\n\nBut partly led to diet my revenge,\n\nFor that I do suspect the lustful Moor\n\nHath leap’d into my seat, the thought whereof\n\nDoth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards ,\n\nAnd nothing can, nor shall content my soul, [295]\n\nTill I am even with him, wife, for wife:\n\nOr failing so, yet that I put the Moor,\n\nAt least, into a jealousy so strong,\n\nThat judgement cannot cure; which thing to do,\n\nIf this poor trash  of Venice, whom I trash  [300]\n\nFor his quick hunting, stand the putting on ,\n\nI’ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip ,\n\nAbuse him to the Moor, in the rank garb\n\n(For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too)\n\nMake the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me, [305]\n\nFor making him egregiously an ass,\n\nAnd practising upon his peace and quiet,\n\nEven to madness: ’tis here, but yet confus’d;\n\nKnavery’s plain face is never seen, till us’d.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nScene 2\n\nThe same.\n\nEnter Othello’s Herald reading a proclamation.\n\nHERALD. It is Othello’s pleasure; our noble and valiant general, that upon certain tidings now arrived, import ing the mere  perdition of the Turkish fleet; that every man put himself into triumph: some to dance, some make bonfire s ; each man to what sport [5] and revel s his mind leads him; for besides these beneficial news, it is the celebration of his nuptials . So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full liberty, from this present hour of five, till the bell hath told eleven. [10] Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus, and our noble general Othello!\n\n(Exit.)\n\nScene 3\n\nA Hall in the Castle.\n\nEnter Othello, Cassio, and Desdemona.\n\nOTHELLO. Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:\n\nLet’s teach ourselves the honourable stop ,\n\nNot to outsport  discretion .\n\nCASSIO. Iago hath directed what to do:\n\nBut notwithstanding  with my personal eye [5]\n\nWill I look to it.\n\nOTHELLO.    Iago is most honest,\n\nMichael, good night, to-morrow with your earliest,\n\nLet me have speech with you; come, my dear love,\n\nThe purchase made, the fruits are to ensue ,\n\nThe profit’s yet to come ’twixt me and you. [10]\n\nGood night.\n\n(Exeunt Othello and Desdemona.)\n\n(Enter Iago . )\n\nCASSIO. Welcome, Iago, we must to the watch.\n\nIAGO. Not this hour, lieutenant, ’tis not yet ten o’ clock: our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona, who let us not therefore blame : [15] he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and she is sport for Jove.\n\nCASSIO. She is a most exquisite lady.\n\nIAGO. And I’ll warrant her full of game .\n\nCASSIO. Indeed she is a most fresh and delicate creature. [20]\n\nIAGO. What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of provocation.\n\nCASSIO. An inviting eye, and yet methinks right modest.\n\nIAGO. And when she speaks, ’tis an alarm to love.\n\nCASSIO. She is indeed perfection. [25]\n\nIAGO. Well, happiness to their sheets! ... Come, lieutenant, I have a stoup of wine, and here without are a brace  of Cyprus gallant s , that would fain have a measure to the health of the black Othello.\n\nCASSIO. Not to-night, good Iago; I have very poor and [30] unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment .\n\nIAGO. O, they are our friends, ... but one cup: I’ll drink for you. [35]\n\nCASSIO. I ha’ drunk but one cup to-night, and that was craftily  qualified too, and behold what innovation it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity , and dare not task my weakness with any more.\n\nIAGO. What, man, ’tis a night of revels, the gallants [40] desire it.\n\nCASSIO. Where are they?\n\nIAGO. Here at the door, I pray you call them in.\n\nCASSIO. I’ll do’t, but it dislikes me.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nIAGO. If I can fasten but one cup upon him, [45]\n\nWith that which he hath drunk to-night already,\n\nHe’ll be as full of quarrel and offence\n\nAs my young mistress’ dog: ... Now my sick fool Roderigo,\n\nWhom love has turn’d almost the wrong side outward,\n\nTo Desdemona hath to-night carous’d  [50]\n\n Potation s  pottle-deep , and he’s to watch:\n\nThree lad s of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,\n\nThat hold their honour in a wary distance,\n\nThe very elements of this warlike isle,\n\nHave I to-night fluster ’d with flowing cups, [55]\n\nAnd they watch too: now, ’mongst this flock of drunkard s ,\n\nI am to put our Cassio in some action\n\nThat may offend the isle.\n\n(Enter Montano, Cassio, and others.)\n\nBut here they come:\n\nIf consequence do but approve my dream,\n\nMy boat sails freely, both with wind and stream. [60]\n\nCASSIO. ’Fore God they have given me a rouse already.\n\nMONTANO. Good faith, a little one, not past a pint ,\n\nAs I am a soldier.\n\nIAGO. Some wine, ho!\n\n(Sings.)\n\nAnd let me the cannikin clink, clink, [65]\n\nAnd let me the cannikin clink, clink:\n\nA soldier’s a man,\n\nA life’s but a span ,\n\nWhy then let a soldier drink.\n\nSome wine, boys! [70]\n\nCASSIO. ’Fore God an excellent song.\n\nIAGO. I learn’d it in England, where indeed they are most potent in potting : your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander, – drink, ho! – are nothing to your English. [75]\n\nCASSIO. Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?\n\nIAGO. Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain ; he gives your Hollander a vomit  ere the next pottle can be fill’d. [80]\n\nCASSIO. To the health of our general!\n\nMONTANO. I am for it, lieutenant, and I will do you justice.\n\nIAGO. O sweet England!\n\n(Sings.)\n\nKing Stephen was a worthy peer ,\n\nHis breeches cost him but a crown; [85]\n\nHe held ’em sixpence all too dear,\n\nWith that he call’d the tailor  lown ,\n\nHe was a wight of high renown ,\n\nAnd thou art but of low degree,\n\n’Tis pride that pulls the country down, [90]\n\nThen take thine owd cloak about thee .\n\nSome wine, ho!\n\nCASSIO. ’Fore God this is a more exquisite song than the other.\n\nIAGO. Will you hear’t again?\n\nCASSIO. No, for I hold him unworthy of his place, that [95] does those things: well, God’s above all, and there be souls that must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.\n\nIAGO. It is true, good lieutenant.\n\nCASSIO. For mine own part, no offence to the general, [100] nor any man of quality, I hope to be saved.\n\nIAGO. And so do I, lieutenant.\n\nCASSIO. Ay, but by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let’s ha’ no more of this, let’s to our affairs: God forgive us our [105] sins! Gentlemen, let’s look to our business. Do not think gentlemen I am drunk, this is my ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my left hand: I am not drunk now, I can stand well enough, and speak well enough. [110]\n\nALL. Excellent well.\n\nCASSIO. Very well then; you must not think, that I am drunk.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nMONTANO. To the platform , masters. Come, let’s set the watch.\n\nIAGO. You see this fellow that is gone before, [115]\n\nHe is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar,\n\nAnd give direction: and do but see his vice,\n\n’Tis to his virtue a just equinox ,\n\nThe one as long as th’ other: ’tis pity of him,\n\nI fear the trust Othello put him in, [120]\n\nOn some odd time of his infirmity,\n\nWill shake this island.\n\nMONTANO.    But is he often thus?\n\nIAGO. ’Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:\n\nHe’ll watch the horologe a double set,\n\nIf drink rock not his cradle .\n\nMONTANO.    ’Twere well [125]\n\nThe general were put in mind of it;\n\nPerhaps he sees it not, or his good nature\n\nPraises the virtues that appear in Cassio,\n\nAnd looks not on his evils: is not this true?\n\n(Enter Roderigo.)\n\nIAGO (aside to him). How now, Roderigo, [130]\n\nI pray you, after the lieutenant, go.\n\n(Exit Roderigo.)\n\nMONTANO. And ’tis great pity that the noble Moor\n\nShould hazard such a place as his own second\n\nWith one of an ingraft infirmity:\n\nIt were an honest action to say so [135]\n\nTo the Moor.\n\nIAGO.    Not I, for this fair island:\n\nI do love Cassio well, and would do much\n\n(Cry within: “Help! help!”)\n\nTo cure him of this evil: – but hark, what noise?\n\n(Enter Cassio, driving in Roderigo.)\n\nCASSIO. Zounds, you rogue , you rascal !\n\nMONTANO. What’s the matter, lieutenant? [140]\n\nCASSIO. A knave, teach me my duty! But I’ll beat the knave into a wicker bottle.\n\nRODERIGO. Beat me?\n\nCASSIO. Dost thou prate, rogue?\n\n(Striking Roderigo.)\n\nMONTANO. Good lieutenant; pray sir, hold your hand. [145]\n\nCASSIO. Let me go, sir, or I’ll knock you o’er the mazzard .\n\nMONTANO. Come, come, you are drunk.\n\nCASSIO. Drunk?\n\n(They fight.)\n\nIAGO (aside to Roderigo). Away I say, go out and cry a mutiny.\n\n(Exit Roderigo.)\n\nNay, good lieutenant: God’s will, gentlemen, [150]\n\nHelp, ho! – Lieutenant: – sir, – Montano, – sir, –\n\nHelp, masters, here’s a goodly watch indeed,\n\n(A bell rings.)\n\nWho’s that that rings the bell? – Diablo ... ho,\n\nThe town will rise, God’s will, lieutenant, hold,\n\nYou will be sham’d for ever. [155]\n\n(Enter Othello, and Gentlemen with weapons.)\n\nOTHELLO. What is the matter here?\n\nMONTANO.    Zounds, I bleed still,\n\nI am hurt, to the death.\n\nOTHELLO.    Hold, for your lives!\n\nIAGO.        Hold, hold,\n\nLieutenant, – sir, – Montano, – gentlemen, –\n\nHave you forgot all place of sense, and duty?\n\nHold, the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame! [160]\n\nOTHELLO. Why, how now, ho! from whence arises this?\n\nAre we turn’d Turks , and to ourselves do that\n\nWhich heaven has forbid the Ottomites?\n\nFor Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl ;\n\nHe that stirs next, to carve for his own rage, [165]\n\nHolds his soul light, he dies upon his motion;\n\nSilence that dreadful bell, it fright s the isle\n\nFrom her propriety : what’s the matter, masters?\n\nHonest Iago, that looks dead with grieving ,\n\nSpeak, who began this? on thy love I charge thee. [170]\n\nIAGO. I do not know, friends all but now, even now,\n\nIn quarter , and in terms , like bride and groom,\n\n Devest ing them to bed, and then but now,\n\nAs if some planet had unwit ted men,\n\nSwords out, and tilt ing one at other’s breast, [175]\n\nIn opposition bloody. I cannot speak\n\nAny beginning to this peevish odds;\n\nAnd would in action glorious I had lost\n\nThese legs, that brought me to a part of it!\n\nOTHELLO. How came it, Michael, you were thus forgot? [180]\n\nCASSIO. I pray you pardon me, I cannot speak.\n\nOTHELLO. Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil,\n\nThe gravity and stillness of your youth\n\nThe world hath noted, and your name is great\n\nIn mouths of wisest censure : what’s the matter, [185]\n\nThat you unlace your reputation thus,\n\nAnd spend your rich opinion, for the name\n\nOf a night-brawler ? Give me answer to ’t.\n\nMONTANO. Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger,\n\nYour officer Iago can inform you – [190]\n\nWhile I spare speech, which something now offends me –\n\nOf all that I do know; nor know I aught\n\nBy me that’s said or done amiss this night,\n\nUnless self-charity be sometime a vice,\n\nAnd to defend ourselves it be a sin [195]\n\nWhen violence assails us.\n\nOTHELLO.    Now by heaven\n\nMy blood begins my safer guides to rule,\n\nAnd passion having my best judgement collied\n\nAssays to lead the way. Zounds, if I stir,\n\nOr do but lift this arm, the best of you [200]\n\nShall sink in my rebuke : give me to know\n\nHow this foul rout began, who set it on,\n\nAnd he that is approv’d in this offence,\n\nThough he had twinn’d with me, both at a birth,\n\nShall lose me: what, in a town of war, [205]\n\nYet wild, the people’s hearts brim full of fear,\n\nTo manage private and domestic quarrels,\n\nIn night, and on the court and guard of safety?\n\n’Tis monstrous. Iago, who began?\n\nMONTANO. If partially affin’d , or leagu’d in office, [210]\n\nThou dost deliver more or less than truth,\n\nThou art no soldier.\n\nIAGO.    Touch me not so near,\n\nI had rather ha’ this tongue cut from my mouth,\n\nThan it should do offence to Michael Cassio:\n\nYet I persuade myself, to speak the truth [215]\n\nShall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general:\n\nMontano and myself being in speech,\n\nThere comes a fellow, crying out for help,\n\nAnd Cassio following him with determin’d sword,\n\nTo execute upon him: sir, this gentleman [220]\n\nSteps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause;\n\nMyself the crying fellow did pursue ,\n\n Lest by his clamour (as it so fell out)\n\nThe town might fall in fright : he, swift of foot,\n\nOutran my purpose: and I return’d the rather, [225]\n\nFor that I heard the clink and fall of swords;\n\nAnd Cassio high in oaths , which till to-night\n\nI ne’er might see before: when I came back\n\n(For this was brief ) I found them close together,\n\nAt blow and thrust , even as again they were, [230]\n\nWhen you yourself did part them.\n\nMore of this matter can I not report,\n\nBut men are men, the best sometimes forget;\n\nThough Cassio did some little wrong to him,\n\nAs men in rage strike those that wish them best, [235]\n\nYet surely Cassio, I believe, receiv’d,\n\nFrom him that fled, some strange indignity ,\n\nWhich patience could not pass.\n\nOTHELLO.    I know, Iago,\n\nThy honesty and love doth mince this matter,\n\nMaking it light to Cassio: Cassio, I love thee, [240]\n\nBut never more be officer of mine.\n\n(Enter Desdemona, with others.)\n\nLook if my gentle love be not rais’d up!\n\nI’ll make thee an example.\n\nDESDEMONA. What is the matter?\n\nOTHELLO. All’s well now, sweeting ; come away to bed: [245]\n\nSir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon ;\n\nLead him off.\n\n(Montano is led off.)\n\nIago, look with care about the town,\n\nAnd silence those whom this vile brawl distract ed .\n\nCome, Desdemona: ’tis the soldier’s life, [250]\n\nTo have their balmy  slumber s wak’d with strife .\n\n(Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio.)\n\nIAGO. What, are you hurt, lieutenant?\n\nCASSIO. Ay, past all surgery .\n\nIAGO. Marry, God forbid!\n\nCASSIO. Reputation, reputation, I ha’ lost my [255] reputation! I ha’ lost the immortal part, sir, of myself, and what remains is bestial; my reputation, Iago, my reputation!\n\nIAGO. As I am an honest man, I thought you had receiv’d some bodily wound, there is more offence [260] in that than in reputation: reputation is an idle and most false imposition , oft got without merit, and lost without deserving. You have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser; what man, there are ways to recover the general again: [265] you are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice, even so, as one would beat his offenceless dog, to affright an imperious lion: sue to him again, and he’s yours.\n\nCASSIO. I will rather sue to be despis’d, than to deceive [270] so good a commander, with so light , so drunken, and indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot ? and squabble ? swagger ? swear? and discourse  fustian with one’s own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us [275] call thee devil!\n\nIAGO. What was he, that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you?\n\nCASSIO. I know not.\n\nIAGO. Is ’t possible? [280]\n\nCASSIO. I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths, to steal away their brains; that we should with joy, revel, pleasure, and applause, transform ourselves into [285] beasts!\n\nIAGO. Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus recover ed ?\n\nCASSIO. It hath pleas’d the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath ; one unperfectness shows [290] me another, to make me frankly despise myself.\n\nIAGO. Come, you are too severe a moraler ; as the time, the place, the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not so befall en ; but since it is as it is, mend it, for your own good. [295]\n\nCASSIO.  I will ask him for my place again, he shall tell me I am a drunkard: had I as many mouths as Hydra , such an answer would stop ’em all: to be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! Every unordinate cup is unbless’d, and the [300]  ingredience is a devil.\n\nIAGO. Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well us’d; exclaim no more against it; and, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.\n\nCASSIO. I have well approv’d it, sir, ... I drunk! [305]\n\nIAGO. You, or any man living, may be drunk at some time: I’ll tell you what you shall do ... Our general’s wife is now the general; I may say so in this respect, for that he has devoted and given up himself to the contemplation , mark and denotement of her parts [310] and grace s . Confess yourself freely to her, importune her she’ll help to put you in your place again: she is so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition , that she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This brawl between [315] you and her husband, entreat her to splinter , and my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than ’twas before.\n\nCASSIO. You advise me well. [320]\n\nIAGO. I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.\n\nCASSIO. I think it freely, and betimes in the morning will I beseech the virtuous Desdemona, to undertake for me; I am desperate of my fortunes, if they [325] check me here.\n\nIAGO. You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I must to the watch.\n\nCASSIO. Good night, honest Iago.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nIAGO. And what’s he then, that says I play the villain,\n\nWhen this advice is free I give, and honest, [330]\n\n Probal to thinking , and indeed the course\n\nTo win the Moor again? For ’tis most easy\n\nThe inclining Desdemona to subdue,\n\nIn any honest suit; she’s fram’d as fruitful\n\nAs the free elements: and then for her [335]\n\n To win the Moor, were ’t to renounce his baptism ,\n\nAll seal s and symbols of redeemed sin,\n\nHis soul is so infetter’d to her love,\n\nThat she may make, unmake, do what she list,\n\nEven as her appetite shall play the god [340]\n\nWith his weak  function . How am I then a villain,\n\nTo counsel Cassio to this parallel course,\n\nDirectly to his good? Divinity of hell!\n\nWhen devils will their blackest sins put on,\n\nThey do suggest at first with heavenly shows, [345]\n\nAs I do now: for while this honest fool\n\n Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes,\n\nAnd she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,\n\nI’ll pour this pestilence into his ear,\n\nThat she repeals him for her body’s lust; [350]\n\nAnd by how much she strives to do him good,\n\nShe shall undo her credit with the Moor;\n\nSo will I turn her virtue into pitch ,\n\nAnd out of her own goodness make the net\n\nThat shall enmesh ’em all.\n\n(Enter Roderigo.)\n\nHow now, Roderigo? [355]\n\nRODERIGO. I do follow here in the chase , not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry: my money is almost spent, I ha’ been to-night exceedingly well cudgel’d : I think the issue will be, I shall have so much experience for my pain s , as that comes [360] to, and no money at all, and wit h that wit return to Venice.\n\nIAGO. How poor are they that ha’ not patience!\n\nWhat wound did ever heal, but by degrees?\n\nThou knowest we work by wit, and not by witchcraft, [365]\n\nAnd wit depends on dilatory time.\n\nDoes’t not go well? Cassio has beaten thee,\n\nAnd thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier ’d Cassio;\n\nThough other things grow fair against the sun,\n\nBut fruits that blossom first, will first be ripe; [370]\n\nContent thyself awhile; by the mass ’tis morning;\n\nPleasure, and action, make the hours seem short:\n\nRetire thee, go where thou art billeted ,\n\nAway I say, thou shalt know more hereafter:\n\nNay, get thee gone. (Exit Roderigo .) Some things are to be done, [375]\n\nMy wife must move for Cassio to her mistress,\n\nI’ll set her on.\n\nMyself awhile to draw the Moor apart,\n\nAnd bring him jump when he may Cassio find,\n\n Solicit ing his wife: ay, that’s the way, [380]\n\n Dull not device by coldness and delay.\n\n(Exit.)\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nAct III\n\nScene 1\n\nBefore the Castle.\n\nEnter Cassio, with Musicians and the Clown.\n\nCASSIO. Masters, play here, I will content your pains,\n\nSomething that’s brief, and bid “Good morrow, general.”\n\n(They play.)\n\nCLOWN. Why, masters, ha’ your instruments been at Naples , that they speak i’ the nose thus?\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN. How, sir, how? [5]\n\nCLOWN. Are these, I pray, call’d wind-instrument s ?\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN. Ay marry are they, sir.\n\nCLOWN. O, thereby hangs a tail.\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN. Whereby hangs a tale, sir?\n\nCLOWN. Marry, sir, by many a wind-instrument that I [10] know. But, masters, here’s money for you, and the general so likes your music, that he desires you, of all loves, to make no more noise with it.\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN. Well sir, we will not.\n\nCLOWN. If you have any music that may not be heard, [15] to ’t again, but, as they say, to hear music, the general does not greatly care.\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN. We ha’ none such, sir.\n\nCLOWN. Then put your pipes in your bag, for I’ll away; go, vanish away! [20]\n\n(Exeunt Musicians.)\n\nCASSIO. Dost thou hear my honest friend?\n\nCLOWN. No, I hear not your honest friend, I hear you.\n\nCASSIO. Prithee keep up thy quillets , there’s a poor piece of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends the general’s wife be stir ring , tell her there’s [25] one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech ... wilt thou do this?\n\nCLOWN. She is stirring, sir, if she will stir hither, I shall seem to notify unto her.\n\n(Enter Iago.)\n\nCASSIO. Do, good my friend.\n\n(Exit Clown.)\n\nIn happy time, Iago. [30]\n\nIAGO. You ha’ not been a-bed, then?\n\nCASSIO. Why no, the day had broke before we parted:\n\nI ha’ made bold , Iago,\n\nTo send in to your wife, ... my suit to her\n\nIs, that she will to virtuous Desdemona [35]\n\n Procure me some access .\n\nIAGO.    I’ll send her to you presently,\n\nAnd I’ll devise a mean to draw the Moor\n\nOut of the way, that your converse and business\n\nMay be more free.\n\nCASSIO. I humbly thank you for it. (Exit Iago.) I never knew [40]\n\nA Florentine more kind and honest.\n\n(Enter Emilia.)\n\nEMILIA. Good morrow, good lieutenant; I am sorry\n\nFor your displeasure, but all will soon be well,\n\nThe general and his wife are talking of it,\n\nAnd she speaks for you stoutly : the Moor replies, [45]\n\nThat he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,\n\nAnd great affinity , and that in wholesome wisdom\n\nHe might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you,\n\nAnd needs no other suitor but his likings\n\nTo take the safest occasion by the front, [50]\n\nTo bring you in again.\n\nCASSIO.    Yet I beseech you,\n\nIf you think fit , or that it may be done,\n\nGive me advantage of some brief discourse\n\nWith Desdemona alone.\n\nEMILIA.    Pray you, come in,\n\nI will bestow you where you shall have time [55]\n\nTo speak your bosom freely.\n\nCASSIO.    I am much bound to you.\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nScene 2\n\nThe same.\n\nEnter Othello, Iago, and other Gentlemen.\n\nOTHELLO. These letters give, Iago, to the pilot,\n\nAnd by him do my duties to the State:\n\nThat done, I will be walking on the works ,\n\n Repair there to me.\n\nIAGO.    Well, my good lord, I’ll do ’t.\n\nOTHELLO. This fortification , gentlemen, shall we see ’t? [5]\n\nGENTLEMEN . We wait upon your lordship.\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nScene 3\n\nThe same.\n\nEnter Desdemona, Cassio, and Emilia.\n\nDESDEMONA. Be thou assur’d , good Cassio, I will do\n\nAll my abilities in thy behalf .\n\nEMILIA. Good madam, do, I know it grieves my husband,\n\nAs if the case were his.\n\nDESDEMONA. O, that’s an honest fellow: ... do not doubt, Cassio, [5]\n\nBut I will have my lord and you again\n\nAs friendly as you were.\n\nCASSIO.    Bounteous madame,\n\nWhatever shall become of Michael Cassio,\n\nHe’s never anything but your true servant.\n\nDESDEMONA. O sir, I thank you; you do love my lord, [10]\n\nYou have known him long, and be you well assur’d,\n\nHe shall in strangest stand no farther off\n\nThan in a politic distance.\n\nCASSIO.    Ay, but, lady,\n\nThe policy may either last so long,\n\nOr feed upon such nice and wat’rish diet, [15]\n\nOr breed itself so out of circumstance,\n\nThat I being absent, and my place supplied,\n\nMy general will forget my love and service.\n\nDESDEMONA. Do not doubt that: before Emilia here\n\nI give thee warrant  of thy place; assure thee [20]\n\nIf I do vow a friendship, I’ll perform it\n\nTo the last article; my lord shall never rest,\n\nI’ll watch him tame , and talk him out of patience;\n\nHis bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift ,\n\nI’ll intermingle every thing he does [25]\n\nWith Cassio’s suit; therefore be merry, Cassio,\n\nFor thy solicitor shall rather die\n\nThan give thy cause away.\n\n(Enter Othello and Iago.)\n\nEMILIA. Madam, here comes my lord.\n\nCASSIO. Madam, I’ll take my leave. [30]\n\nDESDEMONA. Why, stay and hear me speak.\n\nCASSIO. Madam, not now, I am very ill at ease ,\n\nUnfit for mine own purpose.\n\nDESDEMONA. Well, do your discretion .\n\n(Exit Cassio.)\n\nIAGO. Ha, I like not that. [35]\n\nOTHELLO. What dost thou say?\n\nIAGO. Nothing, my lord, or if – I know not what.\n\nOTHELLO. Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?\n\nIAGO. Cassio, my lord? ... no, sure, I cannot think it,\n\nThat he would sneak away so guilty-like, [40]\n\nSeeing you coming.\n\nOTHELLO.    I do believe ’twas he.\n\nDESDEMONA. How now, my lord?\n\nI have been talking with a suitor here,\n\nA man that languish es in your displeasure.\n\nOTHELLO. Who is’t you mean? [45]\n\nDESDEMONA. Why, your lieutenant, Cassio, good my lord,\n\nIf I have any grace or power to move you,\n\nHis present reconciliation take:\n\nFor if he be not one that truly loves you,\n\nThat errs in ignorance, and not in cunning , [50]\n\nI have no judgement in an honest face,\n\nI prithee call him back.\n\nOTHELLO.    Went he hence now?\n\nDESDEMONA. Yes, faith, so humbled,\n\nThat he has left part of his griefs with me,\n\nI suffer with him; good love, call him back. [55]\n\nOTHELLO. Not now, sweet Desdemona, some other time.\n\nDESDEMONA. But shall ’t be shortly?\n\nOTHELLO.    The sooner, sweet, for you.\n\nDESDEMONA. Shall ’t be to-night at supper?\n\nOTHELLO.    No, not to-night.\n\nDESDEMONA. To-morrow dinner then?\n\nOTHELLO.    I shall not dine at home,\n\nI meet the captains, at the citadel. [60]\n\nDESDEMONA. Why then to-morrow night, or Tuesday morn,\n\nOn Tuesday noon, or night, or Wednesday morn:\n\nI prithee name the time, but let it not\n\nExceed three days: i’ faith, he’s penitent ,\n\nAnd yet his trespass , in our common reason, [65]\n\n(Save that, they say, the wars must make examples\n\nOut of their best) is not almost a fault\n\nTo incur a private check: when shall he come?\n\nTell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,\n\nWhat you could ask me, that I should deny ? [70]\n\nOr stand so mammer ing on? What? Michael Cassio,\n\nThat came a-wooing with you, and so many a time\n\nWhen I have spoke of you dispraisingly ,\n\nHath ta’en your part, to have so much to do\n\nTo bring him in? Byrlady , I could do much – [75]\n\nOTHELLO. Prithee no more, let him come when he will,\n\nI will deny thee nothing.\n\nDESDEMONA.    Why, this is not a boon ,\n\n’Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves;\n\nOr feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,\n\nOr sue to you, to do a peculiar profit [80]\n\nTo your own person: nay, when I have a suit\n\nWherein I mean to touch your love indeed,\n\nIt shall be full of poise and difficulty,\n\nAnd fearful to be granted.\n\nOTHELLO.    I will deny thee nothing,\n\nWhereon I do beseech thee grant me this, [85]\n\nTo leave me but a little to myself.\n\nDESDEMONA. Shall I deny you? no, farewell, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO. Farewell, my Desdemona, I’ll come to thee straight.\n\nDESDEMONA. Emilia, come; be it as your fancies teach you,\n\nWhate’er you be, I am obedient . [90]\n\n(Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.)\n\nOTHELLO. Excellent wretch , perdition catch my soul,\n\nBut I do love thee, and when I love thee not,\n\nChaos is come again.\n\nIAGO. My noble lord, –\n\nOTHELLO.    What dost thou say, Iago?\n\nIAGO. Did Michael Cassio, when you woo’d my lady, [95]\n\nKnow of your love?\n\nOTHELLO. He did, from first to last: ... why dost thou ask?\n\nIAGO. But for a satisfaction of my thought.\n\nNo further harm.\n\nOTHELLO.    Why of thy thought, Iago?\n\nIAGO. I did not think he had been acquainted with her. [100]\n\nOTHELLO. O yes, and went between us very often.\n\nIAGO. Indeed?\n\nOTHELLO. Indeed? Indeed: discern’st thou aught in that?\n\nIs he not honest?\n\nIAGO. Honest, my lord? [105]\n\nOTHELLO. Honest? ay, honest.\n\nIAGO. My lord, for aught I know.\n\nOTHELLO. What dost thou think?\n\nIAGO. Think, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO. Think, my lord? By heaven, he echoes me, [110]\n\nAs if there were some monster in his thought,\n\nToo hideous to be shown: thou didst mean something;\n\nI heard thee say but now, thou lik’st not that,\n\nWhen Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?\n\nAnd when I told thee he was of my counsel, [115]\n\nIn my whole course of wooing, thou criedst “Indeed?”\n\nAnd didst contract and purse thy brow together,\n\nAs if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain\n\nSome horrible conceit : if thou dost love me,\n\nShow me thy thought. [120]\n\nIAGO. My lord, you know I love you.\n\nOTHELLO.    I think thou dost,\n\nAnd for I know thou art full of love and honesty\n\nAnd weighest thy words, before thou give ’em breath,\n\nTherefore these stop s of thine fright me the more:\n\nFor such things in a false disloyal knave [125]\n\nAre tricks of custom; but in a man that’s just,\n\nThey are close denotement s , working from the heart,\n\nThat passion cannot rule.\n\nIAGO.    For Michael Cassio,\n\nI dare presume , I think that he is honest.\n\nOTHELLO. I think so too.\n\nIAGO.    Men should be that they seem, [130]\n\nOr those that be not, would they might seem none!\n\nOTHELLO. Certain, men should be what they seem.\n\nIAGO. Why then I think Cassio’s an honest man.\n\nOTHELLO. Nay, yet there’s more in this:\n\nI prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings, [135]\n\nAs thou dost ruminate , and give the worst of thought\n\nThe worst of word.\n\nIAGO.    Good my lord, pardon me;\n\nThough I am bound to every act of duty,\n\nI am not bound to that all slaves are free to;\n\n Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false: [140]\n\nAs where’s that palace, whereinto foul things\n\nSometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,\n\nBut some uncleanly apprehension s\n\nKeep leets and law-days , and in session sit\n\nWith meditation s lawful? [145]\n\nOTHELLO. Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,\n\nIf thou but thinkest him wrong’d, and makest his ear\n\nA stranger to thy thoughts.\n\nIAGO.    I do beseech you,\n\nThough I perchance am vicious in my guess,\n\n(As I confess it is my nature’s plague [150]\n\nTo spy into abuse s , and oft my jealousy\n\nShapes faults that are not) I entreat you then,\n\nFrom one that so imperfectly conject s ,\n\nYou’ld take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble\n\nOut of my scattering and unsure observance ; [155]\n\nIt were not for your quiet, nor your good,\n\nNor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,\n\nTo let you know my thoughts.\n\nOTHELLO.    Zounds!\n\nIAGO. Good name in man and woman ’s dear, my lord;\n\nIs the immediate jewel of our souls: [160]\n\nWho steals my purse, steals trash, ’tis something, nothing,\n\n’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands:\n\nBut he that filch es from me my good name\n\nRobs me of that which not enrich es him,\n\nAnd makes me poor indeed. [165]\n\nOTHELLO. By heaven I’ll know thy thought.\n\nIAGO. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,\n\nNor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody :\n\nO, beware jealousy;\n\nIt is the green-ey’d monster, which doth mock  [170]\n\nThat meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss ,\n\nWho, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger:\n\nBut O, what damned minutes tells he o’er\n\nWho dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!\n\nOTHELLO. O misery! [175]\n\nIAGO. Poor and content is rich, and rich enough,\n\nBut riches, fineless , is as poor as winter\n\nTo him that ever fears he shall be poor:\n\nGood God, the souls of all my tribe defend\n\nFrom jealousy!\n\nOTHELLO.    Why, why is this? [180]\n\nThink’st thou l’ld make a life of jealousy?\n\nTo follow still the changes of the moon\n\nWith fresh suspicions? No, to be once in doubt,\n\nIs once to be resolv’d: exchange me for a goat ,\n\nWhen I shall turn the business of my soul [185]\n\nTo such exsufflicate and blown surmise s ,\n\nMatching thy inference : ’tis not to make me jealous,\n\nTo say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,\n\nIs free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;\n\nWhere virtue is, these are more virtuous: [190]\n\nNor from mine own weak merits will I draw\n\nThe smallest fear, or doubt of her revolt,\n\nFor she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,\n\nI’ll see before I doubt, when I doubt, prove,\n\nAnd on the proof, there is no more but this: [195]\n\nAway at once with love or jealousy!\n\nIAGO. I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason\n\nTo show the love and duty that I bear you\n\nWith franker spirit: therefore as I am bound\n\nReceive it from me: I speak not yet of proof; [200]\n\nLook to your wife, observe her well with Cassio;\n\nWear your eye thus, not jealous, nor secure.\n\nI would not have your free and noble nature\n\nOut of self-bounty be abused, look to ’t:\n\nI know our country disposition well; [205]\n\nIn Venice they do let God see the pranks\n\nThey dare not show their husbands: their best conscience\n\nIs not to leave undone, but keep unknown.\n\nOTHELLO. Dost thou say so?\n\nIAGO. She did deceive her father, marrying you; [210]\n\nAnd when she seem’d to shake and fear your looks,\n\nShe lov’d them most.\n\nOTHELLO.    And so she did.\n\nIAGO.        Why, go to then,\n\nShe that so young could give out such a seeming,\n\nTo seal her father’s eyes up, close as oak,\n\nHe thought ’twas witchcraft: but I am much to blame, [215]\n\nI humbly do beseech you of your pardon,\n\nFor too much loving you.\n\nOTHELLO.    I am bound to thee for ever.\n\nIAGO. I see this hath a little dash ’d your spirits.\n\nOTHELLO. Not a jot, not a jot.\n\nIAGO.    I’ faith I fear it has.\n\nI hope you will consider what is spoke [220]\n\nComes from my love: but I do see you are mov’d,\n\nI am to pray you, not to strain my speech\n\nTo grosser issues, nor to larger reach,\n\nThan to suspicion.\n\nOTHELLO. I will not.\n\nIAGO.    Should you do so, my lord, [225]\n\nMy speech should fall into such vile success\n\nAs my thoughts aim not at: Cassio’s my trusty friend:\n\nMy lord, I see you are mov’d.\n\nOTHELLO.    No, not much mov’d,\n\nI do not think but Desdemona’s honest.\n\nIAGO. Long live she so, and long live you to think so! [230]\n\nOTHELLO. And yet how nature erring from itself –\n\nIAGO. Ay, there’s the point: as, to be bold with you,\n\nNot to affect many proposed match es ,\n\nOf her own clime , complexion , and degree,\n\nWhereto we see in all things nature tends; [235]\n\nFie, we may smell in such a will most rank ,\n\nFoul disproportion; thoughts unnatural.\n\nBut pardon me: I do not in position\n\nDistinctly speak of her, though I may fear\n\nHer will, recoil ing to her better judgement, [240]\n\nMay fall to match you with her country form s ,\n\nAnd happily  repent .\n\nOTHELLO.    Farewell, if more\n\nThou dost perceive, let me know more, set on\n\nThy wife to observe; leave me, Iago.\n\nIAGO (going). My lord, I take my leave. [245]\n\nOTHELLO. Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless\n\nSees and knows more, much more, than he unfold s .\n\nIAGO (returning). My lord, I would I might entreat your honour\n\nTo scan this thing no further, leave it to time:\n\nThough it be fit that Cassio have his place, [250]\n\nFor sure he fills it up with great ability,\n\nYet if you please to hold him off awhile,\n\nYou shall by that perceive him and his means;\n\nNote if your lady strain her entertainment\n\nWith any strong or vehement importunity , [255]\n\nMuch will be seen in that; in the mean time,\n\nLet me be thought too busy in my fears\n\n(As worthy cause I have to fear I am);\n\nAnd hold her free, I do beseech your honour.\n\nOTHELLO. Fear not my government. [260]\n\nIAGO. I once more take my leave.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nOTHELLO. This fellow’s of exceeding honesty,\n\nAnd knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,\n\nOf human dealing: if I do prove her haggard ,\n\nThough that her jesses were my dear heart-strings , [265]\n\nI’ld whistle her off, and let her down the wind,\n\nTo prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black,\n\nAnd have not those soft parts of conversation\n\nThat chamberer s have, or for I am declin’d\n\nInto the vale of years, – yet that’s not much – [270]\n\nShe’s gone, I am abus’d, and my relief\n\nMust be to loathe her: O curse of marriage,\n\nThat we can call these delicate creatures ours,\n\nAnd not their appetites! I had rather be a toad ,\n\nAnd live upon the vapour in a dungeon , [275]\n\nThan keep a corner in a thing I love,\n\nFor others’ uses: yet ’tis the plague of great ones,\n\n Prerogativ’d are they less than the base,\n\n’Tis destiny, unshunnable , like death:\n\nEven then this forked plague is fated to us, [280]\n\nWhen we do quicken : Desdemona comes,\n\nIf she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself,\n\nI’ll not believe it.\n\n(Enter Desdemona and Emilia.)\n\nDESDEMONA.    How now, my dear Othello?\n\nYour dinner, and the generous islanders\n\nBy you invited, do attend your presence. [285]\n\nOTHELLO. I am to blame.\n\nDESDEMONA. Why is your speech so faint? are you not well?\n\nOTHELLO. I have a pain upon my forehead, here.\n\nDESDEMONA. Faith, that’s with watching, ’twill away again;\n\nLet me but bind your head, within this hour [290]\n\nIt will be well again.\n\nOTHELLO.    Your napkin is too little:\n\n(She drops her handkerchief.)\n\nLet it alone, come, I’ll go in with you.\n\nDESDEMONA.  I am very sorry that you are not well.\n\n(Exeunt Othello and Desdemona.)\n\nEMILIA. I am glad I have found this napkin;\n\nThis was her first remembrance from the Moor, [295]\n\nMy wayward husband hath a hundred times\n\nWoo’d me to steal it, but she so loves the token ,\n\nFor he conjur’d her she should ever keep it,\n\nThat she reserves it evermore about her,\n\nTo kiss, and talk to; I’ll ha’ the work ta’en out, [300]\n\nAnd give’t Iago: what he’ll do with it\n\nHeaven knows, not I,\n\nI nothing know, but for his fantasy.\n\n(Enter Iago . )\n\nIAGO. How now, what do you here alone?\n\nEMILIA. Do not you chide, I have a thing for you. [305]\n\nIAGO. A thing for me? it is a common thing –\n\nEMILIA. Ha?\n\nIAGO. To have a foolish wife.\n\nEMILIA. O, is that all? What will you give me now,\n\nFor that same handkerchief?\n\nIAGO.    What handkerchief? [310]\n\nEMILIA. What handkerchief?\n\nWhy, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,\n\nThat which so often you did bid me steal.\n\nIAGO. Hast stole it from her?\n\nEMILIA. No, faith, she let it drop by negligence, [315]\n\nAnd, to the advantage, I being here took ’t up:\n\nLook, here it is.\n\nIAGO.    A good wench , give it me.\n\nEMILIA. What will you do with it, that you have been\n\nSo earnest to have me filch it?\n\nIAGO (snatching it). Why, what’s that to you? [320]\n\nEMILIA. If it be not for some purpose of import ,\n\nGive me ’t again, poor lady, she’ll run mad,\n\nWhen she shall lack it.\n\nIAGO. Be not you known on ’t, I have use for it: ...\n\nGo, leave me: [325]\n\n(Exit Emilia.)\n\nI will in Cassio’s lodging lose this napkin,\n\nAnd let him find it: trifle s light as air\n\nAre to the jealous, confirmation s strong\n\nAs proofs of holy writ ; this may do something.\n\nThe Moor already changes with my poison: [330]\n\nDangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,\n\nWhich at the first are scarce found to distaste ,\n\nBut with a little act upon the blood\n\nBurn like the mines of sulphur : I did say so:\n\n(Enter Othello.)\n\nLook where he comes, not poppy , nor mandragora , [335]\n\nNor all the drowsy syrups of the world,\n\nShall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep\n\nWhich thou owedst yesterday.\n\nOTHELLO. Ha, ha, false to me, to me?\n\nIAGO. Why, how now, general? no more of that. [340]\n\nOTHELLO. Avaunt , be gone, thou hast set me on the rack ,\n\nI swear, ’tis better to be much abus’d\n\nThan but to know’t a little.\n\nIAGO.    How now, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO. What sense had I of her stol’n hours of lust?\n\nI saw’t not, thought it not, it harm’d not me, [345]\n\nI slept the next night well, was free and merry;\n\nI found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips;\n\nHe that is robb’d, not wanting what is stol’n,\n\nLet him not know’t, and he’s not robb’d at all.\n\nIAGO. I am sorry to hear this. [350]\n\nOTHELLO. I had been happy if the general camp,\n\n Pioner s , and all, had tasted her sweet body,\n\nSo I had nothing known: O now for ever\n\nFarewell the tranquil mind, farewell content:\n\nFarewell the plumed troop, and the big wars, [355]\n\nThat makes ambition virtue: O farewell,\n\nFarewell the neighing steed , and the shrill trump ,\n\nThe spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife ;\n\nThe royal banner, and all quality,\n\nPride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war! [360]\n\nAnd, O ye mortal  engine s , whose wide throat s\n\nThe immortal Jove’s great clamour counterfeit ;\n\nFarewell, Othello’s occupation’s gone!\n\nIAGO. Is ’t possible, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO. Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore , [365]\n\nBe sure of it, give me the ocular proof,\n\nOr by the worth of man’s eternal soul,\n\nThou hadst been better have been born a dog,\n\nThan answer my wak’d wrath.\n\nIAGO.    Is ’t come to this?\n\nOTHELLO. Make me to see ’t, or at the least so prove it, [370]\n\nThat the probation bear no hinge , nor loop ,\n\nTo hang a doubt on: or woe upon thy life!\n\nIAGO. My noble lord, –\n\nOTHELLO. If thou dost slander her, and torture me,\n\nNever pray more, abandon all remorse . [375]\n\nOn horror’s head horrors accumulate :\n\nDo deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amaz’d ,\n\nFor nothing canst thou to damnation add\n\nGreater than that.\n\nIAGO.    O grace, O heaven defend me!\n\nAre you a man, have you a soul or sense? [380]\n\nGod buy you, take mine office, – O wretched fool,\n\nThat livest to make thine honesty a vice!\n\nO monstrous world, take note, take note, O world,\n\nTo be direct and honest, is not safe,\n\nI thank you for this profit, and from hence [385]\n\nI’ll love no friend, since love breeds such offence.\n\nOTHELLO. Nay, stay, thou shouldst be honest.\n\nIAGO. I should be wise, for honesty’s a fool,\n\nAnd loses that it works for.\n\nOTHELLO.    By the world,\n\nI think my wife be honest, and think she is not, [390]\n\nI think that thou art just, and think thou art not;\n\nI’ll have some proof: my name, that was as fresh\n\nAs Dian ’s visage, is now begrim’d , and black\n\nAs mine own face: if there be cord s , or knives,\n\nPoison, or fire, or suffocating streams, [395]\n\nI’ll not endure it: would I were satisfied!\n\nIAGO. I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion,\n\nI do repent me that I put it to you;\n\nYou would be satisfied.\n\nOTHELLO.    Would, nay, I will.\n\nIAGO. And may, but, how, how satisfied, my lord? [400]\n\nWould you, the supervisor , grossly gape on,\n\nBehold her topp’d?\n\nOTHELLO.    Death and damnation ... O!\n\nIAGO. It were a tedious difficulty, I think,\n\nTo bring ’em to that prospect , damn ’em then,\n\nIf ever mortal eyes did see them bolster  [405]\n\nMore than their own; what then, how then?\n\nWhat shall I say? where’s satisfaction?\n\nIt is impossible you should see this,\n\nWere they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,\n\nAs salt as wolves, in pride; and fools as gross [410]\n\nAs ignorance made drunk: but yet I say,\n\nIf imputation and strong circumstances,\n\nWhich lead directly to the door of truth,\n\nWill give you satisfaction, you may ha’t.\n\nOTHELLO. Give me a living reason, that she’s disloyal. [415]\n\nIAGO. I do not like the office,\n\nBut sith I am enter’d into this cause so far,\n\nPrick’d to ’t by foolish honesty and love,\n\nI will go on: I lay with Cassio lately,\n\nAnd being troubled with a raging tooth , [420]\n\nI could not sleep.\n\nThere are a kind of men so loose of soul,\n\nThat in their sleeps will mutter their affairs,\n\nOne of this kind is Cassio:\n\nIn sleep I heard him say “Sweet Desdemona, [425]\n\nLet us be wary , let us hide our loves;”\n\nAnd then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand ,\n\nCry out, “Sweet creature!” and then kiss me hard,\n\nAs if he pluck’d up kisses by the roots,\n\nThat grew upon my lips, then laid his leg [430]\n\nOver my thigh , and sigh’d, and kiss’d, and then\n\nCried “Cursed fate, that gave thee to the Moor!”\n\nOTHELLO. O monstrous, monstrous!\n\nIAGO.    Nay, this was but his dream.\n\nOTHELLO. But this denote d a foregone conclusion.\n\nIAGO. ’Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream, [435]\n\nAnd this may help to thicken other proofs,\n\nThat do demonstrate thinly.\n\nOTHELLO. I’ll tear her all to pieces.\n\nIAGO. Nay, but be wise, yet we see nothing done,\n\nShe may be honest yet; tell me but this, [440]\n\nHave you not sometimes seen a handkerchief,\n\nSpotted with strawberries , in your wife’s hand?\n\nOTHELLO. I gave her such a one, ’twas my first gift.\n\nIAGO. I know not that, but such a handkerchief –\n\nI am sure it was your wife’s – did I to-day [445]\n\nSee Cassio wipe his beard with.\n\nOTHELLO.    If’t be that, –\n\nIAGO. If it be that, or any that was hers,\n\nIt speaks against her, with the other proofs.\n\nOTHELLO. O that the slave had forty thousand lives!\n\nOne is too poor, too weak for my revenge: [450]\n\nNow do I see ’tis true; look here, Iago,\n\nAll my fond love thus do I blow to heaven, ...\n\n’Tis gone.\n\nArise, black vengeance , from thy hollow cell,\n\n Yield up , O love, thy crown, and hearted throne, [455]\n\nTo tyrannous hate, swell, bosom, with thy fraught ,\n\nFor ’tis of aspic s’ tongues!\n\n(He kneels.)\n\nIAGO. Pray be content.\n\nOTHELLO.    O, blood, Iago, blood!\n\nIAGO. Patience I say, your mind perhaps may change.\n\nOTHELLO. Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic sea , [460]\n\nWhose icy current, and compulsive course,\n\nNe’er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on\n\nTo the Propontic , and the Hellespont :\n\nEven so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace\n\nShall ne’er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love, [465]\n\nTill that a capable and wide revenge\n\nSwallow them up. Now by yond  marble heaven,\n\nIn the due reverence of a sacred vow,\n\nI here engage my words.\n\nIAGO.    Do not rise yet.\n\n(Iago kneels.)\n\nWitness, you ever-burning lights above, [470]\n\nYou elements that clip us round about,\n\nWitness that here Iago doth give up\n\nThe excellency of his wit, hand, heart,\n\nTo wrong’d Othello’s service: let him command,\n\nAnd to obey shall be in me remorse, [475]\n\nWhat bloody work so ever.\n\n(They rise.)\n\nOTHELLO.    I greet thy love;\n\nNot with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,\n\nAnd will upon the instant put thee to ’t,\n\nWithin these three days, let me hear thee say\n\nThat Cassio’s not alive.\n\nIAGO.    My friend is dead: [480]\n\n’Tis done as you request, but let her live.\n\nOTHELLO. Damn her, lewd  minx : O, damn her!\n\nCome, go with me apart, I will withdraw\n\nTo furnish me with some swift means of death,\n\nFor the fair devil: now art thou my lieutenant. [485]\n\nIAGO. I am your own for ever.\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nScene 4\n\nThe same.\n\nEnter Desdemona, Emilia, and the Clown.\n\nDESDEMONA. Do you know, sirrah , where the Lieutenant Cassio lies?\n\nCLOWN. I dare not say he lies any where.\n\nDESDEMONA. Why, man?\n\nCLOWN. He is a soldier, and for one to say a soldier [5]  lies , is stab bing .\n\nDESDEMONA. Go to, where lodge s he?\n\nCLOWN. To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.\n\nDESDEMONA. Can any thing be made of this? [10]\n\nCLOWN. I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging, and say he lies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.\n\nDESDEMONA. Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report? [15]\n\nCLOWN. I will catechize the world for him, that is, make questions and by them answer.\n\nDESDEMONA. Seek him, bid him come hither, tell him I have moved my lord in his behalf, and hope all will be well. [20]\n\nCLOWN. To do this is within the compass of a man, and therefore I’ll attempt the doing of it.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nDESDEMONA. Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?\n\nEMILIA. I know not, madam.\n\nDESDEMONA. Believe me, I had rather lose my purse [25]\n\nFull of crusado es : and but my noble Moor\n\nIs true of mind, and made of no such baseness\n\nAs jealous creatures are, it were enough\n\nTo put him to ill thinking.\n\nEMILIA.    Is he not jealous?\n\nDESDEMONA. Who, he? I think the sun where he was born [30]\n\nDrew all such humours from him.\n\n(Enter Othello.)\n\nEMILIA.    Look, where he comes.\n\nDESDEMONA. I will not leave him now; let Cassio\n\nBe call’d to him. How is it with you, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO. Well, my good lady: (Aside.) O, hardness to dissemble !\n\nHow do you do, Desdemona?\n\nDESDEMONA.    Well, my good lord. [35]\n\nOTHELLO. Give me your hand; this hand is moist , my lady.\n\nDESDEMONA. It yet has felt no age, nor known no sorrow.\n\nOTHELLO. This argues fruitfulness, and liberal heart;\n\nHot, hot, and moist, this hand of yours requires\n\nA sequester from liberty; fasting and praying, [40]\n\nMuch castigation , exercise devout ;\n\nFor here’s a young and sweating devil here,\n\nThat commonly rebels: ’tis a good hand,\n\nA frank one.\n\nDESDEMONA. You may indeed say so,\n\nFor ’twas that hand that gave away my heart. [45]\n\nOTHELLO. A liberal hand; the hearts of old gave hands,\n\nBut our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.\n\nDESDEMONA. I cannot speak of this; come, come, your promise.\n\nOTHELLO. What promise, chuck ?\n\nDESDEMONA. I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you. [50]\n\nOTHELLO. I have a salt and sullen  rheum offends me,\n\nLend me thy handkerchief.\n\nDESDEMONA. Here, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO. That which I gave you.\n\nDESDEMONA. I have it not about me. [55]\n\nOTHELLO. Not?\n\nDESDEMONA. No, faith, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO.    That’s a fault: that handkerchief\n\nDid an Egyptian to my mother give,\n\nShe was a charmer , and could almost read\n\nThe thoughts of people; she told her, while she kept it [60]\n\n’Twould make her amiable , and subdue my father\n\nEntirely to her love: but if she lost it,\n\nOr made a gift of it, my father’s eye\n\nShould hold her loathly , and his spirits should hunt\n\nAfter new fancies: she dying, gave it me, [65]\n\nAnd bid me, when my fate would have me wive,\n\nTo give it her; I did so, and take heed on ’t,\n\nMake it a darling, like your precious eye,\n\nTo lose, or give ’t away, were such perdition\n\nAs nothing else could match.\n\nDESDEMONA.    Is ’t possible? [70]\n\nOTHELLO. ’Tis true, there’s magic in the web of it;\n\nA sibyl , that had number’d in the world\n\nThe sun to make two hundred compasses,\n\nIn her prophetic fury sew’d the work;\n\nThe worms were hallow’d that did breed the silk , [75]\n\nAnd it was dye d in mummy , which the skilful\n\nConserve of maidens’ hearts.\n\nDESDEMONA.    I’ faith, is ’t true?\n\nOTHELLO. Most veritable , therefore look to ’t well.\n\nDESDEMONA. Then would to God that I had never seen it!\n\nOTHELLO. Ha, wherefore? [80]\n\nDESDEMONA. Why do you speak so startingly  an d rash?\n\nOTHELLO. Is ’t lost? is ’t gone? speak, is it out o’ the way?\n\nDESDEMONA. Heaven bless us!\n\nOTHELLO. Say you?\n\nDESDEMONA. It is not lost, but what an if it were? [85]\n\nOTHELLO. Ha!\n\nDESDEMONA. I say it is not lost.\n\nOTHELLO.    Fetch ’t, let me see it.\n\nDESDEMONA. Why, so I can sir, but I will not now,\n\nThis is a trick, to put me from my suit,\n\nI pray let Cassio be receiv’d again. [90]\n\nOTHELLO. Fetch me that handkerchief, my mind misgive s .\n\nDESDEMONA. Come, come,\n\nYou’ll never meet a more sufficient man.\n\nOTHELLO. The handkerchief!\n\nDESDEMONA.    I pray, talk me of Cassio.\n\nOTHELLO. The handkerchief!\n\nDESDEMONA.    A man that all his time [95]\n\nHath founded his good fortunes on your love,\n\nShar’d dangers with you, –\n\nOTHELLO. The handkerchief!\n\nDESDEMONA.    I’ faith, you are to blame.\n\nOTHELLO. Zounds!\n\n(Exit.)\n\nEMILIA. Is not this man jealous? [100]\n\nDESDEMONA. I ne’er saw this before:\n\nSure there’s some wonder in this handkerchief,\n\nI am most unhappy in the loss of it.\n\nEMILIA. ’Tis not a year or two shows us a man:\n\nThey are all but stomachs, and we all but food; [105]\n\nThey eat us hungerly, and when they are full,\n\nThey belch us.\n\n(Enter Iago and Cassio.)\n\nLook you, Cassio and my husband.\n\nIAGO. There is no other way, ’tis she must do it,\n\nAnd lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.\n\nDESDEMONA. How now, good Cassio, what’s the news with you? [110]\n\nCASSIO. Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you,\n\nThat by your virtuous means I may again\n\nExist, and be a member of his love,\n\nWhom I, with all the duty of my heart,\n\nEntirely honour; I would not be delay’d: [115]\n\nIf my offence be of such mortal kind,\n\nThat neither service past, nor present sorrows,\n\nNor purpos’d merit in futurity ,\n\nCan ransom me into his love again,\n\nBut to know so must be my benefit; [120]\n\nSo shall I clothe me in a forc’d content,\n\nAnd shut myself up in some other course\n\nTo fortune’s alms .\n\nDESDEMONA.    Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio,\n\nMy advocation is not now in tune ;\n\nMy lord is not my lord, nor should I know him, [125]\n\nWere he in favour as in humour alter’d.\n\nSo help me every spirit sanctified ,\n\nAs I have spoken for you, all my best,\n\nAnd stood within the blank of his displeasure\n\nFor my free speech: you must awhile be patient; [130]\n\nWhat I can do I will, and more I will\n\nThan for myself I dare, let that suffice you.\n\nIAGO. Is my lord angry?\n\nEMILIA.    He went hence but now,\n\nAnd certainly in strange unquietness.\n\nIAGO. Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon , [135]\n\nWhen it hath blown his rank s into the air;\n\nAnd (like the devil) from his very arm\n\n Puff ’d his own brother, and can he be angry?\n\nSomething of moment then: I will go meet him,\n\nThere’s matter in ’t indeed, if he be angry. [140]\n\n(Exit.)\n\nDESDEMONA. I prithee do so: something sure of state,\n\nEither from Venice, or some unhatch’d  practice ,\n\nMade demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,\n\nHath puddle d his clear spirit, and in such cases\n\nMen’s natures wrangle with inferior things, [145]\n\nThough great ones are the object.\n\n’Tis even so; for let our finger ache ,\n\nAnd it indues our other healthful members\n\nEven to that sense of pain; nay, we must think\n\nMen are not gods; [150]\n\nNor of them look for such observance s\n\nAs fits the bridal : beshrew me much, Emilia,\n\nI was ( unhandsome warrior as I am)\n\n Arraign ing his unkindness with my soul;\n\nBut now I find I had suborn ’d the witness, [155]\n\nAnd he’s indicted falsely.\n\nEMILIA. Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,\n\nAnd no conception , nor no jealous toy\n\nConcerning you.\n\nDESDEMONA. Alas the day, I never gave him cause! [160]\n\nEMILIA. But jealous souls will not be answer’d so;\n\nThey are not ever jealous for the cause,\n\nBut jealous for they are jealous: ’tis a monster,\n\n Begot upon itself, born on itself.\n\nDESDEMONA. Heaven keep that monster from Othello’s mind! [165]\n\nEMILIA. Lady, amen.\n\nDESDEMONA. I will go seek him, Cassio, walk hereabout,\n\nIf I do find him fit, I’ll move your suit,\n\nAnd seek to effect it to my uttermost.\n\nCASSIO. I humbly thank your ladyship. [170]\n\n(Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.)\n\n(Enter Bianca.)\n\nBIANCA. Save you, friend Cassio!\n\nCASSIO.    What make you from home?\n\nHow is it with you, my most fair Bianca?\n\nI’ faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.\n\nBIANCA. And I was going to your lodging, Cassio;\n\nWhat, keep a week away? seven days and nights? [175]\n\nEight score eight hours, and lovers’ absent hours,\n\nMore tedious than the dial , eight score times?\n\nO weary reckoning !\n\nCASSIO.    Pardon me, Bianca,\n\nI have this while with leaden thoughts been press’d,\n\nBut I shall in a more convenient time [180]\n\nStrike off this score of absence: sweet Bianca,\n\n(Giving her Desdemona’s handkerchief.)\n\nTake me this work out.\n\nBIANCA.    O Cassio, whence came this?\n\nThis is some token from a newer friend;\n\nTo the felt absence, now I feel a cause,\n\nIs ’t come to this?\n\nCASSIO.    Go to, woman, [185]\n\nThrow your vile guesses in the devil’s teeth,\n\nFrom whence you have them; you are jealous now\n\nThat this is from some mistress, some remembrance.\n\nNo, by my faith, Bianca.\n\nBIANCA.    Why, whose is it?\n\nCASSIO. I know not, sweet, I found it in my chamber; [190]\n\nI like the work well; ere it be demanded,\n\nAs like enough it will, I’ld have it copied;\n\nTake it, and do ’t, and leave me for this time.\n\nBIANCA. Leave you, wherefore?\n\nCASSIO. I do attend here on the general, [195]\n\nAnd think it no addition , nor my wish,\n\nTo have him see me woman’d.\n\nBIANCA.    Why, I pray you?\n\nCASSIO. Not that I love you not.\n\nBIANCA.    But that you do not love me:\n\nI pray you bring me on the way a little,\n\nAnd say, if I shall see you soon at night. [200]\n\nCASSIO. ’Tis but a little way that I can bring you,\n\nFor I attend here, but I’ll see you soon.\n\nBIANCA. ’Tis very good, I must be circumstanc’d .\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nAct IV\n\nScene 1\n\nThe same.\n\nEnter Iago and Othello.\n\nIAGO. Will you think so?\n\nOTHELLO.    Think so, Iago?\n\nIAGO.    What,\n\nTo kiss in private?\n\nOTHELLO.    An unauthoriz’d kiss.\n\nIAGO. Or to be naked with her friend abed ,\n\nAn hour, or more, not meaning any harm?\n\nOTHELLO. Naked abed, Iago, and not mean harm? [5]\n\nIt is hypocrisy against the devil:\n\nThey that mean virtuously, and yet do so,\n\nThe devil their virtue tempt s , and they tempt heaven.\n\nIAGO. So they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip ;\n\nBut if I give my wife a handkerchief – [10]\n\nOTHELLO. What then?\n\nIAGO. Why then ’tis hers, my lord, and being hers,\n\nShe may, I think, bestow ’t on any man.\n\nOTHELLO. She is protectress of her honour too,\n\nMay she give that? [15]\n\nIAGO. Her honour is an essence that’s not seen,\n\nThey have it very oft that have it not:\n\nBut for the handkerchief –\n\nOTHELLO. By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it:\n\nThou said’st (O, it comes o’er my memory, [20]\n\nAs doth the raven o’er the infected house,\n\n Boding to all) he had my handkerchief.\n\nIAGO. Ay, what of that?\n\nOTHELLO.    That’s not so good now.\n\nIAGO. What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong?\n\nOr heard him say – as knaves be such abroad, [25]\n\nWho having, by their own importunate suit,\n\nOr voluntary dotage of some mistress,\n\nConvinced or supplied them, cannot choose\n\nBut they must blab –\n\nOTHELLO.    Hath he said anything?\n\nIAGO. He hath, my lord, but be you well assur’d, [30]\n\nNo more than he’ll unswear .\n\nOTHELLO.    What hath he said?\n\nIAGO. Faith, that he did ... I know not what he did.\n\nOTHELLO. But what?\n\nIAGO. Lie.\n\nOTHELLO.    With her?\n\nIAGO.        With her, on her, what you will.\n\nOTHELLO. Lie with her, lie on her? – We say lie on her, [35] when they belie her, – lie with her, zounds, that’s fulsome ! Handkerchief – confessions – handkerchief! To confess, and be hanged for his labour. First, to be hanged, and then to confess; I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such [40]  shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shake me thus. Pish ! Noses, ears and lips. Is ’t possible? – Confess? – Handkerchief? – O devil!\n\n(He falls down.)\n\nIAGO. Work on, [45]\n\nMy medicine, work: thus credulous fools are caught,\n\nAnd many worthy and chaste dames, even thus\n\nAll guiltless, meet reproach. What ho, my lord,\n\nMy lord, I say! Othello! ...\n\n(Enter Cassio.)\n\nHow now, Cassio?\n\nCASSIO. What’s the matter? [50]\n\nIAGO. My lord is fall’n into an epilepsy,\n\nThis is his second fit , he had one yesterday.\n\nCASSIO. Rub him about the temple s .\n\nIAGO.    No, forbear ,\n\nThe lethargy must have his quiet course,\n\nIf not, he foam s at mouth, and by and by [55]\n\nBreaks out to savage madness: look, he stirs:\n\nDo you withdraw yourself a little while,\n\nHe will recover straight; when he is gone,\n\nI would on great occasion speak with you.\n\n(Exit Cassio.)\n\nHow is it, general? have you not hurt your head? [60]\n\nOTHELLO. Dost thou mock me?\n\nIAGO.    I mock you? no, by heaven.\n\nWould you would bear your fortunes like a man!\n\nOTHELLO. A horned man ’s a monster, and a beast.\n\nIAGO. There’s many a beast then in a populous city,\n\nAnd many a civil monster. [65]\n\nOTHELLO. Did he confess?\n\nIAGO.    Good sir, be a man,\n\nThink every bearded fellow that ’s but yok’d\n\nMay draw with you; there’s millions now alive\n\nThat nightly lies in those unproper beds\n\nWhich they dare swear peculiar: your case is better: [70]\n\nO, ’tis the spite of hell, the fiend ’s arch-mock,\n\nTo lip a wanton in a secure couch,\n\nAnd to suppose her chaste. No, let me know,\n\nAnd knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.\n\nOTHELLO. O, thou art wise, ’tis certain.\n\nIAGO.    Stand you awhile apart, [75]\n\n Confine yourself but in a patient list :\n\nWhilst you were here erewhile , mad with your grief –\n\nA passion most unsuiting such a man –\n\nCassio came hither; I shifted him away,\n\nAnd laid good ’scuse upon your ecstasy, [80]\n\nBid him anon return, and here speak with me,\n\nThe which he promis’d: but encave yourself,\n\nAnd mark the jeer s , the gibe s , and notable  scorn s ,\n\nThat dwell in every region of his face;\n\nFor I will make him tell the tale anew, [85]\n\nWhere, how, how oft, how long ago, and when,\n\nHe has, and is again to cope your wife:\n\nI say, but mark his gesture; marry, patience,\n\nOr I shall say you are all in all in spleen ,\n\nAnd nothing of a man.\n\nOTHELLO.    Dost thou hear, Iago? [90]\n\nI will be found most cunning in my patience;\n\nBut – dost thou hear? – most bloody.\n\nIAGO.    That’s not amiss:\n\nBut yet keep time in all; will you withdraw?\n\n(Othello withdraws.)\n\nNow will I question Cassio of Bianca;\n\nA housewife that by selling her desires [95]\n\nBuys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature\n\nThat dotes on Cassio: as ’tis the strumpet ’s plague\n\nTo beguile many, and be beguil’d by one.\n\n(Enter Cassio.)\n\nHe, when he hears of her, cannot refrain\n\nFrom the excess of laughter: here he comes: [100]\n\nAs he shall smile, Othello shall go mad,\n\nAnd his unbookish jealousy must conster\n\nPoor Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and light behaviour,\n\nQuite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?\n\nCASSIO. The worser, that you give me the addition , [105]\n\nWhose want even kills me.\n\nIAGO. Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on ’t.\n\nNow if this suit lay in Bianca’s power,\n\nHow quickly should you speed!\n\nCASSIO.    Alas, poor caitiff !\n\nOTHELLO. Look how he laughs already! [110]\n\nIAGO. I never knew a woman love man so.\n\nCASSIO. Alas, poor rogue , I think i’ faith she loves me.\n\nOTHELLO. Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.\n\nIAGO. Do you hear, Cassio?\n\nOTHELLO.    Now he importunes him\n\nTo tell it on; go to, well said, well said. [115]\n\nIAGO. She gives it out that you shall marry her,\n\nDo you intend it?\n\nCASSIO. Ha, ha, ha!\n\nOTHELLO. Do you triumph, Roman, do you triumph?\n\nCASSIO. I marry her? what? a customer ; [120]\n\nI prithee, bear some charity to my wit,\n\nDo not think it so unwholesome . Ha, ha, ha!\n\nOTHELLO. So, so, so, so; laugh that wins.\n\nIAGO. Faith, the cry goes, you shall marry her.\n\nCASSIO. Prithee say true. [125]\n\nIAGO. I am a very villain else.\n\nOTHELLO. Ha’ you scor’d me? Well.\n\nCASSIO. This is the monkey’s own giving out; she is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery , not out of my promise. [130]\n\nOTHELLO. Iago beckon s me, now he begins the story.\n\nCASSIO. She was here even now, she haunt s me in every place. I was t’ other day talking on the sea-bank, with certain Venetians, and thither comes this bauble ; by this hand, she falls thus about my neck: – [135]\n\nOTHELLO. Crying “O dear Cassio!” as it were: his gesture imports it.\n\nCASSIO. So hangs, and loll s , and weeps upon me; so hales , and pulls me, ha, ha, ha!\n\nOTHELLO. Now he tells how she pluck’d him to my [140] chamber. I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw ’t to.\n\nCASSIO. Well, I must leave her company.\n\n(Enter Bianca.)\n\nIAGO. Before me ! look where she comes.\n\nCASSIO. ’Tis such another fitchew ; marry, a perfum’d one. [145]\n\nWhat do you mean by this haunting of me?\n\nBIANCA. Let the devil and his dam  haunt you, what did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it; I must take out the whole work, a likely piece of work, that you [150] should find it in your chamber, and not know who left it there! This is some minx’s token, and I must take out the work; there, give it the hobby-horse , wheresoever you had it, I’ll take out no work on ’t.\n\nCASSIO. How now, my sweet Bi an ca, how now, how [155] now?\n\nOTHELLO. By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!\n\nBIANCA. An you’ll come to sup per to-night, you may, an you will not, come when you are next prepar’d [160] for.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nIAGO. After her, after her.\n\nCASSIO. Faith, I must, she’ll rail i’ the street else.\n\nIAGO. Will you sup there?\n\nCASSIO. Faith, I intend so. [165]\n\nIAGO. Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak with you.\n\nCASSIO. Prithee come, will you?\n\nIAGO. Go to, say no more.\n\n(Exit Cassio.)\n\nOTHELLO (advancing). How shall I murder him, Iago? [170]\n\nIAGO. Did you perceive, how he laughed at his vice?\n\nOTHELLO. O Iago!\n\nIAGO. And did you see the handkerchief?\n\nOTHELLO. Was that mine?\n\nIAGO. Yours, by this hand: and to see how he prize s  [175] the foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.\n\nOTHELLO. I would have him nine years a-killing; a fine woman, a fair woman, a sweet woman!\n\nIAGO. Nay, you must forget. [180]\n\nOTHELLO. And let her rot , and perish , and be damned to-night, for she shall not live; no, my heart is turn’d to stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand: O, the world has not a sweeter creature, she might lie by an emperor ’s side, and command him tasks. [185]\n\nIAGO. Nay, that’s not your way.\n\nOTHELLO. Hang her, I do but say what she is: so delicate with her needle, an admirable musician, O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear; of so high and plenteous wit and invention ! [190]\n\nIAGO. She’s the worse for all this.\n\nOTHELLO. A thousand thousand times: and then of so gentle a condition!\n\nIAGO. Ay, too gentle.\n\nOTHELLO. Ay, that’s certain, but yet the pity of it, [195] Iago: O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!\n\nIAGO. If you be so fond over her iniquity , give her patent to offend, for if it touches not you, it comes near nobody.\n\nOTHELLO. I will chop her into messes ... Cuckold me! [200]\n\nIAGO. O, ’tis foul in her.\n\nOTHELLO. With mine officer!\n\nIAGO. That’s fouler.\n\nOTHELLO. Get me some poison, Iago, this night; I’ll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty [205]  unprovide my mind again, this night, Iago.\n\nIAGO. Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminate d .\n\nOTHELLO. Good, good, the justice of it pleases, very good. [210]\n\nIAGO. And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker : you shall hear more by midnight.\n\nOTHELLO. Excellent good. (A trumpet within.) What trumpet is that same?\n\n(Enter Lodovico, Desdemona, and Attendants.)\n\nIAGO. Something from Venice, sure; ’tis Lodovico, [215]\n\nCome from the duke, and see, your wife is with him.\n\nLODOVICO. God save the worthy general!\n\nOTHELLO.    With all my heart, sir.\n\nLODOVICO. The duke and senators of Venice greet you.\n\n(Gives him a letter.)\n\nOTHELLO. I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.\n\n(Opens the letter, and reads.)\n\nDESDEMONA. And what’s the news, good cousin Lodovico? [220]\n\nIAGO. I am very glad to see you, signior: ...\n\nWelcome to Cyprus.\n\nLODOVICO. I thank you; how does Lieutenant Cassio?\n\nIAGO. Lives, sir.\n\nDESDEMONA. Cousin, there’s fall’n between him and my lord [225]\n\nAn unkind breach , but you shall make all well.\n\nOTHELLO. Are you sure of that?\n\nDESDEMONA. My lord?\n\nOTHELLO (reads). “This fail you not to do, as you will ...”\n\nLODOVICO. He did not call, he’s busy in the paper: [230]\n\nIs there division between thy lord and Cassio?\n\nDESDEMONA. A most unhappy one; I would do much\n\nTo atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.\n\nOTHELLO. Fire and brimstone !\n\nDESDEMONA.    My lord?\n\nOTHELLO.        Are you wise?\n\nDESDEMONA. What, is he angry?\n\nLODOVICO.    May be the letter mov’d him; [235]\n\nFor, as I think, they do command him home,\n\n Deputing Cassio in his government.\n\nDESDEMONA. By my troth , I am glad on ’t.\n\nOTHELLO.    Indeed!\n\nDESDEMONA.        My lord?\n\nOTHELLO. I am glad to see you mad.\n\nDESDEMONA.    How, sweet Othello?\n\nOTHELLO. Devil! [240]\n\n(Striking her.)\n\nDESDEMONA. I have not deserv’d this.\n\nLODOVICO. My lord, this would not be believ’d in Venice,\n\nThough I should swear I saw ’t: ’tis very much,\n\n Make her amends , she weeps.\n\nOTHELLO.    O devil, devil!\n\nIf that the earth could teem with women’s tears, [245]\n\nEach drop she falls would prove a crocodile:\n\nOut of my sight!\n\nDESDEMONA.    I will not stay to offend you.\n\n(Going.)\n\nLODOVICO. Truly, an obedient lady:\n\nI do beseech your lordship, call her back.\n\nOTHELLO. Mistress! [250]\n\nDESDEMONA. My lord?\n\nOTHELLO. What would you with her, sir?\n\nLODOVICO.    Who, I, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO. Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn:\n\nSir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,\n\nAnd turn again, and she can weep, sir, weep; [255]\n\nAnd she’s obedient, as you say, obedient;\n\nVery obedient. Proceed you in your tears.\n\nConcerning this, sir, – O well-painted passion! –\n\nI am commanded here: ... get you away,\n\nI’ll send for you anon ... Sir, I obey the mandate, [260]\n\nAnd will return to Venice: ... Hence, avaunt !\n\n(Exit Desdemona.)\n\nCassio shall have my place; and, sir, to-night,\n\nI do entreat that we may sup together,\n\nYou are welcome, sir, to Cyprus ... Goats and monkeys!\n\n(Exit.)\n\nLODOVICO. Is this the noble Moor, whom our full senate [265]\n\nCall all in all sufficient ? This the noble nature,\n\nWhom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue\n\nThe shot of accident, nor dart of chance,\n\nCould neither graze , nor pierce?\n\nIAGO.    He is much chang’d.\n\nLODOVICO. Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain? [270]\n\nIAGO. He’s that he is; I may not breathe my censure ,\n\nWhat he might be; if, as he might, he is not,\n\nI would to heaven he were!\n\nLODOVICO.    What, strike his wife?\n\nIAGO. Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew\n\nThat stroke would prove the worst!\n\nLODOVICO.    Is it his use? [275]\n\nOr did the letters work upon his blood,\n\nAnd new create this fault?\n\nIAGO.    Alas, alas!\n\nIt is not honesty in me to speak\n\nWhat I have seen and known; you shall observe him,\n\nAnd his own courses will denote him so, [280]\n\nThat I may save my speech: do but go after,\n\nAnd mark how he continues.\n\nLODOVICO. I am sorry that I am deceiv’d in him.\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nScene 2\n\nA Room in the Castle.\n\nEnter Othello and Emilia.\n\nOTHELLO. You have seen nothing, then?\n\nEMILIA. Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.\n\nOTHELLO. Yes, and you have seen Cassio and she together.\n\nEMILIA. But then I saw no harm, and then I heard\n\nEach syllable that breath made up between ’em. [5]\n\nOTHELLO. What, did they never whisper?\n\nEMILIA.    Never, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO. Nor send you out o’ the way?\n\nEMILIA. Never.\n\nOTHELLO. To fetch her fan , her mask, her gloves, nor nothing?\n\nEMILIA. Never, my lord. [10]\n\nOTHELLO. That’s strange.\n\nEMILIA. I durst , my lord, to wager she is honest,\n\nLay down my soul at stake : if you think other,\n\nRemove your thought, it doth abuse your bosom;\n\nIf any wretch ha’ put this in your head, [15]\n\nLet heaven requite it with the serpent ’s curse,\n\nFor if she be not honest, chaste, and true,\n\nThere’s no man happy, the purest of her sex\n\nIs foul as slander.\n\nOTHELLO.    Bid her come hither, go.\n\n(Exit Emilia.)\n\nShe says enough, yet she’s a simple bawd  [20]\n\nThat cannot say as much: this is a subtle whore,\n\nA closet , lock and key, of villainous secrets,\n\nAnd yet she’ll kneel and pray, I ha’ seen her do ’t.\n\n(Enter Desdemona and Emilia.)\n\nDESDEMONA. My lord, what is your will?\n\nOTHELLO.    Pray, chuck, come hither.\n\nDESDEMONA. What is your pleasure?\n\nOTHELLO.    Let me see your eyes, ... [25]\n\nLook in my face.\n\nDESDEMONA.   What horrible fancy ’s this?\n\nOTHELLO (to Emilia). Some of your function , mistress,\n\nLeave procreant s alone, and shut the door,\n\nCough, or cry hem , if anybody come;\n\nYour mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch . [30]\n\n(Exit Emilia.)\n\nDESDEMONA.\n\nUpon my knees, what does your speech import?\n\nI understand a fury in your words,\n\nBut not the words.\n\nOTHELLO. Why, what art thou?\n\nDESDEMONA. Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife. [35]\n\nOTHELLO. Come, swear it, damn thyself,\n\nLest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves\n\nShould fear to seize thee, therefore be double-damn’d,\n\nSwear thou art honest.\n\nDESDEMONA.    Heaven doth truly know it.\n\nOTHELLO. Heaven truly knows, that thou art false as hell. [40]\n\nDESDEMONA. To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?\n\nOTHELLO. O Desdemona, away! away! away!\n\nDESDEMONA. Alas the heavy day, why do you weep?\n\nAm I the occasion of those tears, my lord?\n\nIf haply you my father do suspect [45]\n\nAn instrument of this your calling back,\n\nLay not your blame on me; if you have lost him,\n\nWhy, I have lost him too.\n\nOTHELLO.    Had it pleas’d heaven\n\nTo try me with affliction , had he rain’d\n\nAll kinds of sore s and shames on my bare head, [50]\n\n Steep ’d me in poverty , to the very lips,\n\nGiven to captivity me and my hopes,\n\nI should have found in some part of my soul\n\nA drop of patience; but, alas, to make me\n\nA fixed figure, for the time of scorn  [55]\n\nTo point his slow unmoving fingers at ... oh, oh.\n\nYet could I bear that too, well, very well:\n\nBut there, where I have garner’d up my heart,\n\nWhere either I must live, or bear no life,\n\nThe fountain , from the which my current runs, [60]\n\nOr else dries up, to be discard ed thence,\n\nOr keep it as a cistern, for foul toads\n\nTo knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there;\n\nPatience, thou young and rose-lipp’d cherubin,\n\nI here look grim as hell! [65]\n\nDESDEMONA. I hope my noble lord esteem s me honest.\n\nOTHELLO. O, ay, as summer’s flies, are in the shambles ,\n\nThat quicken even with blowing :\n\nO thou black weed , why art so lovely fair?\n\nThou smell’st so sweet, that the sense aches at thee, [70]\n\nWould thou hadst ne’er been born!\n\nDESDEMONA. Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed ?\n\nOTHELLO. Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,\n\nMade to write “whore” on? ... What, committed?\n\nCommitted! O thou public commoner ! [75]\n\nI should make very forge s of my cheeks,\n\nThat would to cinders burn up modesty,\n\nDid I but speak thy deeds. What committed!\n\nHeaven stops the nose at it, and the moon wink s ,\n\nThe bawdy wind, that kisses all it meets, [80]\n\nIs hush ’d within the hollow mine of earth,\n\nAnd will not hear ’t: ... what committed, –\n\n Impudent strumpet!\n\nDESDEMONA.    By heaven, you do me wrong.\n\nOTHELLO. Are not you a strumpet?\n\nDESDEMONA.    No, as I am a Christian:\n\nIf to preserve this vessel for my lord [85]\n\nFrom any hated foul unlawful touch,\n\nBe not to be a strumpet, I am none.\n\nOTHELLO. What, not a whore?\n\nDESDEMONA.    No, as I shall be sav’d.\n\n(Enter Emilia.)\n\nOTHELLO. Is ’t possible?\n\nDESDEMONA. O heaven, forgiveness.\n\nOTHELLO.    I cry you mercy, [90]\n\nI took you for that cunning whore of Venice,\n\nThat married with Othello: you, mistress,\n\nThat have the office opposite to Saint Peter,\n\nAnd keeps the gates in hell, ay, you, you, you!\n\nWe ha’ done our course; there’s money for your pains, [95]\n\nI pray you turn the key, and keep our counsel.\n\n(Exit.)\n\nEMILIA. Alas, what does this gentleman conceive ?\n\nHow do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?\n\nDESDEMONA. Faith, half asleep.\n\nEMILIA. Good madam, what’s the matter with my lord? [100]\n\nDESDEMONA. With who?\n\nEMILIA. Why, with my lord, madam.\n\nDESDEMONA. Who is thy lord?\n\nEMILIA.    He that is yours, sweet lady.\n\nDESDEMONA. I ha’ none, do not talk to me, Emilia,\n\nI cannot weep, nor answer have I none, [105]\n\nBut what should go by water: prithee, to-night\n\nLay on my bed our wedding sheets ; remember,\n\nAnd call thy husband hither.\n\nEMILIA.    Here is a change indeed!\n\n(Exit.)\n\nDESDEMONA. ’Tis meet I should be us’d so, very well;\n\nHow have I been behav’d, that he might stick [110]\n\nThe smallest opinion, on my greatest abuse?\n\n(Enter Iago and Emilia.)\n\nIAGO. What is your pleasure, madam? How is’t with you?\n\nDESDEMONA.\n\nI cannot tell: those that do teach young babe s\n\nDo it with gentle means, and easy tasks;\n\nHe might ha’ chid me so, for, in good faith, [115]\n\nI am a child at chiding.\n\nIAGO.    What is the matter, lady?\n\nEMILIA. Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhor’d her,\n\nThrown such despite , and heavy term s upon her,\n\nAs true hearts cannot bear.\n\nDESDEMONA. Am I that name, Iago?\n\nIAGO.    What name, fair lady? [120]\n\nDESDEMONA. Such as she says my lord did say I was?\n\nEMILIA. He call’d her whore: a beggar in his drink\n\nCould not have laid such terms upon his callat .\n\nIAGO. Why did he so?\n\nDESDEMONA. I do not know, I am sure I am none such. [125]\n\nIAGO. Do not weep, do not weep: alas the day!\n\nEMILIA. Has she forsook so many noble matches,\n\nHer father, and her country, all her friends,\n\nTo be call’d whore? would it not make one weep?\n\nDESDEMONA. It is my wretched fortune.\n\nIAGO. Beshrew him for it! [130]\n\nHow comes this trick upon him?\n\nDESDEMONA.    Nay, heaven doth know.\n\nEMILIA. I will be hang’d, if some eternal villain,\n\nSome busy and insinuating rogue,\n\nSome cogging , cozening slave, to get some office,\n\nHave not devis’d this slander, I’ll be hang’d else. [135]\n\nIAGO. Fie, there is no such man, it is impossible.\n\nDESDEMONA. If any such there be, heaven pardon him!\n\nEMILIA. A halter pardon him, and hell gnaw his bones!\n\nWhy should he call her whore? who keeps her company?\n\nWhat place, what time, what form, what likelihood ? [140]\n\nThe Moor’s abus’d by some outrageous knave,\n\nSome base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow;\n\nO heaven, that such companions thou ’ldst unfold,\n\nAnd put in every honest hand a whip,\n\nTo lash the rascal naked through the world, [145]\n\nEven from the east to the west!\n\nIAGO.    Speak within doors.\n\nEMILIA. O, fie upon him! Some such squire he was,\n\nThat turn’d your wit, the seamy side without,\n\nAnd made you to suspect me with the Moor.\n\nIAGO. You are a fool, go to.\n\nDESDEMONA.    O good Iago, [150]\n\nWhat shall I do to win my lord again?\n\nGood friend, go to him, for, by this light of heaven,\n\nI know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:\n\nIf e’er my will did trespass ’gainst his love\n\nEither in discourse of thought or actual deed, [155]\n\nOr that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,\n\nDelighted them in any other form,\n\nOr that I do not yet, and ever did,\n\nAnd ever will (though he do shake me off\n\nTo beggarly divorcement ) love him dearly, [160]\n\nComfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;\n\nAnd his unkindness may defeat my life,\n\nBut never taint my love. I cannot say “whore”:\n\nIt does abhor me now I speak the word;\n\nTo do the act that might the addition earn [165]\n\nNot the world’s mass of vanity could make me.\n\nIAGO. I pray you, be content, ’tis but his humour,\n\nThe business of the state does him offence,\n\nAnd he does chide with you.\n\nDESDEMONA. If’twere no other, –\n\nIAGO.    ’Tis but so, I warrant you; [170]\n\n(Trumpets.)\n\nHark, how these instruments summon you to supper,\n\nAnd the great messengers of Venice stay:\n\nGo in, and weep not, all things shall be well.\n\n(Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.)\n\n(Enter Roderigo.)\n\nHow now, Roderigo?\n\nRODERIGO. I do not find that thou deal’st justly with me. [175]\n\nIAGO. What in the contrary?\n\nRODERIGO. Every day thou doff est me with some device, Iago, and rather, as it seems to me, thou keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope: I will indeed no longer [180] endure it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered.\n\nIAGO. Will you hear me, Roderigo?\n\nRODERIGO. Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and performance are no kin together. [185]\n\nIAGO. You charge me most unjustly.\n\nRODERIGO. With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of means: the jewels you have had from me, to deliver to Desdemona, would half have corrupted a votarist . You have told me she has [190] receiv’d ’em, and return’d me expectation, and comforts, of sudden respect, and acquittance , but I find none.\n\nIAGO. Well, go to, very well.\n\nRODERIGO. Very well, go to, I cannot go to, man, it is [195] not very well, by this hand, I say ’tis very scurvy, and begin to find myself fopp’d in it.\n\nIAGO. Very well.\n\nRODERIGO. I say it is not very well: I will make myself known to Desdemona; if she will return me my [200] jewels, I will give over my suit, and repent my unlawful solicitation , if not, assure yourself I’ll seek satisfaction of you.\n\nIAGO. You have said now.\n\nRODERIGO. Ay, and I have said nothing but what I [205] protest intendment of doing.\n\nIAGO. Why, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even from this time to build on thee a better opinion than ever before, give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast taken against me a most just exception , but yet I [210] protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affairs.\n\nRODERIGO. It hath not appear’d.\n\nIAGO. I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgement: but, Roderigo, if thou hast that within thee indeed, [215] which I have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean purpose, courage, and valour , this night show it; if thou the next night following enjoyest not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery , and devise engine s for my life. [220]\n\nRODERIGO. Well, is it within reason and compass?\n\nIAGO. Sir, there is especial command come from Venice, to depute Cassio in Othello’s place.\n\nRODERIGO. Is that true? why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice. [225]\n\nIAGO. O no, he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be linger ’d here by some accident, wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.\n\nRODERIGO. How do you mean, removing of him? [230]\n\nIAGO. Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s place, knocking out his brains.\n\nRODERIGO. And that you would have me to do.\n\nIAGO. Ay, and if you dare do yourself a profit and right, he sups to-night with a harlot , and thither will I go [235] to him; ... he knows not yet of his honourable fortune: if you will watch his going thence, which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one, you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us: come, [240] stand not amaz’d at it, but go along with me, I will show you such a necessity in his death, that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows to waste: about it. [245]\n\nRODERIGO. I will hear further reason for this.\n\nIAGO. And you shall be satisfied.\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nScene 3\n\nAnother Room in the Castle.\n\nEnter Othello, Lodovico, Desdemona, Emilia, and Attendants.\n\nLODOVICO. I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.\n\nOTHELLO. O, pardon me, it shall do me good to walk.\n\nLODOVICO. Madame, good night. I humbly thank your ladyship.\n\nDESDEMONA. Your honour is most welcome.\n\nOTHELLO.    Will you walk, sir? ...\n\nO Desdemona, – [5]\n\nDESDEMONA. My lord?\n\nOTHELLO. Get you to bed, o’ the instant I will be return’d, forthwith , dispatch your attendant there: ... look it be done.\n\nDESDEMONA. I will, my lord. [10]\n\n(Exeunt Othello, Lodovico, and Attendants.)\n\nEMILIA. How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.\n\nDESDEMONA. He says he will return incontinent:\n\nHe hath commanded me to go to bed,\n\nAnd bade me to dismiss you.\n\nEMILIA.    Dismiss me?\n\nDESDEMONA. It was his bidding, therefore, good Emilia, [15]\n\nGive me my nightly wearing , and adieu,\n\nWe must not now displease him.\n\nEMILIA. I would you had never seen him!\n\nDESDEMONA. So would not I, my love doth so approve him,\n\nThat even his stubbornness , his check s and frown s , – [20]\n\nPrithee unpin me, – have grace and favour in them.\n\nEMILIA. I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.\n\nDESDEMONA. All’s one, good faith: how foolish are our minds!\n\nIf I do die before thee, prithee shroud me\n\nIn one of those same sheets.\n\nEMILIA.    Come, come, you talk. [25]\n\nDESDEMONA. My mother had a maid call’d Barbary,\n\nShe was in love, and he she lov’d prov’d mad,\n\nAnd did forsake her; she had a song of “ willow ”,\n\nAn old thing ’twas, but it express’d her fortune,\n\nAnd she died singing it; that song to-night [30]\n\nWill not go from my mind ... I have much to do,\n\nBut to go hang my head all at one side\n\nAnd sing it like poor Barbary: prithee dispatch.\n\nEMILIA. Shall I go fetch your night-gown?\n\nDESDEMONA.    No, unpin me here;\n\nThis Lodovico is a proper man. [35]\n\nEMILIA. A very handsome man.\n\nDESDEMONA. He speaks well.\n\nEMILIA. I know a lady in Venice would have walk’d barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.\n\nDESDEMONA (singing).\n\nThe poor soul sat sighing, by a sycamore tree, [40]\n\nSing all a green willow:\n\nHer hand on her bosom her head on her knee,\n\nSing willow, willow, willow.\n\nThe fresh streams ran by her, and murmur ’d her moan s ,\n\nSing willow, willow, willow. [45]\n\nHer salt tears fell from her, which soften’d the stones: –\n\nLay by these: –\n\nSing willow, willow, willow.\n\nPrithee hie  thee: he’ll come anon: –\n\nSing all a green willow must be my garland . [50]\n\nLet nobody blame him, his scorn I approve, –\n\nNay, that’s not next. Hark! who’s that knocks?\n\nEMILIA. It is the wind.\n\nDESDEMONA.\n\nI call’d my love false love; but what said he then?\n\nSing willow, willow, willow: [55]\n\nIf I court moe women, you’ll couch with moe men.\n\nNow get thee gone; good night: mine eyes do itch ,\n\nDoes that bode weeping?\n\nEMILIA.    ’Tis neither here nor there.\n\nDESDEMONA. I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!\n\nDost thou in conscience think, – tell me, Emilia, – [60]\n\nThat there be women do abuse their husbands\n\nIn such gross kind?\n\nEMILIA.    There be some such, no question.\n\nDESDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed, for all the world?\n\nEMILIA. Why, would not you?\n\nDESDEMONA.    No, by this heavenly light!\n\nEMILIA. Nor I neither, by this heavenly light, [65]\n\nI might do it as well in the dark.\n\nDESDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a thing for all the world?\n\nEMILIA. The world is a huge thing, it is a great price,\n\nFor a small vice.\n\nDESDEMONA. Good troth , I think thou wouldst not.\n\nEMILIA. By my troth, I think I should, and undo ’t [70] when I had done it; marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring ; or for measures of lawn , nor for gown s , or petticoats, nor caps, nor any such exhibition; but, for the whole world? ud’s pity, who would not make her husband a cuckold, to make [75] him a monarch? I should venture  purgatory for it.\n\nDESDEMONA. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong,\n\nFor the whole world.\n\nEMILIA. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i’ the world; and having the world for your labour, ’tis a wrong in [80] your own world, and you might quickly make it right.\n\nDESDEMONA. I do not think there is any such woman.\n\nEMILIA. Yes, a dozen, and as many to the vantage , as would\n\nstore the world they played for. [85]\n\nBut I do think it is their husbands’ faults\n\nIf wives do fall: say, that they slack their duties,\n\nAnd pour our treasures into foreign lap s ;\n\nOr else break out in peevish jealousies,\n\nThrowing restraint upon us: or say they strike us, [90]\n\nOr scant our former having in despite,\n\nWhy, we have galls: and though we have some grace,\n\nYet have we some revenge. Let husbands know,\n\nTheir wives have sense like them: they see, and smell,\n\nAnd have their palates both for sweet, and sour, [95]\n\nAs husbands have. What is it that they do,\n\nWhen they change us for others? Is it sport?\n\nI think it is: and doth affection breed it?\n\nI think it doth. Is ’t frailty that thus errs?\n\nIt is so too. And have not we affections? [100]\n\nDesires for sport? and frailty, as men have?\n\nThen let them use us well: else let them know,\n\nThe ills we do, their ills instruct us so.\n\nDESDEMONA. Good night, good night: God me such usage send,\n\nNot to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend! [105]\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nAct V\n\nScene 1\n\nA Street.\n\nEnter Iago and Roderigo.\n\nIAGO. Here stand behind this bulk , straight will he come,\n\nWear thy good rapier bare, and put it home,\n\nQuick, quick, fear nothing, I’ll be at thy elbow;\n\nIt makes us or it mar s us, think of that,\n\nAnd fix most firm thy resolution . [5]\n\nRODERIGO. Be near at hand, I may miscarry in ’t .\n\nIAGO. Here at thy hand, be bold, and take thy sword.\n\n(Retires.)\n\nRODERIGO. I have no great devotion to the deed;\n\nAnd yet he has given me satisfying reasons,\n\n’Tis but a man gone: forth, my sword, he dies. [10]\n\nIAGO. I have rubb’d this young quat almost to the sense,\n\nAnd he grows angry now: whether he kill Cassio,\n\nOr Cassio him, or each do kill the other,\n\nEvery way makes my game; live Roderigo,\n\nHe calls me to a restitution large, [15]\n\nFor gold and jewels, that I bob b’d from him,\n\nAs gifts to Desdemona:\n\nIt must not be; if Cassio do remain,\n\nHe has a daily beauty in his life,\n\nThat makes me ugly: and besides, the Moor [20]\n\nMay unfold me to him; there stand I in peril :\n\nNo, he must die, be ’t so, I hear him coming.\n\n(Enter Cassio.)\n\nRODERIGO. I know his gait , ’tis he, villain, thou diest!\n\n(Makes a pass at Cassio.)\n\nCASSIO. That thrust had been my enemy indeed,\n\nBut that my coat is better than thou think’st; [25]\n\nI will make proof of thine.\n\n(Draws, and wounds Roderigo.)\n\nRODERIGO.    O, I am slain!\n\n(Iago from behind wounds Cassio in the leg, and exit.)\n\nCASSIO. I am maim’d for ever, light, ho, murder, murder!\n\n(Falls.)\n\n(Enter Othello.)\n\nOTHELLO. The voice of Cassio, Iago keeps his word.\n\nRODERIGO. O villain that I am!\n\nOTHELLO.    Hark, ’tis even so.\n\nCASSIO. O, help, ho! light! a surgeon! [30]\n\nOTHELLO. ’Tis he, O brave Iago, honest and just,\n\nThat hast such noble sense of thy friend’s wrong,\n\nThou teachest me; ... minion , your dear lies dead,\n\nAnd your fate hie s  apace ; strumpet, I come;\n\nForth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted , [35]\n\nThy bed, lust-stain’d, shall with lust’s blood be spotted.\n\n(Exit.)\n\n(Enter Lodovico and Gratiano.)\n\nCASSIO. What ho, no watch, no passage? murder, murder!\n\nGRATIANO. ’Tis some mischance , the cry is very direful .\n\nCASSIO. O, help!\n\nLODOVICO. Hark! [40]\n\nRODERIGO. O wretched villain.\n\nLODOVICO. Two or three groan s ; it is a heavy night,\n\nThese may be counterfeit s , let’s think ’t unsafe\n\nTo come into the cry without more help.\n\nRODERIGO. Nobody come; then shall I bleed to death. [45]\n\n(Enter Iago with a light.)\n\nLODOVICO. Hark!\n\nGRATIANO. Here’s one comes in his shirt, with lights and weapons.\n\nIAGO. Who’s there? whose noise is this, that cries on murder?\n\nLODOVICO. I do not know.\n\nIAGO.    Did not you hear a cry?\n\nCASSIO. Here, here, for heaven’s sake help me!\n\nIAGO.    What’s the matter? [50]\n\nGRATIANO. This is Othello’s ancient, as I take it.\n\nLODOVICO. The same indeed, a very valiant fellow.\n\nIAGO. What are you here, that cry so grievously ?\n\nCASSIO. Iago! O, I am spoil’d, undone by villains,\n\nGive me some help. [55]\n\nIAGO. O, my lieutenant! what villains have done this?\n\nCASSIO. I think the one of them is hereabout,\n\nAnd cannot make away.\n\nIAGO.    O treacherous villains!\n\nWhat are you there? come in and give some help.\n\n(To Lodovico and Gratiano.)\n\nRODERIGO. O, help me here! [60]\n\nCASSIO. That’s one of ’em.\n\nIAGO.    O murderous slave, O villain!\n\n(Stabs Roderigo.)\n\nRODERIGO. O damn’d Iago, O inhuman dog, ... oh, oh, oh.\n\nIAGO. Kill him i’ the dark? Where be those bloody thieves?\n\nHow silent is this town! Ho, murder, murder!\n\nWhat may you be, are you of good or evil? [65]\n\nLODOVICO. As you shall prove us, praise us.\n\nIAGO. Signior Lodovico?\n\nLODOVICO. He, sir.\n\nIAGO. I cry you mercy: here’s Cassio hurt by villains.\n\nGRATIANO. Cassio! [70]\n\nIAGO. How is it, brother?\n\nCASSIO. My leg is cut in two.\n\nIAGO.    Marry, heaven forbid!\n\nLight, gentlemen, I’ll bind it with my shirt.\n\n(Enter Bianca.)\n\nBIANCA. What is the matter, ho? who is ’t that cried?\n\nIAGO. Who is ’t that cried? [75]\n\nBIANCA. O my dear Cassio, O my sweet Cassio!\n\nCassio, Cassio!\n\nIAGO. O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect\n\nWho they should be, that thus have mangle d you?\n\nCASSIO. No. [80]\n\nGRATIANO. I am sorry to find you thus, I have been to seek you.\n\nIAGO. Lend me a garter . So: – O for a chair,\n\nTo bear him easily hence!\n\nBIANCA. Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!\n\nIAGO. Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash [85]\n\nTo bear a part in this: patience awhile, good Cassio:\n\nLend me a light; know we this face, or no?\n\nAlas, my friend, and my dear countryman:\n\nRoderigo? no, – yes, sure: O heaven, Roderigo.\n\nGRATIANO. What, of Venice? [90]\n\nIAGO. Even he, sir, did you know him?\n\nGRATIANO.    Know him? ay.\n\nIAGO. Signior Gratiano, I cry you gentle pardon:\n\nThese bloody accidents must excuse my manners,\n\nThat so neglected you.\n\nGRATIANO.    I am glad to see you.\n\nIAGO. How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair! [95]\n\nGRATIANO. Roderigo!\n\nIAGO. He, ’tis he.\n\n(A chair brought in.)\n\nO, that’s well said, a chair:\n\nSome good man bear him carefully from hence,\n\nI’ll fetch the general’s surgeon: (to Bianca) for you, mistress, [100]\n\nSave you your labour; – he that lies slain here, Cassio,\n\nWas my dear friend, what malice was betwixt you?\n\nCASSIO. None in the world, nor do I know the man.\n\nIAGO (to Bianca) . What, look you pale? – O, bear him out o’ the air.\n\n(Cassio and Roderigo are borne off.)\n\nStay you, good gentlewoman; look you pale, mistress? [105]\n\nDo you perceive the gestures of her eye?\n\nNay, an you stir, – we shall have more anon:\n\nBehold her well I pray you, look upon her,\n\nDo you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness\n\nWill speak, though tongues were out of use. [110]\n\n(Enter Emilia.)\n\nEMILIA. ’Las , what’s the matter? what’s the matter, husband?\n\nIAGO. Cassio has here been set on in the dark,\n\nBy Roderigo, and fellows that are ’scap’d,\n\nHe’s almost slain, and Roderigo dead.\n\nEMILIA. Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio! [115]\n\nIAGO. This is the fruit of whoring; pray, Emilia,\n\nGo know of Cassio where he supp’d to-night:\n\nWhat, do you shake at that?\n\nBIANCA. He supp’d at my house, but I therefore shake not.\n\nIAGO. O, did he so? I charge you go with me. [120]\n\nEMILIA. Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!\n\nBIANCA. I am no strumpet, but of life as honest\n\nAs you, that thus abuse me.\n\nEMILIA.    As I? faugh , fie upon thee!\n\nIAGO. Kind gentlemen, let’s go see poor Cassio dress’d ;\n\nCome, mistress, you must tell ’s another tale. [125]\n\nEmilia, run you to the citadel,\n\nAnd tell my lord and lady what has happ’d:\n\nWill you go on, I pray? (Aside.) This is the night\n\nThat either makes me, or fordo es me quite.\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nScene 2\n\nA Bedchamber in the Castle.\n\nDesdemona in bed asleep. Enter Othello, with a light.\n\nOTHELLO. It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,\n\nLet me not name it to you, you chaste stars:\n\nIt is the cause, yet I’ll not shed her blood,\n\nNor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,\n\nAnd smooth, as monumental alabaster; [5]\n\nYet she must die, else she’ll betray more men.\n\nPut out the light, and then put out the light:\n\nIf I quench thee, thou flaming minister ,\n\nI can again thy former light restore ,\n\nShould I repent me; but once put out thine, [10]\n\nThou cunning pattern of excelling nature,\n\nI know not where is that Promethean heat\n\nThat can thy light relume : when I have pluck’d the rose,\n\nI cannot give it vital growth again,\n\nIt must needs wither ; I’ll smell it on the tree, [15]\n\n(Kisses her. )\n\nA balmy breath, that doth almost persuade\n\nJustice herself to break her sword: once more:\n\nBe thus, when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,\n\nAnd love thee after: once more, and this the last,\n\nSo sweet was ne’er so fatal: I must weep, [20]\n\nBut they are cruel tears; this sorrow’s heavenly,\n\nIt strikes when it does love: she wakes.\n\nDESDEMONA. Who’s there? Othello?\n\nOTHELLO.    Ay, Desdemona.\n\nDESDEMONA. Will you come to bed, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO. Have you pray’d to-night, Desdemona?\n\nDESDEMONA.    Ay, my lord. [25]\n\nOTHELLO. If you bethink yourself of any crime,\n\n Unreconcil’d as yet to heaven and grace,\n\n Solicit for it straight.\n\nDESDEMONA. Alas, my lord, what may you mean by that?\n\nOTHELLO. Well, do it, and be brief, I will walk by, [30]\n\nI would not kill thy unprepared spirit,\n\nNo, heaven forfend , I would not kill thy soul.\n\nDESDEMONA. Talk you of killing?\n\nOTHELLO.    Ay, I do.\n\nDESDEMONA.        Then heaven\n\nHave mercy on me!\n\nOTHELLO.    Amen, with all my heart!\n\nDESDEMONA. If you say so, I hope you will not kill me. [35]\n\nOTHELLO. Hum!\n\nDESDEMONA. And yet I fear you, for you are fatal then,\n\nWhen your eyes roll so: why I should fear, I know not,\n\n Sin ce guiltiness I know not, but yet I feel I fear.\n\nOTHELLO. Think on thy sins.\n\nDESDEMONA.    They are loves I bear to you. [40]\n\nOTHELLO. And for that thou diest.\n\nDESDEMONA. That death’s unnatural, that kills for loving;\n\nAlas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?\n\nSome bloody passion shakes your very frame,\n\nThese are portent s ; but yet I hope, I hope, [45]\n\nThey do not point on me.\n\nOTHELLO.    Peace, and be still!\n\nDESDEMONA. I will, so, what’s the matter?\n\nOTHELLO. That handkerchief which I so lov’d, and gave thee,\n\nThou gavest to Cassio.\n\nDESDEMONA.    No, by my life and soul,\n\nSend for the man and ask him. [50]\n\nOTHELLO. Sweet soul, take heed, take heed of perjury ,\n\nThou art on thy death-bed.\n\nDESDEMONA.    Ay, but not yet to die.\n\nOTHELLO. Yes, presently:\n\nTherefore confess thee freely of thy sin,\n\nFor to deny each article with oath  [55]\n\nCannot remove, nor choke the strong conceit,\n\nThat I do groan withal: thou art to die.\n\nDESDEMONA. Then Lord have mercy on me!\n\nOTHELLO.    I say, amen.\n\nDESDEMONA. And have you mercy too! I never did\n\nOffend you in my life, ... never lov’d Cassio, [60]\n\nBut with such general warranty of heaven,\n\nAs I might love: I never gave him token.\n\nOTHELLO. By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in his hand:\n\nO perjur’d woman, thou dost stone thy heart,\n\nAnd makest me call what I intend to do [65]\n\nA murder, which I thought a sacrifice;\n\nI saw the handkerchief.\n\nDESDEMONA.    He found it then,\n\nI never gave it him, send for him hither,\n\nAnd let him confess a truth.\n\nOTHELLO.    He hath confess’d.\n\nDESDEMONA. What, my lord? [70]\n\nOTHELLO. That he hath ... us’d thee.\n\nDESDEMONA.    How? unlawfully?\n\nOTHELLO. Ay.\n\nDESDEMONA.    He will not say so.\n\nOTHELLO.         No, his mouth is stopp’d,\n\nHonest Iago hath ta’en order for ’t.\n\nDESDEMONA. My fear interprets then, ...\n\nWhat, is he dead?\n\nOTHELLO.    Had all his hairs been lives, [75]\n\nMy great revenge had stomach for ’em all.\n\nDESDEMONA. Alas, he is betray’d, and I undone.\n\nOTHELLO. O strumpet, ... weepest thou for him to my face?\n\nDESDEMONA. O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not.\n\nOTHELLO. Down, strumpet! [80]\n\nDESDEMONA. Kill me to-morrow, let me live to-night.\n\nOTHELLO. Nay, an you strive, –\n\nDESDEMONA. But half an hour, but while I say one prayer!\n\nOTHELLO. ’Tis too late.\n\n(He stifle s her.)\n\nDESDEMONA. O Lord, Lord, Lord! [85]\n\nEMILIA (within). My lord, my lord! what, ho, my lord, my lord!\n\nOTHELLO. What voice is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?\n\nI that am cruel, am yet merciful,\n\nI would not have thee linger in thy pain, ...\n\nSo, so.\n\nEMILIA (within). What ho, my lord, my lord!\n\nOTHELLO.    Who’s there? [90]\n\nEMILIA (within). O good my lord, I ’ld speak a word with you!\n\nOTHELLO. Yes, ’tis Emilia, by and by: she’s dead:\n\n’Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio’s death;\n\nThe noise was here; ha, no more moving,\n\nStill as the grave: shall she come in? were ’t good? [95]\n\nI think she stirs again; no, what’s the best?\n\nIf she come in, she’ll sure speak to my wife.\n\nMy wife, my wife, my wife; I ha’ no wife;\n\nO, insupportable ! O heavy hour!\n\nMethinks it should be now a huge eclipse  [100]\n\nOf sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe\n\nShould yawn at alteration .\n\nEMILIA (within). I do beseech you I may speak with you, ...\n\nGood my lord!\n\nOTHELLO. I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia. [105]\n\nSoft, by and by; let me the curtains draw.\n\nWhere art thou?\n\n(Unlocks the door.)\n\n(Enter Emilia.)\n\nWhat’s the matter with thee now?\n\nEMILIA. O, my good lord, yonder ’s foul murders done!\n\nOTHELLO. What, now?\n\nEMILIA.    But now, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO. It is the very error of the moon, [110]\n\n She comes more near the earth than she was wont,\n\nAnd makes men mad.\n\nEMILIA. Cassio, my lord, has kill’d a young Venetian,\n\nCall’d Roderigo.\n\nOTHELLO.    Roderigo kill’d,\n\nAnd Cassio kill’d?\n\nEMILIA.    No, Cassio is not kill’d. [115]\n\nOTHELLO. Not Cassio kill’d? then murder ’s out of tune,\n\nAnd sweet revenge grows harsh .\n\nDESDEMONA. O, falsely, falsely murder’d!\n\nEMILIA.    O Lord, what cry is that?\n\nOTHELLO. That? what?\n\nEMILIA. Out and alas! it is my lady’s voice; [120]\n\nHelp, help, ho, help! O lady, speak again,\n\nSweet Desdemona, O sweet mistress, speak!\n\nDESDEMONA. A guiltless death I die.\n\nEMILIA. O, who has done this deed?\n\nDESDEMONA. Nobody, I myself, farewell: [125]\n\n Commend me to my kind lord, O, farewell!\n\n(She dies.)\n\nOTHELLO. Why, how should she be murder’d?\n\nEMILIA.    Alas, who knows?\n\nOTHELLO. You heard her say, herself, it was not I.\n\nEMILIA. She said so, I must needs report a truth.\n\nOTHELLO. She’s like a liar gone to burning hell, [130]\n\n’Twas I that kill’d her.\n\nEMILIA.    O, the more angel she,\n\nAnd you the blacker devil!\n\nOTHELLO. She turn’d to folly , and she was a whore.\n\nEMILIA. Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.\n\nOTHELLO. She was false as water.\n\nEMILIA.    Thou as rash as fire, [135]\n\nTo say that she was false: O, she was heavenly true!\n\nOTHELLO. Cassio did top her, ask thy husband else;\n\nO, I were damn’d beneath all depth in hell,\n\nBut that I did proceed, upon just grounds,\n\nTo this extremity; thy husband knew it all. [140]\n\nEMILIA. My husband?\n\nOTHELLO. Thy husband.\n\nEMILIA. That she was false to wedlock ?\n\nOTHELLO. Ay, with Cassio: nay, had she been true,\n\nIf heaven would make me such another world, [145]\n\nOf one entire and perfect chrysolite ,\n\nI ’ld not have sold her for it.\n\nEMILIA. My husband?\n\nOTHELLO.    Ay, ’twas he that told me first,\n\nAn honest man he is, and hates the slime\n\nThat sticks on filthy deeds.\n\nEMILIA.    My husband? [150]\n\nOTHELLO. What needs this iteration ? woman, I say thy husband.\n\nEMILIA. O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!\n\nMy husband say that she was false!\n\nOTHELLO.    He, woman;\n\nI say thy husband: dost understand the word?\n\nMy friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago. [155]\n\nEMILIA. If he say so, may his pernicious soul\n\nRot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart,\n\nShe was too fond of her most filthy bargain .\n\nOTHELLO. Ha!\n\nEMILIA. Do thy worst, [160]\n\nThis deed of thine is no more worthy heaven,\n\nThan thou wast  worthy her.\n\nOTHELLO.    Peace, you were best.\n\nEMILIA. Thou hast not half the power to do me harm\n\nAs I have to be hurt: O gull , O dolt ,\n\nAs ignorant as dirt; thou hast done a deed ... [165]\n\nI care not for thy sword, I’ll make thee known,\n\nThough I lost twenty lives: help, help, O help!\n\nThe Moor has kill’d my mistress, murder, murder!\n\n(Enter Montano, Gratiano, Iago, and others.)\n\nMONTANO. What is the matter? How now, general?\n\nEMILIA. O, are you come, Iago? you have done well, [170]\n\nThat men must lay their murders on your neck.\n\nALL. What is the matter?\n\nEMILIA. Disprove this villain, if thou be’st a man;\n\nHe says thou told’st him that his wife was false,\n\nI know thou didst not, thou art not such a villain: [175]\n\nSpeak, for my heart is full.\n\nIAGO. I told him what I thought, and told no more\n\nThan what he found himself was apt and true.\n\nEMILIA. But did you ever tell him she was false?\n\nIAGO. I did. [180]\n\nEMILIA. You told a lie, an odious damned lie;\n\nUpon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie!\n\nShe false with Cassio; did you say with Cassio?\n\nIAGO. With Cassio, mistress; go to, charm your tongue.\n\nEMILIA. I will not charm my tongue, I am bound to speak:\n\nMy mistress here lies murder’d in her bed. [186]\n\nALL. O heavens forfend!\n\nEMILIA. And your reports have set the murder on.\n\nOTHELLO. Nay, stare not, masters, it is true indeed.\n\nGRATIANO. ’Tis a strange truth. [190]\n\nMONTANO. O monstrous act!\n\nEMILIA.    Villainy, villainy, villainy!\n\nI think upon ’t: I think I smell ’t: O villainy!\n\nI thought so then: I’ll kill myself for grief:\n\nO villainy, villainy!\n\nIAGO. What, are you mad? I charge you get you home. [195]\n\nEMILIA. Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak,\n\n’Tis proper I obey him, but not now:\n\nPerchance, Iago, I will ne’er go home.\n\nOTHELLO. O! O! O!\n\n(Falling on the bed.)\n\nEMILIA.    Nay, lay thee down, and roar,\n\nFor thou hast kill’d the sweetest innocent [200]\n\nThat e’er did lift up eye.\n\nOTHELLO (rising). O, she was foul:\n\nI scarce did know you, uncle, there lies your niece,\n\nWhose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp’d;\n\nI know this act shows terrible and grim.\n\nGRATIANO. Poor Desdemona, I am glad thy father’s dead; [205]\n\nThy match was mortal to him, and pure grief\n\n Shore his old thread  atwain : did he live now,\n\nThis sight would make him do a desperate turn,\n\nYea, curse his better angel from his side,\n\nAnd fall to reprobation . [210]\n\nOTHELLO. ’Tis pitiful, but yet Iago knows\n\nThat she with Cassio hath the act of shame\n\nA thousand times committed; Cassio confess’d it,\n\nAnd she did gratify his amorous works ,\n\nWith the recognizance and pledge of love, [215]\n\nWhich I first gave her; I saw it in his hand,\n\nIt was a handkerchief; an antique token\n\nMy father gave my mother.\n\nEMILIA. O God, O heavenly God!\n\nIAGO.    Zounds, hold your peace.\n\nEMILIA. ’Twill out, it will: I hold my peace sir, no, [220]\n\nI’ll be in speaking, liberal as the air,\n\nLet heaven, and men, and devils, let ’em all,\n\nAll, all cry shame against me, yet I’ll speak.\n\nIAGO. Be wise, and get you home.\n\nEMILIA.    I will not.\n\n(Iago offers to stab Emilia.)\n\nGRATIANO.    Fie,\n\nYour sword upon a woman? [225]\n\nEMILIA. O thou dull Moor, that handkerchief thou speak’st on,\n\nI found by fortune, and did give my husband;\n\nFor often with a solemn earnestness,\n\nMore than indeed belong’d to such a trifle,\n\nHe begg’d of me to steal it.\n\nIAGO.    Villainous whore! [230]\n\nEMILIA. She gave it Cassio? no, alas, I found it,\n\nAnd I did give ’t my husband.\n\nIAGO. Filth , thou liest!\n\nEMILIA. By heaven I do not, I do not, gentlemen;\n\nO murderous coxcomb ! what should such a fool\n\nDo with so good a woman?\n\nOTHELLO.    Are there no stones in heaven [235]\n\nBut what serves for the thunder? Precious villain!\n\n(He runs at Iago . )\n\n(Iago stabs Emilia.)\n\nGRATIANO. The woman falls, sure he has kill’d his wife.\n\nEMILIA. Ay, ay, O lay me by my mistress’ side.\n\n(Exit Iago . )\n\nGRATIANO. He’s gone, but his wife’s kill’d.\n\nMONTANO. ’Tis a notorious villain; take you this weapon, [240]\n\nWhich I have here recover’d from the Moor:\n\nCome, guard the door without, let him not pass,\n\nBut kill him rather; I’ll after that same villain,\n\nFor ’tis a damned slave.\n\n(Exeunt Montano and Gratiano.)\n\nOTHELLO.    I am not valiant neither,\n\nBut every puny  whipster gets my sword; [245]\n\nBut why should honour outlive honesty?\n\nLet it go all.\n\nEMILIA.    What did thy song bode, lady?\n\nHark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan ,\n\nAnd die in music: (Singing.) Willow, willow, willow .\n\nMoor, she was chaste, she lov’d thee, cruel Moor, [250]\n\nSo come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;\n\nSo speaking as I think, I die, I die.\n\n(She dies.)\n\nOTHELLO. I have another weapon in this chamber,\n\nIt is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook ’s  temper ;\n\nO, here it is; uncle, I must come forth. [255]\n\nGRATIANO (within). If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear;\n\nThou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.\n\nOTHELLO. Look in upon me then, and speak to me,\n\nOr, naked as I am, I will assault thee.\n\n(Enter Gratiano.)\n\nGRATIANO. What is the matter?\n\nOTHELLO.    Behold, I have a weapon, [260]\n\nA better never did itself sustain\n\nUpon a soldier’s thigh: I have seen the day,\n\nThat with this little arm, and this good sword,\n\nI have made my way through more impediments\n\nThan twenty times your stop: but O vain boast, [265]\n\nWho can control his fate? ’tis not so now.\n\nBe not afraid, though you do see me weapon’d:\n\nHere is my journey’s end, here is my butt ,\n\nAnd very sea-mark of my utmost sail.\n\nDo you go back dismay’d ? ’tis a lost fear: [270]\n\nMan but a rush against Othello’s breast,\n\nAnd he retires. Where should Othello go?\n\nNow: how dost thou look now? O ill-starr’d wench,\n\nPale as thy smock , when we shall meet at count ,\n\nThis look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven, [275]\n\nAnd fiends will snatch at it: cold, cold, my girl,\n\nEven like thy chastity ; O cursed slave!\n\nWhip me, you devils,\n\nFrom the possession of this heavenly sight,\n\nBlow me about in winds, roast me in sulphur, [280]\n\nWash me in steep-down  gulf s of liquid fire!\n\nO Desdemona, Desdemona dead,\n\nOh, oh, oh.\n\n(Enter Lodovico, Montano, Officers with Iago, prisoner, and Cassio in a chair.)\n\nLODOVICO. Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?\n\nOTHELLO. That’s he that was Othello; here I am. [285]\n\nLODOVICO. Where is this viper? bring the villain forth.\n\nOTHELLO. I look down towards his feet, but that’s a fable,\n\nIf that thou be’st a devil, I cannot kill thee.\n\n(Wounds Iago . )\n\nLODOVICO. Wring his sword from him.\n\nIAGO.    I bleed, sir, but not kill’d.\n\nOTHELLO. I am not sorry neither, I ’ld have thee live, [290]\n\nFor in my sense ’tis happiness to die.\n\nLODOVICO. O thou Othello, that wert once so good,\n\nFall’n in the practice of a damned slave,\n\nWhat should be said to thee?\n\nOTHELLO.    Why, anything,\n\nAn honourable murderer, if you will: [295]\n\nFor nought did I in hate, but all in honour.\n\nLODOVICO. This wretch hath part confess’d his villainy:\n\nDid you and he consent in Cassio’s death?\n\nOTHELLO. Ay.\n\nCASSIO. Dear general, I did never give you cause. [300]\n\nOTHELLO. I do believe it, and I ask you pardon;\n\nWill you, I pray, demand that demi-devil\n\nWhy he hath thus ensnar’d my soul and body?\n\nIAGO. Demand me nothing, what you know, you know,\n\nFrom this time forth I never will speak word. [305]\n\nLODOVICO. What, not to pray?\n\nGRATIANO. Torment s will ope your lips.\n\nOTHELLO. Well, thou dost best.\n\nLODOVICO. Sir, you shall understand what hath befall’n,\n\nWhich, as I think, you know not: here is a letter,\n\nFound in the pocket of the slain Roderigo; [310]\n\nAnd here another; the one of them imports\n\nThe death of Cassio; to be undertook\n\nBy Roderigo.\n\nOTHELLO. O villain!\n\nCASSIO.    Most heathenish , and most gross!\n\nLODOVICO. Now here’s another discontented paper, [315]\n\nFound in his pocket too, and this, it seems,\n\nRoderigo meant to have sent this damned villain,\n\nBut that, belike , Iago in the nick\n\nCame in, and satisfied him.\n\nOTHELLO.    O the pernicious caitiff !\n\nHow came you, Cassio, by a handkerchief, [320]\n\nThat was my wife’s?\n\nCASSIO.    I found it in my chamber,\n\nAnd he himself confess’d it even now,\n\nThat there he dropp’d it, for a special purpose,\n\nWhich wrought to his desire.\n\nOTHELLO.    O fool, fool, fool!\n\nCASSIO. There is besides in Roderigo’s letter [325]\n\nHow he upbraid s Iago, that he made him\n\n Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came\n\nThat I was cast ; and even but now he spake,\n\nAfter long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,\n\nIago set him on. [330]\n\nLODOVICO. You must forsake this room, and go with us,\n\nYour power and your command is taken off,\n\nAnd Cassio rules in Cyprus: for this slave,\n\nIf there be any cunning cruelty,\n\nThat can torment him much, and hold him long, [ 335]\n\nIt shall be his: you shall close prisoner rest,\n\nTill that the nature of your fault be known\n\nTo the Venetian state; come, bring him away.\n\nOTHELLO. Soft you, a word or two:\n\nI have done the state some service, and they know ’t; [340]\n\nNo more of that: I pray you in your letters,\n\nWhen you shall these unlucky deeds relate ,\n\nSpeak of them as they are; nothing extenuate ,\n\nNor set down aught in malice; then must you speak\n\nOf one that lov’d not wisely, but too well: [345]\n\nOf one not easily jealous, but being wrought,\n\nPerplex’d in the extreme; of one whose hand,\n\nLike the base Indian , threw a pearl away,\n\nRicher than all his tribe: of one whose subdued eyes,\n\n Albeit unused to the melting mood, [350]\n\nDrops tears as fast as the Arabian trees\n\nTheir medicinal gum ; set you down this,\n\nAnd say besides, that in Aleppo once,\n\nWhere a malignant and a turban’d Turk\n\nBeat a Venetian, and traduc’d the state, [355]\n\nI took by the throat the circumcised dog,\n\nAnd smote him thus.\n\n(Stabs himself.)\n\nLODOVICO. O bloody period!\n\nGRATIANO.    All that’s spoke is marr’d.\n\nOTHELLO. I kiss’d thee ere I kill’d thee, no way but this,\n\nKilling myself, to die upon a kiss. [360]\n\n(Falls on the bed, and dies.)\n\nCASSIO. This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon,\n\nFor he was great of heart.\n\nLODOVICO (to Iago) .    O Spartan dog ,\n\nMore fell than anguish , hunger, or the sea,\n\nLook on the tragic lodging of this bed:\n\nThis is thy work, the object poisons sight, [365]\n\nLet it be hid: Gratiano, keep the house,\n\nAnd seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,\n\nFor they succeed to you: to you, lord governor,\n\nRemains the censure of this hellish villain,\n\nThe time, the place, the torture : O, enforce it! [370]\n\nMyself will straight aboard, and to the state\n\nThis heavy act with heavy heart relate.\n\n(Exeunt.)\n\nEditorische Notiz\n\nDer englische Text folgt der Ausgabe: William Shakespeare, Othello , hrsg. von M. R.

Das Stück war ein großer Publikumserfolg und übertraf mit seinen immer wieder angesetzten Aufführungen die anderen großen Tragödien des Autors. Mehr noch: Es regte, zusammen mit Hamlet (1602), so viele Nachahmungen an, dass wir heute zusammenfassend von einer besonderen dramatischen Gattung, der sogenannten ›jakobäischen Rachetragödie‹ sprechen.\n\nDie Hauptrolle fiel zu Shakespeares Lebzeiten seinem Freund und Schauspielerkollegen Richard Burbage zu, der als »grieved Moor« seine Zuschauer offenbar nachhaltig ­beeindruckte. Für Richard Flatters Behauptung, dass kein Geringerer als Shakespeare selbst die Rolle des Iago übernahm – eine sehr verlockende Vermutung –, haben wir allerdings keinen Beleg. Vielmehr scheint diese als Komplementärfigur konzipierte Rolle eher mit John Lowin besetzt gewesen zu sein, der auch in Hamlet (Titelrolle Rich­ard Burbage) eine wichtige Komplementärrolle (Clau­dius) übernahm.\n\nDie einzige das Stück in seiner Gesamtheit verwerfende Kritik stammt aus dem Jahre 1693. Thomas Rymer schrieb damals: »There is in this play some burlesk, some humour and ramble of Comical Wit, some shew and some Mimickry to divert the spectators: but the tragical part is plainly none other than a Bloody Farce, without salt or savour.«\n\nSeit dem 18. Jahrhundert ist Othello hingegen bei Kritikern und Publikum gleichermaßen beliebt, was zweifellos auf die unter den Tragödien Shakespeares einmalig gelungene Verbindung von kompakter Handlung und unerschöpflich erscheinendem Aussagepotenzial zurückzuführen ist. Wie kein anderes Shakespearestück ruft es beim Zuschauer spontane Reaktionen hervor. Iagos Auftritte sind in der Vergangenheit oft mit Zischen, lauten Protesten und gar mit direkten, an Othello gerichteten Warnrufen begleitet worden. Immerhin ist das Publikum heute bereit, die schauspielerische Leistung des Iago-Darstellers am Schluss mit Beifall zu honorieren.\n\nDieser gewandelten Einstellung der Zuschauer entsprechen auch veränderte Inszenierungen und literaturkritische Bewertungen von Othello. Das Stück, so will es scheinen, bedarf keiner Adaptionen wie die anderen Tragödien und ist, mehr als Macbeth und wohl auch Hamlet , eher für die heutige Zeit geschrieben worden. Wir sehen in Othello Bezüge, die Shakespeares Zeitgenossen aufgrund eines völlig anderen Weltbildes entgingen. Und so haben wir in den letzten 100 Jahren Inszenierungen zu verzeichnen, die uns zunächst überraschen, aber vom Text selbst her durchaus begründbar sind. In einer Inszenierung von 1935 wurden die Beziehungen zwischen Othello (Ralph Richardson) und Iago (Laurence Olivier) als homosexuelles Verhältnis interpretiert. Laurence Olivier begegnet uns erneut, dieses Mal als Othello, in einer Inszenierung aus dem Jahre 1964. Hier erscheint Othello – ungemein aktuell – mit karibischem Akzent und Gehabe, während Iago (Frank Finlay) mit seinem nordenglischen Dialekt Provinzialismus, Nonkonformismus und Aufsteigertum suggeriert. Gerade Iagos Rolle lässt eine ungewöhnliche interpretatorische Vielfalt zu, so dass ihr dramatisches Potenzial keineswegs ausgeschöpft ist. Die Literaturkritik hat hier ein erhebliches Maß an Vorleistungen erbracht, deren dramaturgische Umsetzung noch Jahrzehnte dauern wird.\n\nDie erste Textfassung von Othello , eine Quartausgabe (Q1 – 1622), erschien relativ spät, unmittelbar gefolgt von der ersten Gesamtausgabe des Shakespeareschen Werkes (Folio 1 – 1623). Wir wissen nicht, ob der Folio-Text einer anderen Vorlage entnommen wurde. Die Unterschiede sind, verglichen mit anderen Stücken, nicht sehr groß. In der Folio-Fassung finden wir weniger Flüche, offenbar eine Konzession an ein Gesetz aus dem Jahre 1606, welches dem Theater entsprechende Auflagen machte. Außerdem ist der Folio-Text insgesamt 160 Zeilen länger als die erste Quartausgabe, die interessanterweise mehr Bühnenanweisungen enthält. Eine weitere Quartausgabe (Q2) liegt aus dem Jahr 1630 vor. Hier sind die jeweils fehlenden Elemente der vorhergehenden Ausgabe einbezogen worden. Die Tatsache, dass Othello zu einer Zeit, als das Theater nur noch eine geringe Bedeutung hatte, noch einmal als Einzeltext aufgelegt wurde, spricht für das ungebrochene Ansehen des Stückes.\n\nMit der Wahl eines venezianischen Stoffes traf Shake­speare erneut den zeitgenössischen Publikumsgeschmack. Bereits 1596/97 hatte er im Merchant of Venice mit geographisch und soziologisch interessanten Dimensionen experimentiert, die auch in Othello wieder auftauchen. In beiden Stücken ist der wegen seiner Exotik faszinierende Handlungsort durch einen Außenstehenden mit einem besonderen Spannungsverhältnis versehen worden. Venedig, über dessen politische Verfassung Shakespeare sich vermutlich in Kardinal Contarinis Commonwealth and Government informierte, ist offenbar auf den Bankier ­Shylock und noch mehr auf den Berufssoldaten Othello ­angewiesen. Trotzdem ist die Republik keine offene Gesellschaft, weder für den Juden Shylock, der die Integration nicht sucht, noch für den ›Mohren‹ Othello, der sein militärisches Renommee mit Gleichberechtigung verwechselt.\n\nVenedig genoss im England des 16. und 17. Jahrhunderts ein wegen seiner freistaatlichen Verfassung, der in seinem Herrschaftsbereich garantierten religiösen Toleranz, wegen seiner ausgedehnten Handelsbeziehungen und nicht zuletzt wegen seines permanenten Abwehrkampfes gegen die Türken hohes Ansehen. Gleichzeitig war Venedig auch ein Teil jenes Italienbildes, das sich vom 16. zum 17. Jahrhundert zunehmend verdunkelte. Der in den Komödien vermittelte Eindruck von Schönheit, Lebensfreude und höherer Kultur wurde nach und nach von einem anderen Klischeebild verdrängt, welches sich zuweilen auch vorher schon manifestiert hatte. Dieses Italien war das Land des Macchiavellismus, der Intrige, der politischen und moralischen Korruption, des teuflisch erscheinenden Papsttums und der Destruktion aus Motiven, die sich einer einfachen Begründung entziehen.\n\nShakespeares Quelle war eine 1566 in Venedig von Giovanni Battista Giraldo Cinthio unter dem Titel Hecatommithi veröffentlichte Sammlung von Geschichten, deren Weg nur bis Frankreich belegt ist. Gegen die Vermutung, dass Shakespeare eine englische Übersetzung zur Verfügung hatte, spricht die Tatsache, dass sein Text weniger wörtlich mit der Vorlage übereinstimmt, als dies etwa bei den Historien oder Römerdramen der Fall ist.\n\nCinthios Geschichte wurde von Shakespeare erheblich verändert und auch erweitert. Die in der Vorlage angege­benen Motive und Handlungsstränge sind einfach und direkt; sie sollten jedoch auch dort nicht übergangen werden, wo Shakespeares Text offenkundig von ihnen abweicht. Dieser Hinweis gilt insbesondere für die Frage nach Iagos Motiven.\n\nIn Cinthios Novelle ist der Fähnrich (Shakespeares Iago) in Disdemona (sic!) verliebt, kann sie aber aus Angst vor dem ›Mohren‹ (der bei Cinthio namenlos bleibt) nicht unmittelbar ansprechen. Disdemona nimmt keine Notiz von seinen vorsichtigen Annäherungsversuchen, woraufhin der Fähnrich vermutet, dass sie statt seiner Person den Hauptmann (Shakespeares Cassio) liebt. Der Fähnrich sinnt auf Rache. Der Hauptmann soll sterben, und, wenn ihm, dem Fähnrich, Disdemona verwehrt ist, soll auch der Mohr sie verlieren. Als der Hauptmann wegen eines Disziplinarverfahrens degradiert wird, setzt sich Disdemona ihrem Gatten gegenüber allzu nachdrücklich für ihn ein. Der Mohr erzählt dem Fähnrich von diesem Übereifer seiner Frau und bringt ihn damit auf den eigentlichen Rachegedanken. Mit Suggestivfragen weckt der Fähnrich den Argwohn des Mohren. Später unterstellt er Disdemona eine rassisch bedingte Abscheu vor ihrem Gatten, eine Verdächtigung, die den Mohren vollends aus dem Gleichgewicht geraten lässt. Zunächst ist jedoch der Fähnrich selbst in Gefahr. Der Mohr droht ihm ein böses Ende an für den Fall, dass die aufgestellten Behauptungen nicht zutreffen. Er verlangt einen sichtbaren Beweis für Disdemonas Untreue. Mit Hilfe seiner dreijährigen Tochter gelingt es dem Fähnrich, Disdemonas Taschentuch, ein wertvolles Geschenk des Mohren, zu entwenden und in den Besitz des Hauptmanns zu bringen. Als der Mohr das Taschentuch, nachdem er Disdemona vergeblich danach gefragt hatte, unter geschickter Anleitung des Fähnrichs im Haus des Hauptmanns sieht, ist für ihn der geforderte Beweis erbracht. Er bittet den Fähnrich, den Hauptmann zu töten. Der weisungsgemäß eingeleitete Anschlag gelingt jedoch nur zum Teil. Disdemona wird sodann vom Mohren und dem Fähnrich gemeinsam mit einem sandgefüllten Strumpf erschlagen. Der Mord wird anschließend durch Zerstörung des Hauses verdeckt. Nach der Tat ist der Mohr so sehr von Kummer geplagt, dass er nunmehr den Fähnrich zu hassen beginnt. Er enthebt ihn seiner Funktionen. Dieser rächt sich, indem er den – überlebenden – Hauptmann zu einem Gerichtsverfahren gegen den Mohren anstachelt. Der Mohr gesteht schließlich unter der Folter seine Tat. Er wird lebenslänglich aus Venedig verbannt und von Disdemonas Verwandten getötet. Der Fähnrich entgeht zunächst seiner Bestrafung und kann eine Zeitlang weitere Opfer verfolgen, wird letztlich aber auch festgenommen und stirbt unter der Folter.\n\nDie zentralen Handlungsepisoden der Novelle von Cinthio, in denen die Verführung des Mohren durch seinen Fähnrich dargestellt wird, entsprechen teilweise sehr genau der Handlung in Shakespeares Tragödie. Für den ersten und den letzten Akt finden wir hingegen nur wenige Parallelen in der Quelle.\n\nDie von Shakespeare erdachten Namen von zwei Prot­agonisten sind bezeichnenderweise nicht mit Italien, sondern mit Spanien assoziiert. Iago (Santiago – der Heilige Jakob) hatte als spanischer Nationalheiliger und als Bezugs­figur für die mehrere Jahrhunderte dauernde Reconquista den Beinamen »Matamoros« (›Mohren‹- oder ›Mauren­töter‹), während der Name Roderigo sowohl an den letzten Westgotenkönig Roderich als auch an den spanischen Na­tionalhelden des Mittelalters Roderigo Diaz (El Cid) er­innert.\n\nDer Name der Titelfigur ist hingegen keiner historischen Gestalt zuzuordnen. »Othello« ist eine italienische Diminutivform von »Otho«, einem römischen Kaiser, dessen Büste eine Abteilung der Cottonian Library ziert und Kennern der mittelenglischen Literatur noch heute als Orientierungshilfe dient. Diese in London aufbewahrte wert­volle Sammlung alter Handschriften aus den Beständen aufgelöster Klöster war zur Shakespearezeit bekannt. Ein direkter Bezug zu Shakespeare ist jedoch bislang nicht nachgewiesen worden.\n\nDie erste Szene von Shakespeares Othello ist eine typische Expositionsszene, in der der Titelheld zunächst nicht auftritt. Stattdessen sehen wir zwei Figuren, den Aristokraten Roderigo und den Fähnrich Iago, den wir weder hier noch später im Stück definitiv einer bestimmten Stufe in der gesellschaftlichen Hierarchie zuordnen können. Iago führt sich mit einem vulgären Fluch (»’Sblood«) ein, der sich deutlich von Roderigos fast höflichem »Tush« abhebt. Iago kann es sich offenbar erlauben, Roderigo in rüder Weise zu antworten. Wir merken sehr bald, dass Roderigo ein Tölpel ist, der sich von Iago missbrauchen und ausbeuten lässt. Zu Iagos Eigenschaften gehört unter anderem ein handfester materieller Erwerbstrieb, der die Veruntreuung der ihm von Roderigo für Desdemona überlassenen Werte einschließt. Iago ist Ökonom. Er sorgt nicht nur für sich selbst und gebraucht sehr häufig kommerzielle Termini (»sell«, »buy«, »profit«, »dear«, »purse«, »enrich«, »jewels«, »gold«), sondern berät am Ende von Akt I auch Roderigo für das kommende Unternehmen (»put money enough in your purse«).\n\nIagos Erwerbstrieb war für Shakespeares Zeitgenossen ebenso vulgär und verdächtig wie sein von ihm selbst vorgebrachtes Aufstiegsmotiv. Für viele Kritiker ist Iagos Enttäuschung darüber, dass er bei der Ernennung des stellvertretenden Befehlshabers zu Unrecht übergangen worden sei, nur ein Ad-hoc-Argument zur Beschwichtigung Roderigos. Bradleys Warnung, keiner Aussage Iagos Glauben zu schenken, solange sie nicht durch Tatsachen oder Wiederholungen gedeckt sei, hat viele Kritiker dazu verleitet, Iagos Motive auf einige wenige zu reduzieren. Ist deshalb das von ihm selbst vorgetragene Aufstiegsmotiv nicht echt, zumal er selbst nur einmal kurz (I,3,392) und zweimal eher indirekt (II,1,174 und 277) darauf zurückkommt, und außerdem niemand auf seine Enttäuschung eingeht? Letzterem wäre entgegenzuhalten, dass Iago als Person für alle anderen Figuren bezeichnenderweise uninteressant ist. Dies entspricht der traditionellen dramatischen Konvention, derzufolge nur Personen höheren Standes als Charaktere von Interesse sind. Zu dieser Gruppe rechnet Iago zweifellos nicht, wie die Kritiker einhellig feststellen. Wir erfahren nichts über seine Herkunft, und er ist ganz sicher nicht der Typ des degenerierten Aristokraten, den wir in Falstaff erkennen. Die Stellung seiner Frau Emilia ist ebenfalls nicht genau definiert, doch erscheint sie uns eher als Bedienstete Desdemonas denn als auch nur annähernd gleichberechtigte Figur. Über Iagos Bildung erfahren wir indirekt etwas in seiner ersten Rede. Für den erfolgreichen Florentiner Cassio hat er nur Verachtung übrig, denn dieser hat ihm offenbar einiges an theoretischer Bildung (»book­ish theoric«) voraus, während Iago für sich Erfahrung und Praxis reklamiert. Doch ist es nicht nur Bildungsneid, den Iago für den Aristokraten Cassio empfindet. Es ist ein grober Klassenhass, der den Lebensstil der Aristokratie und die von ihr gesetzten ästhetischen Normen als anstößig empfindet. Iago hat Cassio gegenüber Minderwertigkeitskomplexe. Wenn er ihn als »proper man« bezeichnet, so ist dies vordergründig ironisch, aber gleichzeitig auch Ausdruck seines Neides. Noch deutlicher ist Iagos expliziter Vergleich in Akt V:\n\n»He has a daily beauty in his life,\n\nThat makes me ugly: […]« (V,1,19 f.).\n\nIagos Hass auf das Schöne ist ebenso wie sein Aufstiegsmotiv Ausdruck seines diabolischen Charakters, denn geläufiger Auffassung zufolge konnte nur der Teufel ein Interesse an der Zerstörung der Ordnung, die sich als Schönheit manifestierte, haben.\n\nBei seinem ersten Auftritt kann sich Iago mehr Ehrlichkeit erlauben als später, denn er hat nur den tölpelhaften Roderigo vor sich. Diese von Shakespeare eigens geschaffene Figur erfüllt im übrigen fast ausschließlich einen dra­matischen Zweck. An ihr kann Iago dem Zuschauer gegenüber seine Manipulationskünste vorführen, und sie dient gleichzeitig zur Steigerung der Spannung, denn Iago erweist sich bald als allzu selbstsicherer Schurke. Roderigo schöpft nach und nach Verdacht und muss schließlich von Iago kaltblütig ermordet werden. Seine dramatische Funktion wird sodann von Emilia übernommen. Sie, Iagos Frau, ist es, die am Schluss die Intrige erkennt und mutig aufdeckt. Iago täuscht sich mithin bei Figuren, die er nicht ernst nimmt.\n\nEin weiteres Motiv für Iagos Handeln glaubt etwa Elliott bereits in seiner ersten Aussage zu erkennen. Im Gegensatz zu Cassio ist Iago von Othellos Heirat ebenso überrascht worden wie Roderigo und – so Elliott – dadurch zutiefst gekränkt worden. Das Argument ist, auf sich gestellt und nur auf diese und eine weitere Stelle (I,2,20) bezogen, kaum überzeugend und vermag nur dann sinnvoll zu erscheinen, wenn wir, wie die bereits erwähnte Inszenierung aus den dreißiger Jahren, ein homosexuelles Verhältnis zwischen Othello und Iago unterstellen. Eine von Heilman zitierte psychoanalytische Deutung des Stückes geht davon aus, dass Iago für Desdemona besonders intensive Hassgefühle empfindet, weil sie ihm nicht nur Othello, sondern auch Cassio streitig macht.\n\nIagos erste längere Rede endet mit seinem bekanntesten Ausspruch: »I am not what I am« (I,1,65). Von dieser Stelle an weiß der Zuschauer, dass Iagos wahre Identität für seine Umwelt verborgen bleibt. Iago ist Schauspieler. Eines seiner Lieblingswörter ist »show«. In einem der für ihn typischen Selbstgespräche, die gleichermaßen für die Zuschauer wie für ihn selbst bestimmt sind, spricht er gar von »heavenly shows« (II,3,345). Wir haben in diesem Stück mehr als das bei Shakespeare häufige ›Theater im Theater‹, das primär an andere Figuren des jeweiligen Stückes adressiert ist. Allerdings ist es nicht so, dass Iago seine Opfer einfach von seinem selbst inszenierten Drama ausschließt. Im Gegenteil: Er fordert Othello immer wieder auf, zu ›sehen‹, ein bereits in Cinthios Novelle ansatzweise vorhandenes Element. W. H. Auden sieht Iago als ›Joker in the Pack‹, als eine Figur mithin, die die anderen Figuren mit immer neuen Streichen übertrumpft und durch den Erfolg vom groben Streich bis hin zum Kapitalverbrechen getragen wird. Iagos wiederholter Ausruf »Is ’t possible?« ist Ausdruck dieses Vergnügens an den Leiden der von ihm düpierten Mitspieler. Doch ist Iago mehr als ein bösartig veranlagter Spaßvogel, der von Erfolg zu Erfolg taumelt. Er ist ein Meister der Schauspielkunst, der sich an seinem eigenen Können berauscht. Der Aufstieg, der ihm in der realen Gesellschaft mit ihren starren Konventionen notwendigerweise versagt blieb, ist ihm umso mehr in seiner dramatischen Welt möglich. Hier kann er sein ›vereiteltes Überlegenheitsgefühl‹ (Bradley) befriedigen und sein ›rasendes Verlangen nach Selbsterhöhung‹ (Flatter) stillen. ­Iagos Selbstgespräche sind nicht die reflektierenden Monologe eines Hamlet, sie sind jedoch mehr als dramatisch funktionale Hinweise für die Zuschauer. Iago kann sich hier selbst bewundern: Iago als Narziss.\n\nIagos Schauspielkunst wird bereits in der Expositionsszene deutlich. Er kann sich auf sein Gegenüber einstellen und so seine Gesprächspartner leicht für sich gewinnen. Gegenüber Roderigo kann er sich sogar sehr bald die mokante Anrede »sir« erlauben, ohne dass dieser die Ironie bemerkt. In der Verführungsszene (III,3) treibt Iago Othello gegenüber die der eigenen Belustigung dienende Imitation seines Gesprächspartners so weit, dass selbst Othello es bemerkt.\n\nIago ist nicht nur Schauspieler, sondern auch Regisseur. Er ist es, der die Tragödie Othello inszeniert und dabei seine Regie für den Zuschauer – und für sich selbst – nach und nach entwickelt und verfeinert. Nur wissen seine Akteure nichts von den ihnen zugedachten Rollen. Neben Handlungen, die aufgrund der vorgegebenen Umstände von selbst ablaufen, weist dieses Stück Episoden auf, bei denen Iago als Regisseur eingreifen muss. In der Täuschungsszene (IV,1) arrangiert er den Handlungsablauf so, dass für den eigens geladenen Zuschauer Othello der sichtbare Beweis für Desdemonas Untreue erbracht ist. Die anderen Regieszenen sind nächtliche Unruheszenen, von der Radauszene vor Brabantios Haus (I,1) über die Unruheszene auf Zypern (II,3) bis hin zur blutigen Überfallszene (V,1). Bei allen drei Szenen muss der Regisseur Iago kräftig nachhelfen, um den gewünschten Effekt zu erzielen.\n\nWarum hasst Iago Othello? Dass er ihn hasst, kann wohl kaum bezweifelt werden. Wir erfahren bereits davon in seinem ersten Gespräch mit Roderigo, und Iago bekräftigt diesen Hass mit einer deutlichen Emphase am Ende des ersten Aktes. Wieder ist es Roderigo, dem er sich freimütig offenbart:\n\n»I have told thee often, and I tell thee again, and again, I hate the Moor; my cause is hearted«\n\n (I,3,364–366).\n\nAls Iago dann allein ist, spricht er am Anfang seines ersten großen Monologs dieselben Worte aus, allerdings mit einer kaum glaubhaft erscheinenden Begründung:\n\n»[…] I hate the Moor,\n\nAnd it is thought abroad, that ’twixt my sheets\n\nHe’s done my office; I know not if ’t be true …\n\nYet I, for mere suspicion in that kind,\n\nWill do, as if for surety« (I,3,385–389).\n\nDem aufmerksamen Leser wird die hier merkwürdig erscheinende Standardkonjunktion »and« aufgefallen sein. Iagos Intellekt arbeitet assoziativ. Der – vielleicht allzu freimütigen – Selbstoffenbarung folgt eine deutlich impro­visierte Begründung. Sie taucht als ausdrückliches Rachemotiv Iagos noch einmal auf (II,1,290–294). Ist sie deshalb weniger glaubhaft? Das Stück bietet keinen Anhaltspunkt für eine tatsächliche außereheliche Beziehung zwischen Othello und Emilia. Die Kritik betont zudem Iagos große Menschenkenntnis als Argument dafür, dass er mit diesem Verdacht nur ein Pseudoargument vorbrachte. Außerdem, so lesen wir bei mehreren Kritikern, müsste sich Iagos Rache ebenso gegen Emilia richten. Bei objektiver Betrachtung ist der Verdacht somit für Iago ein Motiv, das ihm zufällig einfiel, als er für seinen Hass eine Begründung suchte. Seit Coleridge spricht die Kritik treffend von ›motive hunting‹ als einem wesentlichen Charakterzug Iagos. Iago ist demnach auf der Suche nach Motiven für sein eigenes Handeln. Seine Einfälle wachsen allerdings über ihren anfänglichen Pseudocharakter hinaus, wie die zweite Stelle deutlich zeigt:\n\n»For that I do suspect the lustful Moor\n\nHath leap’d into my seat, the thought whereof\n\nDoth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards,\n\nAnd nothing can, nor shall content my soul,\n\nTill I am even with him, wife, for wife« (II,1, 292–296).\n\nIago hat inzwischen vergessen, dass dieses Motiv ursprünglich nur ein willkommener Einfall war und ihm eine vordergründige Motivation für seinen Hass lieferte. Aus dem ›bloßen‹, nicht ernstgenommenen Verdacht ist nunmehr eine quälende Besessenheit geworden, die ihm den Weg der Rache zwingend vorschreibt. Iago ist somit nicht einfach der rational-zynische, alles kaltblütig ­planende und ausführende Bösewicht, als der er vor allem in der älteren Kritik dargestellt wird, sondern ein aus­gesprochen schizoider Charakter. Er lebt in zwei Welten, der von ihm objektiv wahrgenommenen realen Umwelt und in einer von ihm selbst gestalteten illusorisch-thea­tralischen Welt, in die hinein er nicht nur andere dank ­seiner suggestiven Fähigkeiten zu zerren vermag. Auch er wird Opfer seiner Suggestion: Iago als Selbst-Verführer.\n\nIn Cinthios Novelle ist ein eifersüchtiges Verlangen nach Desdemona der Grund, der das Vorgehen des Fähnrichs zunächst bestimmt. Wenn wir der großen Mehrheit der Kritiker folgen, so scheidet dieses Motiv für Shakespeares Fähnrich Iago völlig aus. Bei genauerer Betrachtung seiner eigenen Aussagen erweist sich jedoch, dass Cinthios Geschichte nicht so sehr verändert als vielmehr erweitert worden ist. Wiederum ist es die Form der Aussage, die uns eine besondere Aufmerksamkeit abverlangt. In einem längeren assoziativen Monolog am Ende der ersten Szene von Akt II stellt Iago die erotischen Beziehungen zwischen den Hauptfiguren dar. Cassio, so glaubt er, liebt Desdemona; der Mohr wird sich als treuer Gemahl erweisen. Iago fährt dann fort:\n\n»[…] now I do love her too,\n\nNot out of absolute lust, (though peradventure\n\nI stand accountant for as great a sin)\n\nBut partly led to diet my revenge« (II,1,288–291).\n\nWieder sind es die Übergänge zwischen den von Iago ­vorgetragenen Äußerungen, die uns als besonders signi­fikant erscheinen. Iago argumentiert nicht mit logischer Konsequenz, sondern assoziativ improvisierend. Der ­Ausspruch »now I do love her too« will uns gerade deshalb als echte Selbstentlarvung erscheinen, weil er von schwachen, zusammenhanglosen Begründungen gefolgt wird. Die Kommata und die eine gedankliche Parenthese anzeigenden Klammern sind Indiz für Iagos Oszillieren zwischen einem Selbstentlarvungsdrang und abschwächend-verdeckenden Begründungen: Iago als frustrierter Liebhaber. Weitere Belege für seine Liebe zu Desdemona lassen sich unschwer in dem geistreichen Dialog dieser beiden Figuren zu Beginn eben dieser Szene finden. Iagos Antworten sind durchweg mit sexuellen Konnotationen befrachtet. Desdemona nennt ihn abschließend Cassio gegenüber »a most profane and liberal counsellor« (II,1,163 f.). Iagos obszöne Zweideutigkeiten werden daraufhin von Cassio als die einfache Sprache des Ungebildeten entschuldigt. Ob Iago diese Kränkung hört, wissen wir nicht, denn er ist mittlerweile mit etwas anderem beschäftigt. Hasserfüllt beobachtet und kommentiert er die zwischen Cassio und Desdemona ausgetauschten Höflichkeiten. Seine Eifersucht lässt ihn zunächst nur an Rache denken, womit wir erneut an Cinthios Novelle erinnert werden. Dann jedoch gelangen Elemente seines von einer brutalen Sexualität geprägten Unterbewusstseins an die Oberfläche. Es ist bezeichnend für das Ausmaß seiner sexuellen Erregung, dass er die durch Othellos Auftritt unterbrochene sexuelle Thematik im Beisein Roderigos wieder aufnimmt. Hier argumentiert er zunächst mit sexualpsychologischer Nüchternheit, steigert sich dann jedoch zu neurotischen Zwangs­vorstellungen, um sich schließlich mit Abscheu davon zu distanzieren.\n\nWährend Roderigo von Iagos Sexualdiagnosen und Zwangsneurosen unbeeindruckt bleibt, ist Othello nicht gegen sexuelle Suggestionen gefeit. Bei seiner Verführung arbeitet Iago mit Suggestivfragen, die in zunehmendem Maße mit konkreten Vorstellungen angereichert werden. In der ersten Szene des vierten Aktes verliert Othello nach einer erneuten sexuell suggestiven Aussage Iagos über Desdemonas angebliches Verhältnis zu Cassio vollends das Gleichgewicht. Auch Jagos Sadismus ist immer mit sexuellen Konnotationen befrachtet. Es ist wohl nicht verfehlt, seine sexuell-sadistischen Phantastereien und Handlungen als Ausdruck einer Ersatzbefriedigung zu deuten, deren er als frustrierter Liebhaber bedarf. Auch sollte der Stellenwert dieses Motivs nicht zu gering veranschlagt werden, denn Iago stellt sich bereits in der ersten Szene des Stückes damit vor. Er ist es, der Brabantio mit sexuell-sadistischen Grobheiten um seinen Schlaf bringt, und er ist es, der hier und in II,1 als Unruhestifter die Liebesnacht zwischen Othello und Desdemona stört.\n\nZwischen Iagos sexueller Besessenheit als Symptom einer moralischen Korruption sowie seinem Einsatz sexueller Suggestionen zur Verführung Unschuldiger einerseits und der Schlangenmetaphorik des Stückes andererseits bestehen deutliche Bezüge. Emilia spricht im vierten Akt hypothetisch von »serpent’s curse« (IV,2,16), und Lodovico ruft am Ende nach dem Urheber des Unheils mit den Worten »Where is this viper?« (V,2,286). Othello selbst hatte bereits in seiner Beschwörung des Hasses von »aspics’ tongues« (III,3,457) gesprochen: die Giftschlange Iago als Werkzeug des Teufels.\n\nIn der ihrer Ordnung beraubten Welt von Othello wird Gift zum Heilmittel und Iago zum Arzt. Nach Othellos Anfall in IV,1 bemühen sich Cassio und Iago um ihn. Während Cassio nur elementare Sanitäterdienste anbieten kann, stellt Iago eine scheinbar fundierte Diagnose. Andere Fi­guren, Cassio, Roderigo und Bianca, werden von ihm ebenfalls diagnostiziert, wie auch seine Beschreibung und Erklärung heterosexueller Beziehungen zunächst durch klinisch-rationale Nüchternheit gekennzeichnet ist. Es steigert die Tragik des Stückes, dass Dr. Iago nicht nur Othello zu seinen Patienten zählt, sondern auch Desdemona. Sie wendet sich in IV,2 verzweifelt an ihn und wird von ihm wie von einem Arzt beschwichtigt.\n\nAls Typ hat Iago bestimmte dramatische Vorläufer. Da sind einmal die schablonenhaften Figuren »Devil« des Mystery Play und »Vice« des Morality Play. Zum anderen entdecken wir Anleihen beim macchiavellistischen Schurken, wie er uns etwa in Marlowes Jew of Malta begegnet. Als Inkarnation des Bösen ist Iago viel komplexer als seine Vorgänger; in seiner dramatischen Funktion als Bezugsperson ist er jedoch eng an das letztgenannte Vorbild angelehnt. Die eingangs erwähnte neue Gattung der ›jakobäischen Rachetragödie‹ kennt ebenfalls den macchiavellistischen Schurken, der sich und seine Intrigen dem Publikum offenbart. In Shakespeares eigenem Werk ist der macchiavellistische Typ deutlicher bei Richard III und Edmund (in King Lear ) ausgeprägt, denn beide streben nach politischer Macht und beide haben eine Philosophie. Iago hingegen hat nur die ›Philosophie eines Krokodils‹ (Flatter), das darauf bedacht ist, alles Höherstehende zu sich herabzuziehen. Es ist ein besonderes Merkmal dieser Tragödie von Shake­speare, dass sie philosophisch kaum etwas zu bieten hat. Während die Titelfigur geistig anspruchslos ist, hat die Figur des die Ordnung nachhaltig störenden Schurken nur eine zynisch-materialistische Lebensphilosophie vorzuweisen, durch die die etablierten Normen nicht ernsthaft in Frage gestellt werden. Der philosophischen Durchdringung der anderen Tragödien entspricht hier eine umso größere psychologische Tiefe, insbesondere in der Figur Iagos. Zwei Epitheta sind es, die uns bei dieser Figur besonders auffallen. Wie Heilman feststellt, hat Shakespeare die Bezeichnung »slave« fast ausschließlich für Iago reserviert. Das relativ häufige Vorkommen des Wortes lässt den Schluss zu, dass Shakespeare dabei nicht nur das damals geläufige Schimpfwort (›gemeiner Kerl, Hund‹) einsetzen wollte, sondern auch den weiteren konnotativen Bereich (Sklave = Mensch außer- und unterhalb der bestehenden Gesellschaft) einbezog. Die Juxtaposition »honest Iago« fiel bereits Shakespeares Zeitgenossen auf, was kaum verwunderlich ist, denn »honest« kommt mehr als fünfzigmal vor. Es ist kaum denkbar, dass Shakespeare »honest« rein denotativ verstanden wissen wollte. Vordergründig ist zweifellos die denotative Bedeutung ›ehrlich‹ gemeint, denn die Juxtaposition kommt vorzugsweise dort vor, wo Täuschung und Selbsttäuschung besonders offenkundig sind. Vor allem ist es Othello, der im Augenblick des Getäuschtwerdens besonders nachdrücklich seinen Glauben an Iagos Ehrlichkeit zum Ausdruck bringt:\n\n»Iago is most honest« (II,3,6),\n\n»And for I know thou art full of love and honesty«\n\n (III,3,122),\n\n»My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago«\n\n (V,2,155).\n\nIago gelingt es, den mit dem Wort »honest« verbundenen Respekt für sich allein zu beanspruchen und Desdemona durch Infragestellung und Verweigerung eben dieses Attributs ins Zwielicht zu rücken. Spätestens seit Empsons Beitrag wissen wir aber auch, dass »honest« zur Shakespearezeit ein im Bedeutungswandel begriffenes Wort war und dabei auf einem neuen, von den Konventionen befreiten Ehrbegriff basierte. Gleichzeitig – und das erscheint uns bei der Frage nach Iagos Motiven besonders aufschlussreich – wurde »honest« vielfach herablassend gebraucht und implizierte dabei eine gesellschaftliche Beleidigung des Tieferstehenden sowie einen Hinweis auf dessen unzureichende Bildung. Wenn Iago mithin derart häufig, wenngleich unbeabsichtigt, von Othello und anderen Figuren beleidigt wird, erscheint uns das zuvor erwähnte Motiv des Klassenhasses um einen Beleg reicher.\n\nAuch wenn einige Kritiker, insbesondere F. R. Leavis, Motivationsanalysen für unangebracht halten und in Iago nicht mehr als einen dramatisch gelungenen Schurkentyp sehen, so lassen sich Iagos Motive nicht einfach auf grobe Klischees wie ›Werkzeug des Teufels‹ oder ›Inkarnation des Bösen‹ reduzieren. Ein Iago-Darsteller hat deshalb große Schwierigkeiten, will er mehr als nur einen Teil des reichhaltigen Motivkatalogs dieser Figur dramatisch umsetzen. Vielleicht kommt man Iagos Charakter näher, wenn man eine von Bradley eher nebenbei geäußerte These weiter verfolgt: die Tragödie Othello auch als Tragödie Iagos.\n\nDie Tragik des Titelhelden ist, weitaus mehr als bei anderen tragischen Helden Shakespeares, a priori in seiner ­eigenen Person angelegt. Als Vertreter einer anderen Rasse steht Othello von Anfang an in einem Spannungsverhältnis zur venezianischen Normgesellschaft. In jenem ­anderen venezianischen Stück, in The Merchant of Venice , hatte Shakespeare bereits eine exotische Figur, Morocco, auf die Bühne gestellt. Das Gefälle zwischen weißer Normgesellschaft und exotischem Eindringling diente hier nur der Komik, konnte aber auch, wie Cinthios Novelle bereits zeigte, zur Darstellung tragischer Konflikte genutzt werden. Seit der Romantik wurde Shakespeares noble moor vielfach als Nordafrikaner dargestellt, um seine Distanz zur Normgesellschaft zu verkürzen. Vermutlich wurde Shake­speare durch das Erscheinungsbild und das Auftreten einer ­marokkanischen Delegation und ihres Anführers Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud angeregt. Diese diplomatische Mission weilte in der zweiten Hälfte des Jahres 1600 am englischen Hof, um eine Allianz gegen den gemeinsamen Feind Spanien zu schmieden. Shakespeares Truppe, die Lord Chamberlain’s Men, trat während dieser Zeit ebenfalls am Hofe auf. Es ist kaum anzunehmen, dass Shake­speare die Besucher nicht wahrgenommen hat.\n  \n![019882_Abb01.jpg](image/019882_Abb01_fmt.png)\n  \nAbd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud ben Mohammed Anoun, 1600/01 Botschafter Marokkos am Hofe Königin Elizabeth I.\n  \n\n\nDie den literarischen Text historistisch verzerrende romantische Sichtweise ist allerdings wieder aufgegeben worden. Shakespeares Othello ist eindeutig negroid, nennt Roderigo ihn doch gleich zu Beginn des Stückes »the thicklips«. Vermutlich machte Shakespeare bei Plinius ( Naturalis Historia, übersetzt von Philemon Holland) Anleihen für die Charakterisierung seiner Titelfigur. Othello ist im übrigen auch aus poetischen Gründen schwarz. Das Stück ist mit einer ausgeprägten Schwarzweißmetaphorik versehen, die uns insbesondere in Iagos geistreichem Zwiegespräch mit Desdemona in II,1 auffällt. Während die venezianische Aristokratie nur dann ihre rassistischen Vorurteile zugibt, wenn sie sich, wie Brabantio, geschädigt fühlt, artikuliert Iago gleich zu Beginn der Tragödie ein obszönes Konglomerat aus Rassismus, Sadismus und Sexualität. Wir können im nachhinein Iagos Motive für seinen Hass auf Othello um das der rassistischen Voreingenommenheit ergänzen.\n\nOthellos erster Auftritt widerlegt völlig das von Iago suggerierte Negativbild. Sein souveräner Umgang mit Brabantio und dem Dogen lässt uns die Möglichkeit eines tragischen Endes zunächst vergessen. Othello hat zu Beginn des Stückes die realen Höhepunkte seines Lebens erreicht, Desdemona und eine totale militärische Befehlsgewalt. Die Republik Venedig hat ihr Schicksal in seine Hände gelegt. Wir erfahren mehrfach aus Iagos Mund, dass Othello ein edler Charakter ist. Allerdings hat Iago schon eine schwache Stelle entdeckt: Der Mohr ist allzu leichtgläubig. Die Kritik hält Othello für dumm, ungebildet, simpel, naiv und stumpfsinnig, um nur einige Attribute zu zitieren. Die Tragik des Helden liegt mithin in seinem Unvermögen, die reale Welt zu begreifen, begründet. Wird Othello dadurch zur heroischen Figur? Hier gehen die Ansichten der Kritiker weit auseinander. Ausgehend von Cassios Ausspruch »he was great of heart« (V,2,362) unmittelbar nach Othellos Tod, gelangt Flatter gar zu dem Urteil, dass Othellos Ende nicht Elend, Niederlage oder Strafe, sondern ein Sieg sei. Mehr noch: Othello stirbt, so Flatter, den edelsten Tod unter Shakespeares Helden. Bradley hält Othello für den romantischsten aller Shakespeare-Helden, meint damit jedoch eher die Ästhetik der Titelfiguren. Othellos Erscheinung und seine Sprache heben ihn durch ihre Exotik und ihre Poesie deutlich von der Umwelt ab. Was T. S. Eliot für Othellos letzte Rede feststellte, eine bewusste ästhetische Selbstisolierung Othellos gegenüber der Umwelt, mag auch für die ersten Auftritte gelten. Es ist bezeichnend für den anfälligen, von Iago zunehmend infizierten Helden des Stückes, dass er im dritten und vierten Akt zeitweilig die Sprache seines Verführers annimmt, diese dann jedoch dank seiner größeren poetischen Veranlagung noch zu steigern vermag. Othellos sexuell-sadistische Zwangsneurosen übertreffen Iagos Wahnvorstellungen in ihrer Brutalität. In der Mordszene (V,2) hingegen entspricht Othellos Sprache wieder dem, was die Kritik als seine Poesie besonders hervorhebt.\n\nEine Othello eher negativ bewertende Interpretations­linie können wir etwa bei Granville Barker (Othello als ›savage monster‹) und auch bei Heilman konstatieren. Für Heilman ist Othello die am wenigsten heroische Figur unter Shakespeares tragischen Helden. Heilman vermeint zwei Entwicklungsstränge in der Konzeption der Titelfigur zu erkennen, die uns recht aufschlussreich erscheinen, die Tragik des geistig Zurückgebliebenen und Elemente des späteren bürgerlichen Trauerspiels. Heilman geht bei seiner ersten These von Othellos naiv-stumpfsinnigem Wesen aus, das auch von anderen Kritikern keineswegs geleugnet wird. Es ist in diesem Zusammenhang bezeichnend, dass Othello, verglichen mit anderen Titelfiguren der shakespeareschen Tragödie, relativ wenige Monologe hat. Zudem sind seine Reden noch weniger reflektierend als Iagos Selbstgespräche. Othello, so Heilman, ist im Vergleich zu Macbeth, Antony und Hamlet ein Kind. Shakespeare war damals offenbar an der Diskrepanz zwischen Alter und geistiger Entwicklung als tragischem Konflikt interessiert und entwickelte dieses Motiv in King Lear bis an die Grenze des Möglichen.\n\nHeilmans zweite These ist in ihrem Ansatz mit T. S. Eliots bereits referierter Wertung Othellos als Flucht in den Ästhetizismus verwandt, zumal sie ebenfalls vom Ende des Stückes ausgeht. Für Heilman ist Othellos Versuch am Schluss der Tragödie, seine heroischen Taten von einst in Erinnerung zu rufen, ein Indiz einer neuen tragischen Konzeption, die sich schließlich im bürgerlichen Trauerspiel kristallisierte. Wir sollten in Parenthese anmerken, dass Othello bereits im ersten Akt indirekt über seine heroisch-exotischen Abenteuer berichtet. Dieser ›romantische Historiker seiner selbst‹, so Heilman, ist Vorläufer des späteren bürgerlichen Helden.\n\nTragisch ist auch Desdemonas Schicksal. Auch sie vermag nicht die drohende Gefahr zu erkennen und wendet sich, wie wir gesehen haben, ausgerechnet an Iago mit der Bitte um Aufklärung. Insofern hat J. McLauchlan recht, wenn sie Othellos mangelnde Kenntnis seiner Gattin mit Desdemonas mangelnder Kenntnis ihres Gatten vergleicht und diese wechselseitige Unkenntnis als tragisches Element des Stückes hervorhebt. Desdemona kann von Iago nur getäuscht, aber nicht verführt werden, weil ihre Liebe zu Othello total ist. Ihr Schicksal ist das Martyrium einer Heiligen, denn sie wird nicht zufällig mit dem Epitheton »blessed« belegt. Desdemona geht im Bewusstsein der eigenen Unschuld in den Tod und zeigt auch am Ende nur Liebe für ihren Mörder, wie ihre letzten Worte bezeugen: »Commend me to my kind lord, O, farewell!« (V,2,126). Wie sehr Shakespeare bei der Gestaltung der weiblichen Hauptfigur an die christliche Tradition dachte, geht auch aus der dramatischen Anlage der Mordszene hervor. Desdemona wird ermordet und kommt noch einmal zu Bewusstsein: Martyrium und, wenn man einigen Kritikern folgt, Auferstehung.\n\nDie Tragödie Othello ist ein Stück, dessen poetische Elemente im Rahmen der vorhergehenden Charakteranalyse nur gelegentlich Erwähnung fanden. Mit Hilfe der Konkordanz können wir die umfangreiche Metaphorik dieses Dramas systematisch erfassen. Wir stellen dabei fest, dass Othello relativ viele durchgehende metaphorische Bezüge aufweist, ohne deren Berücksichtigung das Stück schwerlich adäquat interpretiert werden kann. Wie bei anderen Shakespeare-Dramen sind die wichtigsten Metaphern antithetisch konzipiert. Sie lassen mithin auf Spannungsverhältnisse schließen, die im vordergründigen Handlungs­ablauf nur teilweise erkennbar oder ganz verdeckt sind. Die wichtigsten Metaphern sind: Himmel und Hölle; Licht und Dunkelheit; Tag und Nacht; schwarz und weiß; Heilung und Krankheit; Musik und Unruhe; See, Sturm, Krieg; Feuer, Flamme, Fackel (Iago und später – in Akt V – auch Othello als Luzifer!).\n\nWir wollen abschließend auf eine Wertung dieser Tragödie verzichten und auch der Versuchung widerstehen, den von der Kritik vorgeschlagenen Gattungsbezeichnungen (u. a. ›tragedy of passion‹, ›tragedy of consuming love and consuming hate‹) eine weitere hinzuzufügen. Eine ­kritische Stellungnahme zu diesem Stück wäre jedoch unvollständig, wenn wir – fasziniert durch das reiche, den Geist der Shakespearezeit sprengende Aussagepotenzial – die formale Nähe zur aristotelischen Norm nicht würdigen würden. Von Shakespeares großen Tragödien kommt Othello den geforderten Einheiten von Zeit, Ort und Handlung am nächsten. Es verwundert daher nicht, dass ein so streng auf klassische Normen achtender Kritiker wie Samuel Johnson seiner Interpretation eine bescheidene Warnung vorausschickte: »The beauties of this play impress themselves so strongly upon the attention of the reader, that they can draw no aid from critical illustration.«\n\nDieter Hamblock\n  \n\n# Hinweise zur E-Book-Ausgabe\n\nDie E-Books des Reclam Verlags verwenden entsprechend der jeweiligen Buchausgabe Sperrungen zur Hervorhebung von Textpassagen.

The play begins in Venice, where Iago, a subordinate of Othello’s and a captain in the Venetian defense forces, tells Roderigo that Othello has passed him over for promotion. Instead, Othello, a Moor, has chosen the noble and popular Michael Cassio to be his lieutenant. Iago tells Roderigo that he will have his revenge on Othello but behave as a loyal friend while plotting against him. Iago enlists Roderigo to help, and Roderigo agrees because of his infatuation with Desdemona, who has just eloped with Othello. The two men begin by waking Desdemona’s father, Brabantio, with racial and sexual epithets, alerting him that his daughter has run off to marry Othello. An incensed Brabantio raises a mob and confronts Othello in front of the Venetian senate, but Desdemona arrives and testifies to her love for Othello, saving the marriage. The senate, meanwhile, has decided to send Othello to Cyprus to defend it against a Turkish fleet, and the strong-willed and eloquent Desdemona insists on accompanying him.\nThe Turkish fleet is destroyed in a storm, leaving the characters free to celebrate their victory as well as the marriage of Othello and Desdemona. Iago has convinced Roderigo to sell his land and accompany him to Cyprus with money, promising that he will help him seduce Desdemona. Iago then gets Cassio drunk and uses Roderigo to draw him into a fight, prompting Othello to demote him. He convinces a distraught Cassio to ask Desdemona to lobby Othello on his behalf, then poisons Othello against them both by insinuating, then outright accusing Cassio and Desdemona, of having an affair. The success of Iago’s plot hinges on Desdemona’s handkerchief, which she drops accidentally after trying to soothe a distraught Othello. Iago’s wife, Emilia, gives Iago the handkerchief but doesn’t know what he plans to do with it.\nIago plants the handkerchief in Cassio’s room, and Cassio in turn gives it to Bianca, a local woman who prostitutes herself for food and clothing. Bianca is in love with Cassio and suspects the handkerchief came from another woman he is sleeping with. Iago draws Cassio into discussing Bianca, and Othello eavesdrops and believes he is speaking about Desdemona. Bianca then enters and confronts Cassio, and Othello sees the handkerchief, sending him into a jealous fury. Iago further goads him into planning the deaths of both Cassio and Desdemona. Iago enlists Roderigo to carry out Cassio’s murder by convincing him that he will take Cassio’s place as Desdemona’s lover. Roderigo, meanwhile, has begun to suspect that Iago had swindled him out of his money, but agrees to the plot.\nRoderigo attacks Cassio, and both men are wounded but survive. Iago arrives on-scene and murders Roderigo so that he won’t reveal his plot. He blames Bianca for the attack on Cassio. Desdemona, meanwhile, has come to fear Othello and seems to suspect that her life may be in danger. She asks Emilia to put her wedding sheets on the bed and goes to sleep. Othello enters as she sleeps and kisses her. When she awakes, he announces that she must make peace with God because he is going to kill her. She repeatedly protests her innocence and says that Cassio will also deny the affair, but Othello tells her (incorrectly) that Cassio is dead, and she realizes that she can’t convince her husband of her innocence. He strangles her according to Iago’s suggestion, and shortly thereafter Emilia arrives in time to hear Desdemona’s dying statement that she has been unjustly murdered. Even in her last moments, however, Desdemona protects Othello and refuses to name him as her murderer.\nA grief-stricken and enraged Emilia insults Othello’s intelligence and proclaims Desdemona’s innocence. Iago, Cassio, and Venetian envoys Lodovico and Montano enter, and Othello explains his rationale for killing Desdemona. Emilia realizes what Iago has done and refuses to keep quiet, revealing that she was the one who gave Iago the incriminating handkerchief. Iago kills Emilia for speaking the truth and betraying him, and she falls on the bed and dies next to Desdemona. Othello implies that Iago is some sort of devil and wounds him, preferring that he live and be tortured, as Lodovico and Cassio pledge to do. Othello asks the men to remember his previous noble deeds when telling his story back in Venice and kills himself, also falling on the bed. Lodovico charges Cassio with punishing Iago and governing Cyprus and says that he will return to Venice to tell the sad story.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.supersummary.com/othello/", "author": "William Shakespeare", "characters": {"Iago": "Iago is a subordinate of Othello’s and a captain in the Venetian defense forces. Othello passes him over for promotion in favor of the well-spoken, handsome Cassio, although Iago believes he is more experienced. Iago is determined to exact his revenge on Othello for this perceived insult, and also suspects that both Othello and Cassio have had sex with his wife Emilia, even though he has no evidence of this. Iago’s pride, jealousy, and misogyny combine into a destructive malice whose ultimate outcome even Iago can’t entirely predict. Throughout the play, he infects the other characters with his own negative traits, inciting them, and himself, to murder. In addition to driving Othello to kill Desdemona and Roderigo to attempt to kill Cassio, Iago himself kills Roderigo, as well as his wife, Emilia. He has a keen sense of other men’s insecurities and motivations, and in his plots, reduces women to prizes to be won, guarded, and discarded.", "Roderigo": "As one of Desdemona’s rejected suitors, Iago tricks Roderigo into giving Iago most of his money and manipulates him into ruining Cassio’s career before attempting to murder him. When Roderigo begins to suspect Iago is using him, Iago kills him. Roderigo’s lust for Desdemona, and Iago’s promise that he will help gratify it, drives most of his behavior.", "Brabantino": "Brabantino is a Venetian senator and Desdemona’s father. Brabantio is horrified that his daughter has eloped with Othello because of his race, but reluctantly accepts the marriage when Desdemona attests to her love for Othello before the senate. Brabantio’s bigotry and misogyny—he warns Othello that if Desdemona would trick her father she would also trick her husband—echoes Iago’s and provides a framework of Othello’s insecurities for Iago to exploit. Brabantio dies before Desdemona’s murder, allegedly from sorrow over her marriage.", "Desdemona": "Desdemona is a Venetian woman who falls in love with the much-older Othello by listening to tales of his life at her father’s dinner table. Desdemona is good-natured and clever, and her elopement with Othello after passing up many Venetian suitors demonstrates that she has a strong will. Othello states that he loves Desdemona for her mind. Later, Othello murderers her in a misconstrued jealous rage, and she remains loyal to him, even in death.", "Cassio": "As Othello’s new lieutenant, Cassio is well-spoken, attractive, and an object of envy to Iago. Though usually well-mannered, Cassio is prone to short-temperedness, a quality Iago exploits so that he, in a drunken scuffle with Roderigo, loses his position. Cassio is respectful towards Desdemona, but ridicules Bianca, the prostitute who is in love with him. By planting evidence, lying, and staging a misleading conversation with Cassio, Iago convinces Othello that Cassio is Desdemona’s lover. Cassio survives Iago’s plot to kill him, and at the end of the play, he takes Othello’s place as governor of Cyprus.", "Emilia": "Emilia is Iago’s wife and an attendant and confidante to Desdemona. Emilia unwittingly helps Iago frame Cassio by giving him Desdemona’s dropped handkerchief, which Iago plants in Cassio’s bedroom. When she learns that Othello suspects Desdemona of cheating on him, Emilia acts as Desdemona’s advocate, insisting on her innocence. She holds a grimmer view of marriage than Desdemona and explains Othello’s sudden viciousness towards her as part of the natural course of husbands revealing their true selves only after the wedding. She confronts Othello after he murders Desdemona, heedless of his drawn sword. She similarly defies her husband, refuses to be silent or to go home, and exposes his plot, even after he also draws his sword on her. Iago kills her as a result of her allegiance to Desdemona and her insistence on the truth over obedience to her husband.", "Montano": "Montano is the governor of Cyprus before Othello’s arrival. Cassio wounds him after he tries to break up the fight between him and Roderigo, resulting in Cassio’s demotion.", "Bianca": "Bianca is a Cyprus woman who prostitutes herself for food and clothing. She falls in love with Cassio, who is one of her customers. After Roderigo wounds Cassio, Iago attempts to blame Bianca, a woman of low social status, for ordering Cassio’s murder.", "Lodovico": "Lodovico is a Venetian and a relative of Brabantio and Desdemona. When Lodovico arrives with a letter from Venice ordering Othello’s return and Cassio’s promotion to governor of Venice, Othello is enraged and strikes Desdemona, shocking Lodovico. At the end of the play, Lodovico questions Othello and Cassio, which pieces together Iago’s entire plot for the characters that remain.", "Gratiano": "Another Venetian and relative of Brabantio and Desdemona, Gratiano arrives in Cyprus with Lodovico. He guards Othello after he murders Desdemona, and he inherits Othello’s property after he commits suicide."}, "chapter_summaries": {"Act I, Scene 1 Summary": "Iago complains to Roderigo that his commander Othello, a Moor, has promoted Cassio to be his lieutenant instead of the more battle-hardened Iago. When Roderigo suggests he quit his post, Iago tells him he instead plans to pretend to serve Othello while acting in his own self-interest. To that end, he suggests that he and Roderigo alert Desdemona’s father, Brabantio, that she has eloped with Othello. Roderigo, a rejected suitor of Desdemona, agrees, and the two wake Brabantio and incite him with lewd, racist references to miscegenation: “Even now, now, very now, an old black ram/Is tupping your white ewe” (97-98). When Brabantio discovers that Desdemona is missing, he raises an armed mob and asks Roderigo to lead him to Othello. Iago, not wanting to be seen working against Othello, exits before Brabantio can recognize him.", "Act I, Scene 2 Summary": "At Othello’s residence, Iago, pretending to be allied with Othello, warns him of Brabantio’s anger and impending arrival. Othello expresses confidence that his past service to the Venetian government, noble status, and legal marriage to Desdemona will protect him. Cassio enters and informs Othello that the senate has summoned him for an urgent matter of state. As Othello prepares to go with Cassio, Brabantio, Roderigo, and their mob enter. Brabantio accuses him of using magic to control Desdemona and declares his intent to imprison Othello. Othello replies that the Duke has summoned him on important business, and Brabantio, also a senator, discovers that he too has been summoned. He goes with Othello to settle the matter before the senate.", "Act I, Scene 3 Summary": "In the senate, the senators are discussing the Turks’ impending siege on Cyprus. Othello and Brabantio enter, and Brabantio again accuses Othello of controlling his daughter with magic or drugs because she is “not deficient, blind, or/lame of sense” (76) enough to marry him otherwise. Othello tells the senate that Desdemona fell in love with him while listening to his tales of his adventures at her father’s dinner table. Iago brings Desdemona before the senate and she attests to her love for Othello. The senate intends to send him to defend Cyprus, and Desdemona asks to accompany him, which the senate agree to. Having failed to ruin the marriage of Othello and Desdemona, Roderigo contemplates killing himself. Iago brushes aside Roderigo’s despair and says he should instead acquire money and join him in seeking revenge on Othello. Roderigo vows to sell his land, and after he exits, Iago reveals that he will use Roderigo’s money to fund his own revenge plan. He also reveals that there is a rumor that Othello has slept with his wife, Emilia, and the possibility alone is enough to motivate him to ruin Othello. He then describes his plan to frame Cassio as Desdemona’s lover.", "Act I Analysis": "The first act establishes the Venetians’ view of Othello. They regard him as a noble servant of the state and a skilled warrior, but do not regard him as an equal because he is a “Moor” (likely meaning North African). The senators and Duke of Venice view Othello’s good traits as qualities that bely his race. This ingrained bigotry allows Roderigo and Iago to goad Desdemona’s father into a fury over her elopement with Othello. However, the Turks’ impending attack on Cyprus reinforces Othello’s military importance to Venice and probably helps convince the Senate to let the marriage stand. Although he initially seems allied with Roderigo, Iago’s soliloquies let the reader see that he is using Roderigo for his own ends. Since Iago has no true allegiance to any other character, soliloquies will be an important window to his intentions throughout the play. The dramatic irony that results from Iago’s revelations heighten the tension for readers and audiences and also gives them an opportunity to appreciate the complexity of Iago’s manipulations.", "Act II, Scene 1 Summary": "A storm destroys the Turkish fleet, and Cassio, Roderigo, Iago, Emilia, and Desdemona land in Cyprus, victorious, but concerned that Othello’s ship has not yet arrived. Cassio kisses Iago’s wife, Emilia, upon meeting her. Iago makes insulting jokes about Emilia’s chiding nature then goes on to make sexist generalizations about women: “Come on, come on! You are pictures out of door,/bells in your parlors, wildcats in your kitchens,/saints in your injuries, devils being offended, players/in your huswifery, and huswives in your beds” (122-25). Desdemona goads Iago into further wordplay that becomes increasingly insulting towards women, at one point saying that the destiny of a beautiful, eloquent, modest, wise, and restrained woman is to nurse babies and pinch pennies.Othello enters and reunites with Desdemona. After the two exits, Iago tells Roderigo that Desdemona is in love with Cassio, saying that Othello is too old and ugly to hold her sexual interest. He predicts that Desdemona and Cassio will become lovers unless Roderigo gets Cassio out of the way by drawing him into a fight, which will compel Othello to fire him. When he’s alone, Iago states that he thinks Cassio and Desdemona could really love each other, that he hates Othello but admits he is a good and loving man and husband, and that he himself loves Desdemona in a vengeful parallel to Othello’s rumored infidelity with his own wife. He says that he wants to get even with Othello “wife for wife” (321), or at least drive Othello insane with jealousy over Cassio, who Iago also suspects of sleeping with his wife. Iago further admits that he doesn’t have a concrete idea of how his plan will end.", "Act II, Scene 2 Summary": "A herald announces that Othello has ordered a combined victory-and-wedding-celebration to be held on Cyprus.", "Act II, Scene 3 Summary": "Cassio, Iago, and the other guards celebrate the victory of the Turks while Othello and Desdemona retire to consummate their marriage. Iago goads Cassio into drinking too much. When he leaves, Iago implies to Montano, a Cyprus official, that Cassio is an alcoholic and as such, unreliable. Meanwhile, Roderigo goads Cassio into a fight, and Montano attempts to restrain Cassio, who then wounds him. Roderigo sounds the alarm which summons Othello, who demands to know the cause of the fight. Iago pretends that he doesn’t want to tattle-tale on anyone and waits until Montano implicates Cassio. Othello and Montano press him, and he repeats what he saw but defends Cassio to Othello. Othello strips Cassio of his position, and Cassio is grief-stricken over the loss of his good reputation. Iago convinces him to ask Desdemona to intervene on his behalf. A dispirited Roderigo tells Iago his money is almost gone and that he will return to Venice, but Iago convinces him to be patient. When Roderigo leaves, Iago states that he will ask his wife, Emilia, to convince Desdemona to help Cassio, which will make it appear that she has feelings for him.", "Act II Analysis": "The sudden removal of the Turks as a plot point implicitly diminishes some of Othello’s social capital. Without an enemy to fight, Iago is free to reduce Othello’s identity to his (according to Iago, inferior) race and advanced age. Iago’s motives also become more amorphous: he admires Othello but hates him, and Iago suspects both Othello and Cassio of having sex with his wife, a suspicion he never elaborates on. By saying that the suspicion is enough reason for him to act, Iago reveals that he isn’t rational—his plots arise from his own shifting insecurities. To that end, he begins by ensuring that Cassio loses his position and Othello’s esteem, and stokes Roderigo’s lust for Desdemona by making him as jealous of Cassio as Iago is. His view of his wife as a sexually receptive object also sets the pattern for how he explains Desdemona to Roderigo: Othello couldn’t possibly hold her sexual interest, and Cassio is a convenient and appealing alternative. He frames her imaginary interest in Cassio not as something borne out of choice, but out of proximity and indiscriminate, animal passion.", "Act III, Scene 1 Summary": "Emilia assures Cassio that Desdemona is speaking to Othello on his behalf, but Cassio is impatient and asks that he be allowed to make his case to Desdemona directly. Emilia agrees to arrange a meeting between the two of them.", "Act III, Scene 2 Summary": "Othello gives Iago letters for the ship captain to deliver to the Senate of Venice and asks him to rejoin him once his task is done.", "Act III, Scene 3 Summary": "Cassio makes his case to Emilia and Desdemona, who vows to convince Othello to reinstate him. Cassio leaves when Iago and Othello enter, and Iago remarks that he doesn’t like to see Cassio “steal away so guiltylike,/Seeing your coming” (42-43). Desdemona presses Othello to reinstate Cassio, and he agrees for her sake. Desdemona says that he has not truly done her a favor, because reinstating Cassio is for Othello’s own good. When she leaves, Iago manipulates Othello into suspecting Cassio by pretending to be reluctant to air his own suspicions of Desdemona’s infidelity. Othello tries to cast away doubt, saying there is no point in jealousy without proof, and once proof is obtained there is also no point in jealousy, since there is no longer reason to love. Iago agrees and recommends Othello neither trust nor suspect but begin to observe Desdemona closely. The more Iago protests that his own suspicions are probably baseless, the more Othello believes them. He muses to himself that Iago is extremely honest and an excellent judge of character. Iago exits, and Othello begins to curse marriage, saying that men can lay claim to women but not their appetites.  Desdemona and Emilia enter. Desdemona notices Othello looks unwell and tries to mop his head with her handkerchief, which he rejects. The handkerchief falls to the floor. After the two exits, Emilia picks it up and remarks that it was the first gift Othello gave to Desdemona and that Iago had been asking her to steal it. She presents it to Iago, who will not tell her why he wants it, and he remarks that Desdemona will be upset to lose it. When she exits, Iago delivers a short soliloquy explaining that he will plant the handkerchief in Cassio's room to cast suspicion on him because: “Trifles light as air/Are to the jealous confirmations strong/As proofs of holy writ (370-72). Othello enters, tortured by the idea of Desdemona’s infidelity and angry with Iago for planting the idea in his head in the absence of proof. When Othello threatens him, Iago pretends he’s offended, gives his verbal resignation, and berates himself for being honest. Othello immediately repents and tells Iago that he should always be honest, yet Othello presses him for more evidence. Iago claims that he once slept next to Cassio, and that in his sleep Cassio called him Desdemona and kissed him. This prompts Othello, who before had only spoken of banishing Desdemona, to say, “I’ll tear her to pieces!” (490). Iago then tells Othello that he saw Cassio wipe his beard with Desdemona’s handkerchief. Othello, enraged, charges Iago with ensuring Cassio’s death within three days. Iago agrees but tells Othello to let Desdemona live, which prompts Othello to vow that he will kill her. He then promotes Iago to lieutenant.", "Act III, Scene 4 Summary": "Desdemona has a short comic dialogue with the Clown who serves her and Othello. She asks the Clown to tell Cassio that she on his behalf has worked. When the Clown leaves, Desdemona laments the loss of her handkerchief and tells Emilia she is fortunate that Othello does not have a jealous nature. Emilia pretends not to know what happened to the handkerchief.Othello enters and come up with an excuse to ask to borrow the handkerchief he gave Desdemona and tells her it is a curse to lose it—specifically that the owner’s husband would hate her if she lost it or gave it away. He insists she bring it to him, and she thinks he is trying to trick and distract her into dropping the subject of Cassio’s reinstatement. She continues to press his suit, interspersed with Othello’s angry demands for the handkerchief. Othello exits and Emilia remarks that he seems jealous, and that men only show their true selves after a year or two, after they have had their fill of their wives.Iago and Cassio enter, and Iago urges Cassio to keep pressing Desdemona for help. Desdemona explains that she has done all she can and is paying for it with Othello’s displeasure, such that she has never seen before. Iago remarks that he has never seen Othello angry and volunteers to speak with him. When he leaves, both women say that they hope it is a matter of state that makes Othello so angry, and Emilia remarks that jealousy needs no cause and feeds upon itself. They exit, and Bianca, who Cassio is having an affair with, enters to say that she misses him and has been looking for him. He giver her Desdemona’s handkerchief, and when she becomes suspicious that he got it from another woman, he says that he just found it in his chamber.", "Act III Analysis": "This act shows the fulmination of Iago’s plot. In Scene 3, he transforms Othello from a trusting husband into a murderous one. Iago is able to do this because Othello trusts him more than Desdemona, and Iago successfully enacts an “us versus them” gender binary, pitting women against men. Iago hearkens to Brabantio’s own logic in this vein—that Desdemona’s trickery of him, her father, was not a specific plot for a specific end but a pattern that applies to the world of men. Iago reminds Othello: “She did deceive her father, marrying you,/And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks,/ She loved them most” (3.3 238-40). Iago coaxes Othello into placing his masculine identity (and its attendant values and behavioral demands) before his individual judgement, beliefs, and feelings. Emilia and Desdemona are startled by Othello’s frightening transformation, which is all the more frightening because, as Emilia points out, jealousy feeds upon itself without cause. Desdemona does not realize that Iago has made her a stereotype in Othello’s eyes, blinding him to her human qualities.", "Act IV, Scene 1 Summary": "Iago is trying (and intending the opposite) to convince Othello that Cassio’s possession of Desdemona’s handkerchief isn’t necessarily proof that the two had sex, saying that perhaps they only kissed or lay naked in bed, “not meaning any harm” (6). Iago said he heard Cassio bragging about being in bed with Desdemona and supplies an image by saying, “With her—on her—what you will” (44). This throws Othello into a fit of rage and he says he will kill Cassio first and then force him to confess. Othello, overcome, falls into a fit, and Iago, in an aside, congratulates himself on how well his plan is working. Cassio enters to find Othello in the throes of epilepsy, but Iago sends him away.Continuing his reverse psychology campaign, Iago tells Othello that lots of men are married to unfaithful women and that he’s lucky to at least know the truth about Desdemona. Needing more proof to convince Othello, Iago tells him to hide while he tricks Cassio into talking about his exploits with Desdemona. When Cassio reenters, Iago asks him about Bianca, a prostitute who sells herself for food and clothing, and who has fallen in love with Cassio. Othello witnesses Cassio laughing and talking derisively about Bianca and thinks he is speaking of Desdemona. Bianca enters and confronts Cassio for giving her a handkerchief belonging to some other “minx” (174). Othello sees it, and Cassio goes after Bianca to keep her from making a scene in the streets.Iago asks Othello to remember how Cassio laughed about his use of Desdemona, and Othello at first is outraged at the insult to her. Iago urges him to remember that she is not a good woman, and Othello swings between praising her fine qualities, including her wit, and damning her. Seeing that Othello is having trouble staying angry at Desdemona, Iago then works on Othello’s masculine pride by suggesting that, since Othello isn’t bothered by her cheating, he could just let her do it. This succeeds in enraging Othello who says he will chop her to pieces, then asks Iago to acquire poison so that he can kill her that same night. Iago says, “Do it not with poison. Strangle her in her bed,/even the bed she hath contaminated” (228-29). Iago says that he in turn, will kill Cassio.Iago and Desdemona enter with Lodovico, a relative of Desdemona’s from Venice with a message for Othello from the Duke and Senators. Lodovico asks after Cassio, and Othello becomes angry when Desdemona explains his falling-out with Othello. The message instructs Othello to return to Venice and leave Cassio in charge in Cyprus. Desdemona says she is glad, and, believing that she means for Cassio’s promotion and not her return to Venice, Othello strikes her. Lodovico is shocked at Othello’s uncharacteristic behavior and tells him to make amends with the crying Desdemona. Instead he insults and torments her before ordering her finally to leave.After Othello leaves, Lodovico ask Iago if he is losing his mind, and Iago implies that he is and will likely continue to threaten Desdemona. Lodovico wonders if it’s the letter that has upset Othello, but Iago reiterates that he should only observe Othello’s actions for himself. Lodovico says he is sorry to have so misjudged Othello’s character.", "Act IV, Scene 2 Summary": "Othello grills Emilia on the relationship between Cassio and Desdemona, and Emilia swears there is nothing going on between the two and that Desdemona is a good woman and faithful wife. Othello doesn’t believe her and sends for Desdemona, then orders Emilia to leave. Desdemona can tell Othello is furious and begs him to explain why. When he accuses her, she swears she is faithful, and Othello tells her she is only damning herself by lying. He begins to weep and observes that he could have handled any hardship except being rejected by his wife and being made a laughingstock. He continues to accuse Desdemona of being a “whore” (99), and she continues to swear she isn’t. He doesn’t believe her protests and when Emilia reenters, leaves the room.A shocked Desdemona asks Emilia to put her wedding sheets on the bed and send for Iago. Desdemona and Emilia recount Othello’s accusations and vicious verbal abuse, with Emilia lamenting Desdemona’s ill treatment after giving up so much for Othello’s sake: “Hath she forsook so many noble matches,/Her father and her country and her friends,/To be called “whore”? Would it not make one/weep?” (146-49). Iago reassures Desdemona and pretends to be outraged on her behalf. Emilia, meanwhile, concludes (correctly) that some malicious person must have planted the idea in Othello’s head. Iago rejects the idea, tells Emilia she is a fool, and tells Desdemona that it is only the affairs of state that have put Othello in a bad mood.After Desdemona and Emilia exit, Roderigo enters, angry with Iago for having tricked him out of his money. He reveals that he had given Iago jewels to pass to Desdemona in the hopes of winning some “sudden respect and acquaintance” (221)—likely meaning sexual favor—but it didn’t work. He threatens to ask Desdemona to return the jewels, and if she doesn’t have them, he will instead challenge the deceiving Iago to a duel. Iago pretends to have a newfound respect for Roderigo but insists he has been honest with him. He then lies and tells Roderigo that Othello is bound for Mauritania with Desdemona, and that if Roderigo kills Cassio, Desdemona will have to stay in Cyprus, and Roderigo will get to sleep with her. Roderigo is interested, and Iago promises to give him even more reasons to kill Cassio.", "Act IV, Scene 3 Summary": "Othello is talking with Lodovico and tells Desdemona to go to prepare for bed and to send Emilia away. Desdemona asks Emilia to use her wedding sheets as her death shroud, then tells her of her mother’s maid, Barbary, who was abandoned by her lover and used to sing a song called “Willow.” She sings the song while Emilia helps her dress for bed, and the lyrics include the lines: “Let nobody blame him, his scorn I approve” (56). Desdemona asks Emilia if she would ever cheat on her husband “for all the world” and Emilia jokes: “The world’s a huge thing. It is a great price/for a small vice” (77-79). Desdemona says she wouldn’t, and Emilia says that in any case, if a wife cheats on her husband, it’s likely his fault for cheating on her first or for beating or controlling her. She says that infidelity is a revenge that shows men that their wives are just as much human beings as they are: “They see, and/smell,/And have their palates both for sweet and sour,/As husbands have” (105-08). She concludes that husbands must treat their wives well, or else find that their wives will take on their own bad habits, and leaves Desdemona alone in the bedroom.", "Act IV Analysis": "Iago continues to stoke Othello’s rage by forcing him to picture Cassio and Desdemona together. Othello begins to lose his resolve when he thinks about the human qualities that he loves about Desdemona. To overcome this, Iago must threaten Othello’s masculine pride by suggesting he do nothing and let Desdemona cuckold him. It’s the idea of being made ridiculous in the eyes of other men that incites Othello to say, “I will chop her into messes! Cuckold me?” (4.1. 219). He is externalizing his sense of right and wrong, letting Iago and the imagined judgement of other men dictate his feelings and plans. In the midst of Iago’s insistent objectification of women, particularly to Othello and Roderigo, Emilia, in Scene 3, expresses that she is more than a passive sexual object and that a woman’s infidelity is a reclamation of her humanity. She says that it should show their husbands that they perceive and feel, have their own tastes, and the power to show weakness and exercise choice, just as men do. This act shows that Iago’s and Emilia’s views of a woman’s sexual expression are in opposition. In Iago’s construction, it is the men having sex with the straying wife who gain power over her husband; in Emilia’s, it is the straying wife who is demanding equal status to her own morally-lapsed husband.", "Act V, Scene 1 Summary": "With Iago’s urging, Roderigo ambushes Cassio. In a short soliloquy, Iago reveals that both men dying is an ideal outcome for him because if Roderigo lives, he will demand Iago return the jewels, and if Cassio lives, he may find out about Iago’s lies to Othello. Iago is furthermore jealous of Cassio’s beauty and grace. In the fight, Cassio wounds Roderigo, but Iago then stabs Cassio in the leg from behind and flees. Cassio calls for help and Othello enters, pleased that Iago has made good on his pledge to murder Cassio. He says that Iago is a model for how he himself should act, and Othello declares his intention to murder Desdemona.Lodovico and Gratiano, another Venetian statesman, hear Cassio’s and Roderigo’s cries. They go to investigate along with Iago, and when Cassio implicates Roderigo, Iago stabs and kills him, then continues to wonder who the murderers are. Iago offers to bind Cassio’s wound with his shirt, and when Bianca enters, Iago calls her “trash” (99) and announces that he suspects she is behind the attack. Emilia insults her, and Bianca replies, “I am no strumpet, but of life as honest/As you that thus abuse me” (143-44). In an aside, Iago comments that the events of the night are going to make or break him", "Act V, Scene 2 Summary": "Othello enters the bedroom with a light and watches the sleeping Desdemona. In a soliloquy, Othello resolves not to mar Desdemona’s beauty when he kills her, and laments that it is almost persuading him not to. He asserts that he must kill her to prevent her from betraying more men and kisses her, then likens himself to heaven/God, because he “strikes where it doth love” (24). Desdemona wakes, and Othello tells her she should pray for forgiveness for any crime since he plans to kill her. She maintains that she is guilty of nothing, but says she still feels his murderous look. When he again tells her to address her sins, she says, “They are loves I bear to you” (49). Othello then for the first time accuses her of cheating on him with Cassio and says he saw Cassio with her handkerchief. She asks Othello to summon Cassio since he will say it isn’t true and Othello, referring to Cassio and Iago’s conversation about Bianca, says he has already admitted to having sex with her. Desdemona insists he will not say so, and Othello agrees, saying (incorrectly) that Cassio is dead. Desdemona realizes she is trapped and begs that Othello banish her instead of killing her. While she protests, tries to leave the bed, and asks to say one last prayer, Othello says it’s too late and smothers her. Emilia begins to call for Othello from offstage. Othello thinks there is still some sign of life from Desdemona and attacks her again, until he’s certain she’s dead.Othello draws the curtain around the bed and lets Emilia in. She tells him that Cassio is alive and has killed Roderigo. It turns out that Desdemona is not yet dead, and she cries out that she has been “falsely murdered” (144). Emilia urges her to speak again, and Desdemona proclaims her innocence. When Emilia asks her to name her killer, Desdemona protects Othello by saying, “Nobody. I myself. Farewell,” before dying (152). Othello quickly confesses to a horrified Emilia, who insists on Desdemona’s innocence and calls Othello “a devil” (163). Othello reveals that Iago, Emilia’s own husband, told him of Desdemona’s affair, and Emilia repeatedly asks, “My husband?” as Othello explains Iago’s role in the plot (171, 178, 182). Emilia realizes what her husband has done, proclaims that he is lying and she hopes he rots in hell, and that Desdemona was too fond of Othello, “her most filthy bargain” (192), to ever cheat on him. Othello draws his sword and Emilia says his sword can’t hurt her any more than she has already been hurt. She calls him stupid and says she will tell everyone he is a murderer, then she begins calling for help.Iago, Gratiano, and Montano enter, and Emilia, still not believing that Iago could be so evil, urges him to deny that he told Othello that Desdemona was unfaithful. He at first hedges, saying, “I told him what I thought, and told no more/Than what he found himself was apt and true” (212-13), but when she presses him, he admits that he said Desdemona and Cassio were having an affair. He tells Emilia to stop talking, and she refuses, saying that Othello has murdered Desdemona because of Iago’s lies. She says that she suspected Iago’s villainy, and he orders her to go home. She refuses and says she may never go home again. When Othello explains to Gratiano and Montano that the handkerchief was proof, Emilia exclaims and again insists to Iago that no man will stop her from speaking the truth. He again tells her to go home and draws his sword, shocking Gratiano. Emilia continues to explain how she found the handkerchief and gave it to Iago, who had begged her to steal it. Realizing what Iago has done, Othello rushes at him, but Iago kills Emilia first and flees.Montano exits to purse Iago, leaving Gratiano to guard a disarmed Othello. Emilia sings “Willow” as she dies next to Desdemona. Othello tells Gratiano he has another sword in the bedroom, but will not use it on him, saying it is only the end of his own life. Cassio, Lodovico, and Montano enter with Iago as prisoner. Othello wounds Iago, saying he would rather have him live since death is a happiness, and asks Cassio to forgive him. Othello wants to know why Iago tortured him, but Iago replies that he will not speak, though Gratiano vows to torture him until he does. With letters from Roderigo’s pocket, Roderigo’s surprise deathbed confession, and Cassio’s explanations, the remaining characters work out Iago’s entire plot. Lodovico says that Othello will be stripped of his command and Iago tortured and brought to justice in Venice. Othello urges them not to exaggerate his tale, but to describe him as someone who loved too much and was manipulated into a frenzy. He likens Desdemona to a precious “pearl” (407) that he threw away without understanding her value, and he asks the men to remember his other valiant deeds in service of the state of Venice. He then stabs himself and kisses Desdemona as he dies. Lodovico blames Iago for the three dead people on the bed. He tells Cassio that he will govern Cyprus and decide how to punish Iago while he, Lodovico, will return to Venice and relate what has happened.", "Act V Analysis": "When Iago tries to blame Bianca for Roderigo’s attack on Cassio, her status as a lower-class woman seems to condemn her in the eyes of the other men, and in the eyes of Emilia, who expresses disgust for her and calls her a “strumpet” (5.1 142). Emilia is willing to believe that Bianca is guilty of murder because of what she perceives as her sexual liberality, or immorality. When Bianca counters that she is as “honest” (5.1 143) as Emilia, she is likely referring to her own love for Cassio, and her refusal to let her economic circumstances and the insults of Iago and the other men damage her self-regard. In the next scene, Emilia herself also refuses to be defined or controlled by her husband, Iago, or by Othello. After Othello murders Desdemona, she verbally attacks Othello, even though he threatens her with his sword. In doing so, she insists that her observations, knowledge, and feelings have not only equal weight, but more than Othello’s because they are not polluted with jealous paranoia. When Iago also threatens her with a sword, he is trying to subdue and subordinate her, forcing her to behave in line with his own interests. Instead, Emilia insists on being a separate human being and allies herself with the dead Desdemona, prompting Iago to kill her. Before committing suicide, Othello admits that he was manipulated into madness and threw away Desdemona as if she were a “pearl” (5.2 407) whose value he did not recognize. This line reveals that Othello still thinks of Desdemona as an object whose meaning he did not decipher, not as an individual whose actions and speech he ignored."}}, "num_tokens": 58878}

In the past, the only answer to the problem has been to grapple with the difficulties with the aid of explanatory footnotes (often missing when they are most needed) and a stern teacher. Generations of students have complained that “Shakespeare was ruined for me at school.”\n\nUsually a fuller appreciation of Shakespeare’s plays comes in later life, when the mind has matured and language skills are more developed. Often the desire to read Shakespeare for pleasure and enrichment follows from a visit to the theater, where excellence of acting and production can bring to life qualities which sometimes lie dormant on the printed page.\n\nShakespeare Made Easy can never be a substitute for the original plays. It cannot possibly convey the full meaning of Shakespeare’s poetic expression, which is untranslatable. Shakespeare Made Easy concentrates on the dramatic aspect, enabling the novice to become familiar with the plot and characters, and to experience one facet of Shakespeare’s genius. To know and understand the central issues of each play is a sound starting point for further exploration and development.\n\nDiscretion can be used in choosing the best method to employ. One way is to read the original Shakespeare first, ignoring the modern translation or using it only when interest or understanding flags. Another way is to read the translation first, to establish confidence and familiarity with plots and characters.\n\nEither way, cross-reference can be illuminating. The modern text can explain “what is being said” if Shakespeare’s language is particularly complex or his expression antiquated. The Shakespeare text will show the reader of the modern paraphrase how much more can be expressed in poetry than in prose.\n\nThe use of Shakespeare Made Easy means that the newcomer need never be overcome by textual difficulties. From first to last, a measure of understanding is at hand – the key is provided for what has been a locked door to many students in the past. And as understanding grows, so an awareness develops of the potential of language as a vehicle for philosophic and moral expression, beauty, and the abidingly memorable.\n\nEven professional Shakespearean scholars can never hope to arrive at a complete understanding of the plays. Each critic, researcher, actor or producer merely adds a little to the work that has already been done, or makes fresh interpretations of the texts for new generations. For everyone, Shakespearean appreciation is a journey. Shakespeare Made Easy is intended to help with the first steps.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare\n\nHis life\n\nWilliam Shakespeare was born in Stratford-on-Avon, Warwickshire, on April 23, 1564, the son of a prosperous wool and leather merchant. Very little is known of his early life. From parish records we know that he married Ann Hathaway in 1582, when he was eighteen, and she was twenty-six. They had three children, the eldest of whom died in childhood.\n\nBetween his marriage and the next thing we know about him, there is a gap of ten years. Probably he became a member of a traveling company of actors. By 1592 he had settled in London and had earned a reputation as an actor and playwright.\n\nTheaters were then in their infancy. The first (called The Theatre ) was built by the actor James Burbage in 1576, in Shoreditch, then a suburb of London. Two more followed as the taste for theater grew: The Curtain in 1577 and The Rose in 1587. The demand for new plays naturally increased. Shakespeare probably earned a living adapting old plays and working in collaboration with others on new ones. Today we would call him a “freelance,” since he was not permanently attached to one theater.\n\nIn 1594, a new company of actors, The Lord Chamberlain’s Men, was formed, and Shakespeare was one of the shareholders. He remained a member throughout his working life. The Company was regrouped in 1603 and renamed The King’s Men, with James I as their patron.\n\nShakespeare and his fellow actors prospered. In 1598 they built their own theater, The Globe , which broke away from the traditional rectangular shape of the inn and its yard (the early home of traveling bands of actors). Shakespeare described it in Henry V as “this wooden O,” because it was circular.\n\nMany other theaters were built by investors eager to profit from the new enthusiasm for drama. The Hope , The Fortune , The Red Bull , and The Swan were all open-air “public” theaters. There were also many “private” (or indoor) theaters, one of which ( The Blackfriars ) was purchased by Shakespeare and his friends because the child actors who performed there were dangerous competitors. (Shakespeare denounces them in Hamlet. )\n\nAfter writing some thirty-seven plays (the exact number is something which scholars argue about), Shakespeare retired to his native Stratford, wealthy and respected. He died on his birthday, in 1616.\n\nHis plays\n\nShakespeare’s plays were not all published in his lifetime. None of them comes to us exactly as he wrote it.\n\nIn Elizabethan times, plays were not regarded as either literature or good reading matter. They were written at speed (often by more than one writer), performed perhaps ten or twelve times, and then discarded. Fourteen of Shakespeare’s plays were first printed in Quarto (17cm × 21cm) volumes, not all with his name as the author. Some were authorized (the “good” Quartos) and probably were printed from prompt copies provided by the theater. Others were pirated (the “bad” Quartos) by booksellers who may have employed shorthand writers, or bought actors’ copies after the run of the play had ended.\n\nIn 1623, seven years after Shakespeare’s death, John Hemming and Henry Condell (fellow actors and shareholders in The King’s Men) published a collected edition of Shakespeare’s works – thirty-six plays in all – in a Folio (21cm × 34cm) edition. From their introduction it would seem that they used Shakespeare’s original manuscripts (“we have scarce received from him a blot in his papers”), but the Folio volumes that still survive are not all exactly alike, nor are the plays printed as we know them today, with act and scene divisions and stage directions.\n\nA modern edition of a Shakespeare play is the result of a great deal of scholarly research and editorial skill over several centuries. The aim is always to publish a text (based on the good and bad Quartos and the Folio editions) that most closely resembles what Shakespeare intended. Misprints have added to the problems, so some words and lines are pure guesswork. This explains why some versions of Shakespeare’s plays differ from others.\n\n\n![Image](Images/pg10.jpg)\n\n\nInterior of the Swan Theatre – from a pen and ink drawing made in 1596 (Mansell Collection)\n\nHis theater\n\nThe first playhouse built as such in Elizabethan London, constructed in 1576, was The Theatre. Its co-founders were John Brayne, an investor, and James Burbage, a carpenter turned actor. Like the six or seven “public” (or outdoor) theaters which followed it over the next thirty years, it was situated outside the city, to avoid conflict with the authorities. They disapproved of players and playgoing, partly on moral and political grounds, and partly because of the danger of spreading the plague. (There were two major epidemics during Shakespeare’s lifetime, and on each occasion the theaters were closed for lengthy periods.)\n\nThe Theatre was a financial success, and Shakespeare’s company performed there until 1598, when a dispute over the lease of the land forced Burbage to take down the building. It was recreated in Southwark, as The Globe , with Shakespeare and several of his fellow actors as the principal shareholders.\n\nBy modern standards, The Globe was small. Externally, the octagonal building measured fewer than thirty meters across, but in spite of this it could accommodate an audience of between two and three thousand people. (The largest of the three theaters at the National Theatre complex in London today seats 1160.)\n\nPerformances were advertised by means of playbills posted around the city, and they took place during the hours of daylight when the weather was suitable. A flag flew to show that all was well, to save playgoers a wasted journey.\n\nAt the entrance, a doorkeeper collected one penny (about 60 cents today) for admission to the “pit” – a name taken from the old inn-yards, where bear-baiting and cock-fighting were popular sports. This was the minimum charge for seeing a play. The “groundlings,” as they were called, simply stood around the three sides of the stage, in the open air. Those who were better off could pay extra for a seat under cover. Stairs led from the pit to three tiers of galleries round the walls. The higher one went, the more one paid. The best seats cost one shilling ($7 today). In theaters owned by speculators like Francis Langley and Philip Henslowe, half the gallery takings went to the landlord.\n\nA full house might consist of 800 groundlings and 1500 in the galleries, with a dozen more exclusive seats on the stage itself for the gentry. A new play might run for between six and sixteen performances; the average was about ten. As there were no breaks between scenes, and no intervals, most plays could be performed in two hours. A trumpet sounded three times before the play began.\n\nThe acting company assembled in the Tiring House at the rear of the stage. This was where they “attired” (or dressed) themselves: not in costumes representing the period of the play, but in Elizabethan doublet and hose. All performances were therefore in modern dress, though no expense was spared to make the stage costumes lavish. The entire company was male. By law, actresses were not allowed, and female roles were performed by boys.\n\nAccess to the stage from the Tiring House was through two doors, one on each side of the stage. Because there was no front curtain, every entrance had to have its corresponding exit, so an actor killed on stage had to be carried off. There was no scenery: the audience used its imagination, guided by the spoken word. Storms and night scenes might well be performed on sunny days in midafternoon; the Elizabethan playgoer relied entirely on the playwright’s descriptive skills to establish the dramatic atmosphere.\n\nOnce on stage, the actors and their expensive clothes were protected from sudden showers by a canopy, the underside of which was painted blue and spangled with stars to represent the heavens. A trapdoor in the stage made ghostly entrances and the gravedigging scene in Hamlet possible. Behind the main stage, in between the two entrance doors, there was a curtained area, concealing a small inner stage, useful for bedroom scenes. Above this was a balcony, which served for castle walls (as in Henry V ) or a domestic balcony (as in the famous scene in Romeo and Juliet ).\n\nThe acting style in Elizabethan times was probably more declamatory than we favor today, but the close proximity of the audience also made a degree of intimacy possible. In those days soliloquies and asides seemed quite natural. Act and scene divisions did not exist (those in printed versions of the play today have been added by editors), but Shakespeare often indicates a scene-ending by a rhyming couplet.\n\nA company such as The King’s Men at The Globe would consist of around twenty-five actors, half of whom might be shareholders, and the rest part-timers engaged for a particular play. Among the shareholders in The Globe were several specialists – William Kempe, for example, was a renowned comedian and Robert Armin was a singer and dancer. Playwrights wrote parts to suit the actors who were available, and devised ways of overcoming the absence of women. Shakespeare often has his heroines dress as young men, and physical contact between lovers was formal compared with the realism we expect today.\n\nHis verse\n\nShakespeare wrote his plays mostly in blank verse: that is, unrhymed lines consisting of ten syllables, alternately stressed and unstressed. The technical term for this form is the iambic pentameter. When Shakespeare first began to write for the stage, it was fashionable to maintain this regular beat from the first line of the play till the last.\n\nShakespeare conformed at first, and then experimented. Some of his early plays contain whole scenes in rhyming couplets – in Romeo and Juliet, for example, there is extensive use of rhyme, and as if to show his versatility, Shakespeare even inserts a sonnet into the dialogue.\n\nBut as he matured, he sought greater freedom of expression than rhyme allowed. Rhyme was still used to indicate a scene-ending, or to stress lines that he wished the audience to remember. Generally, though, Shakespeare moved toward the rhythms of everyday speech. This gave him many dramatic advantages, which he fully and subtly exploits in terms of atmosphere, character, emotion, stress and pace.\n\nIt is Shakespeare’s poetic imagery, however, that most distinguishes his verse from that of lesser playwrights. It enables him to stretch the imagination, express complex thought-patterns in memorable language, and convey a number of associated ideas in compressed and economical form. A study of Shakespeare’s imagery – especially in his later plays – is often the key to a full understanding of his meaning and purposes.\n\nAt the other extreme is prose. Shakespeare normally reserves it for servants, clowns, commoners, and pedestrian matters such as lists, messages and letters.\n\nKing Lear\n\nDate\n\nThe play was entered in the Stationer’s Register in November 1607, having been performed before King James in December 1606. It was probably written during the previous year, 1605.\n\nSources\n\nThe main plot of King Lear can be traced to several sources: The Chronicles of England , Scotland and Ireland by Ralph Holinshed (first published in 1577 and reissued in 1587), which tells the story of “Lear the Sonne of Baldud” and his three daughters “Gonorilla, Regan and Cordeilla”; John Higgins’ narrative poem in Mirror of Magistrates (1574 edition), which is written from the viewpoint of “Cordila”; an old play called The True Chronicle History of King Leir (known to have been performed in 1594, and written at least six years earlier); and Book Two of Edmund Spenser’s The Faerie Queene (1590).\n\nThe Gloucester subplot may have been suggested by an episode in Sir Philip Sidney’s Arcadia (1950) in which the King of Paphlagonia, blinded by “a hard-hearted sonne of his,” seeks a rock from which to “cast himselfe headlong to death,” led by his loyal son “poorly arayed and extreamely weather-beaten.”\n\nShakespeare always restructured and developed his source material, and though these texts (and possibly others) were part of his initial working equipment, King Lear bears only a token resemblance to the older stories which he worked upon: for example, in Holinshed and the old chronicle play, Lear and the French army are victorious, and in neither does the King go mad.\n\nText\n\nKing Lear was first published in a Quarto version, in 1608. It was reprinted in 1619, when it was spuriously dated 1608: publishers in Elizabethan times often passed off reprints in this fraudulent way. Shakespeare was not involved in either publication. The play next appeared in the Folio edition of 1623. Hemming and Condell, the editors, are thought to have used a manuscript copy or theater prompt-book, together with the first Quarto, in compiling their text.\n\nThe Quarto omits about 100 lines that appear in the Folio. The Folio omits about 300 lines that are printed in the Quartos. No definitive text therefore exists; all editors must use discretion in preparing the play for publication. This explains why editions often differ from each other.\n\nKing Lear\n\nClicking on a character’s name in the original text will link you to the corresponding modern version text and vice versa.\n\nThe characters\n\nLear King of Britain\n\nKing of France\n\nDuke of Burgundy\n\nDuke of Cornwall Regan’s husband\n\nDuke of Albany Goneril’s husband\n\nEarl of Kent\n\nEarl of Gloucester\n\nEdgar Gloucester’s legitimate son\n\nEdmund Gloucester’s bastard son\n\nCuran a courtier\n\nOld Man Gloucester’s tenant\n\nDoctor\n\nFool\n\nOswald Goneril’s steward\n\nA Captain employed by Edmund\n\nGentleman in the service of Cordelia\n\nHerald\n\nServants to Cornwall\n \nKnights attending on Lear; Officers, Messengers, Soldiers and Attendants\n\nOriginal Text\n\nAct one\n\nScene 1\n\nKing Lear’s Palace.

Do\n\nyou smell a fault?\n\nKent I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so\n\nproper.\n\nGloucester But I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year\n\nelder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though\n\nthis knave came something saucily to the world before he\n\nwas sent for, yet was his mother fair; there was good sport\n\nat his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledged.\n\nDo you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?\n\nEdmund No, my lord.\n\nGloucester My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter\n\nas my honourable friend.\n\nEdmund My services to your lordship.\n\nKent I must love you, and sue to know you better.\n\nEdmund Sir, I shall study deserving.\n\nGloucester He hath been out nine years, and away he shall\n\nagain.

Our son of Cornwall,\n\nAnd you, our no less loving son of Albany,\n\nWe have this hour a constant will to publish\n\nOur daughters’ several dowers, that future strife\n\nMay be prevented now. The princes, France and\n\nBurgundy,\n\nGreat rivals in our youngest daughter’s love,\n\nLong in our court have made their amorous sojourn,\n\nAnd here are to be answered.

Goneril,\n\nOur eldest-born, speak first.\n\nGoneril Sir, I love you more than words can wield the\n\nmatter;\n\nDearer than eye-sight, space and liberty;\n\nBeyond what can be valued rich or rare;\n\nNo less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;\n\nAs much as child e’er loved, or father found;\n\nA love that makes breath poor and speech unable;\n\nBeyond all manner of so much I love you.\n\nCordelia [ aside ] What shall Cordelia speak?

What says our second daughter,\n\nOur dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak.\n\nRegan I am made of that self metal as my sister,\n\nAnd prize me at her worth. In my true heart\n\nI find she names my very deed of love:\n\nOnly she comes too short: that I profess\n\nMyself an enemy to all other joys\n\nWhich the most precious square of sense possesses,\n\nAnd find I am alone felicitate\n\nIn your dear Highness’ love.\n\nCordelia [ aside ] Then poor Cordelia!\n\nAnd yet not so; since I am sure my love’s\n\nMore ponderous than my tongue.\n\nLear To thee and thine, hereditary ever,\n\nRemain this ample third of our fair kingdom,\n\nNo less in space, validity, and pleasure,\n\nThan that conferred on Goneril.

Sure, her offence\n\nMust be of such unnatural degree\n\nThat monsters it, or your fore-vouched affection\n\nFall into taint; which to believe of her,\n\nMust be a faith that reason without miracle\n\nShould never plant in me.\n\nCordelia I yet beseech your Majesty –\n\nIf for I want that glib and oily art\n\nTo speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,\n\nI’ll do’t before I speak – that you make known\n\nIt is no vicious blot, murder or foulness,\n\nNo unchaste action, or dishonoured step,\n\nThat hath deprived me of your grace and favour,\n\nBut even for want of that for which I am richer,\n\nA still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue\n\nThat I am glad I have not, though not to have it\n\nHath lost me in your liking.\n\nLear Better thou\n\nHadst not been born than not t’have pleased me better.\n\nFrance Is it but this?

[ Putting up the\n\nletter ]\n\nGloucester Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?\n\nEdmund I know no news, my lord.\n\nGloucester What paper were you reading?\n\nEdmund Nothing, my lord.\n\nGloucester No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of\n\nit into your pocket? The quality of nothing hath not such\n\nneed to hide itself. Let’s see: come; if it be nothing, I shall\n\nnot need spectacles.\n\nEdmund I beseech you, sir, pardon me; it is a letter from my\n\nbrother that I have not all o’erread, and for so much as I\n\nhave perused, I find it not fit for your o’erlooking.\n\nGloucester Give me the letter, sir.\n\nEdmund I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The\n\ncontents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.\n\nGloucester Let’s see, let’s see.\n\nEdmund I hope, for my brother’s justification, he wrote this\n\nbut as an essay or taste of my virtue.\n\nGloucester [ reads ] This policy and reverence of age makes the\n\nworld bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from\n\nus till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle\n\nand fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny, who\n\nsways, not as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to me,\n\nthat of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I\n\nwaked him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and\n\nlive the beloved of your brother , Edgar.\n\nHum! Conspiracy! ‘Sleep till I waked him, you should\n\nenjoy half his revenue.’ My son Edgar! Had he a hand to\n\nwrite this? A heart and brain to breed it in? When came\n\nyou to this? Who brought it?\n\nEdmund It was not brought me, my lord; there’s the cunning\n\nof it; I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.\n\nGloucester You know the character to be your brother’s?\n\nEdmund If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it\n\nwere his; but, in respect of that, I would fain think it were\n\nnot.\n\nGloucester It is his.\n\nEdmund It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not\n\nin the contents.\n\nGloucester Has he never before sounded you in this\n\nbusiness?\n\nEdmund Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain\n\nit to be fit that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declined,\n\nthe father should be as ward to the son, and the son\n\nmanage his revenue.\n\nGloucester O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter!\n\nAbhorred villain! Unnatural detested, brutish villain!\n\nWorse than brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him; I’ll apprehend\n\nhim. Abominable villain! Where is he?\n\nEdmund I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you\n\nto suspend your indignation against my brother till you can\n\nderive from him better testimony of his intent, you should\n\nrun a certain course; where, if you violently proceed against\n\nhim, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great gap in\n\nyour own honour, and shake in pieces the heart of his\n\nobedience. I dare pawn down my life for him, that he hath\n\nwrit this to feel my affection to your honour, and to no\n\nother pretence of danger.\n\nGloucester Think you so?\n\nEdmund If your honour judge it meet, I will place you\n\nwhere you shall hear us confer of this, and by an auricular\n\nassurance have your satisfaction; and that without any\n\nfurther delay than this very evening.\n\nGloucester He cannot be such a monster.\n\nEdmund Nor is not, sure.\n\nGloucester To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves\n\nhim. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me\n\ninto him, I pray you: frame the business after your own\n\nwisdom. I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution.\n\nEdmund I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business\n\nas I shall find means, and acquaint you withal.\n\nGloucester These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend\n\nno good to us: though the wisdom of nature can reason it\n\nthus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the\n\nsequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers\n\ndivide: in cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces,\n\ntreason; and the bond cracked ’twixt son and father. This\n\nvillain of mine comes under the prediction; there’s son\n\nagainst father: the King falls from bias of nature; there’s\n\nfather against child. We have seen the best of our time:\n\nmachinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous\n\ndisorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this\n\nvillain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing: do it carefully.\n\nAnd the noble and true-hearted Kent banished! His offence,\n\nhonesty! ’Tis strange.\n\n[ Exit ]\n\nEdmund This is the excellent foppery of the world, that,\n\nwhen we are sick in fortune, often the surfeit of our own\n\nbehaviour, we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the\n\nmoon, and stars; as if we were villains by necessity, fools by\n\nheavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and treachers by\n\nspherical predominance; drunkards, liars, and adulterers by\n\nan enforced obedience of planetary influence; and all that we\n\nare evil in, by a divine thrusting on.

But where’s my Fool? I have not seen him this two\n\ndays.\n\nKnight Since my young lady’s going into France, sir, the\n\nFool hath much pined away.\n\nLear No more of that; I have noted it well.

[ Striking\n\nhim ]\n\nOswald I’ll not be struck, my lord.\n\nKent Nor tripped neither, you base football player. [ Trip-\n\nping up his heels ]\n\nLear I thank thee, fellow; thou servest me, and I’ll love thee.\n\nKent Come, sir, arise, away! I’ll teach you differences: away,\n\naway! If you will measure your lubber’s length again, tarry;\n\nbut away! Have you wisdom? [ Exit  Oswald ] So.\n\nLear Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there’s earnest\n\nof thy service.

How dost thou?\n\nFool Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.\n\nKent Why, Fool?\n\nFool Why, for taking one’s part that’s out of favour. Nay,\n\nand thou canst not smile as the wind sits, thou’lt catch cold\n\nshortly: there, take my coxcomb. Why, this fellow has\n\nbanished two on’s daughters, and did the third a blessing\n\nagainst his will: if thou follow him thou must needs wear\n\nmy coxcomb. How now, nuncle! Would I had two cox-\n\ncombs and two daughters!\n\nLear Why, my boy?\n\nFool If I gave them all my living, I’d keep my coxcombs\n\nmyself. There’s mine; beg another of thy daughters.\n\nLear Take heed, sirrah; the whip.\n\nFool Truth’s a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped out\n\nwhen Lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink.\n\nLear A pestilent gall to me!\n\nFool Sirrah, I’ll teach thee a speech.\n\nLear Do.\n\nFool Mark it, nuncle:\n\nHave more than thou showest,\n\nSpeak less than thou knowest,\n\nLend less than thou owest,\n\nRide more than thou goest,\n\nLearn more than thou trowest,\n\nSet less than thou throwest;\n\nLeave thy drink and thy whore\n\nAnd keep in-a-door,\n\nAnd thou shalt have more\n\nThan two tens to a score.\n\nKent This is nothing, Fool.\n\nFool Then ’tis like the breath of an unfee’d lawyer; you give\n\nme nothing for’t. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?\n\nLear Why no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.\n\nFool [ to  Kent ] Prithee, tell him, so much the rent of his\n\nland comes to: he will not believe a Fool.\n\nLear A bitter Fool!\n\nFool Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a\n\nbitter Fool and a sweet one?\n\nLear No, lad; teach me.\n\nFool That lord that counselled thee\n\nTo give away thy land,\n\nCome place him here by me;\n\nDo thou for him stand:\n\nThe sweet and bitter fool\n\nWill presently appear;\n\nThe one in motley here,\n\nThe other found out there.\n\nLear Dost thou call me fool, boy?\n\nFool All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast\n\nborn with.\n\nKent This is not altogether fool, my lord.\n\nFool No, faith, lords and great men will not let me; if I had\n\na monopoly out, they would have part on’t: and ladies too,\n\nthey will not let me have all the fool to myself: they’ll be\n\nsnatching. Nuncle, give me an egg, and I’ll give thee two\n\ncrowns.\n\nLear What two crowns shall they be?\n\nFool Why, after I have cut the egg i’ th’ middle and eat up\n\nthe meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy\n\ncrown i’ th’ middle, and gavest away both parts, thou\n\nborest thine ass on thy back o’ er the dirt: thou hadst little\n\nwit in thy bald crown when thou gavest thy golden one\n\naway. If I speak like myself in this, let him be whipped that\n\nfirst find it so.\n\n[ Singing ]\n\nFools had ne’er less grace in a year;\n\nFor wise men are grown foppish ,\n\nAnd know not how their wits to wear ,\n\nTheir manners are so apish.\n\nLear When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?\n\nFool I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy\n\ndaughters thy mothers; for when thou gavest them the rod\n\nand puttest down thine own breeches,\n\n[ Singing ]\n\nThen they for sudden joy did weep ,\n\nAnd I for sorrow sung ,\n\nThat such a king should play bo-peep,\n\nAnd go the fools among.\n\nPrithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster than can teach thy\n\nFool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.\n\nLear An you lie, sirrah, we’ll have you whipped.\n\nFool I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are: they’ll\n\nhave me whipped for speaking true, thou’t have me\n\nwhipped for lying; and sometimes I am whipped for holding\n\nmy peace.

I have nothing to do with thee.\n\nKent Draw, you rascal; you come with letters against the\n\nKing, and take vanity the puppet’s part against the royalty of\n\nher father. Draw, you rogue, or I’ll so carbonado your\n\nshanks: draw, you rascal; come your ways.\n\nOswald Help, ho! Murder! Help!\n\nKent Strike, you slave; stand, rogue, stand; you neat slave,\n\nstrike.\n\n[ Beating him ]\n\nOswald Help, ho! Murder! Murder!\n\n[ Enter  Edmund,  with his rapier drawn ]\n\nEdmund How now! What’s the matter? Part!\n\nKent With you, goodman boy, if you please: come, I’ll flesh ye;\n\ncome on, young master.\n\n[ Enter  Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester,  and Servants ]\n\nGloucester Weapons!

What is the matter?\n\nRegan The messengers from our sister and the King.\n\nCornwall What is your difference? Speak.\n\nOswald I am scarce in breath, my lord.\n\nKent No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You\n\ncowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a tailor made thee.\n\nCornwall Thou art a strange fellow; a tailor make a man?\n\nKent A tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or a painter could not have\n\nmade him so ill, though they had been but two years\n\no’ th’ trade.\n\nCornwall Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?\n\nOswald This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared at\n\nsuit of his grey beard –\n\nKent Thou whoreson zed! Thou unnecessary letter! My lord,\n\nif you will give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain\n\ninto mortar, and daub the wall of a jakes with him. Spare my\n\ngrey beard, you wagtail?\n\nCornwall Peace, sirrah! You beastly knave, know you no\n\nreverence?\n\nKent Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.\n\nCornwall Why art thou angry?\n\nKent That such a slave as this should wear a sword,\n\nWho wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,\n\nLike rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain\n\nWhich are too intrinse t’unloose; smooth every passion\n\nThat in the natures of their lords rebel;\n\nBring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;\n\nRenege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks\n\nWith every gale and vary of their masters,\n\nKnowing nought, like dogs, but following.\n\nA plague upon your epileptic visage!\n\nSmile you my speeches, as I were a fool?\n\nGoose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,\n\nI’d drive ye cackling home to Camelot.\n\nCornwall What, art thou mad, old fellow?\n\nGloucester How fell you out? Say that.\n\nKent No contraries hold more antipathy\n\nThan I and such a knave.\n\nCornwall Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?\n\nKent His countenance likes me not.\n\nCornwall No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.\n\nKent Sir, ’tis my occupation to be plain:\n\nI have seen better faces in my time\n\nThan stands on any shoulder that I see\n\nBefore me at this instant.\n\nCornwall This is some fellow,\n\nWho, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect\n\nA saucy roughness, and constrains the garb\n\nQuite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,\n\nAn honest mind and plain, he must speak truth:\n\nAnd they will take it, so; if not, he’s plain.\n\nThese kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness\n\nHarbour more craft and more corrupter ends\n\nThan twenty silly ducking observants,\n\nThat stretch their duties nicely.\n\nKent Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,\n\nUnder th’ allowance of your great aspect,\n\nWhose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire\n\nOn flickering Phoebus’ front –\n\nCornwall What mean’st by this?\n\nKent To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so\n\nmuch. I know, sir, I am no flatterer: he that beguiled you in\n\na plain accent was a plain knave; which for my part I will not\n\nbe, though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to’t.\n\nCornwall What was the offence you gave him?\n\nOswald I never gave him any:\n\nIt pleased the King his master very late\n\nTo strike at me, upon his misconstruction;\n\nWhen he, compact, and flattering his displeasure,\n\nTripped me behind; being down, insulted, railed,\n\nAnd put upon him such a deal of man,\n\nThat worthied him, got praises of the King\n\nFor him attempting who was self-subdued;\n\nAnd, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,\n\nDrew on me here again.\n\nKent None of these rogues and cowards\n\nBut Ajax is their fool.\n\nCornwall Fetch forth the stocks!\n\nYou stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,\n\nWe’ll teach you.\n\nKent Sir, I am too old to learn.\n\nCall not your stocks for me; I serve the King,\n\nOn whose employment I was sent to you;\n\nYou shall do small respect, show too bold malice\n\nAgainst the grace and person of my master,\n\nStocking his messenger.\n\nCornwall Fetch forth the stocks!\n\nAs I have life and honour, there shall he sit till noon.\n\nRegan Till noon! Till night, my lord; and all night too.\n\nKent Why, madam, if I were your father’s dog,\n\nYou should not use me so.\n\nRegan Sir, being his knave, I will.\n\nCornwall This is a fellow of the self-same colour\n\nOur sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks.\n\n[ Stocks brought out ]\n\nGloucester Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.\n\nHis fault is much, and the good King his master\n\nWill check him for’t: your purposed low correction\n\nIs such as basest and contemned’st wretches\n\nFor pilferings and most common trespasses\n\nAre punished with: the King must take it ill,\n\nThat he, so slightly valued in his messenger,\n\nShould have him thus restrained.\n\nCornwall I’ll answer that.\n\nRegan My sister may receive it much more worse\n\nTo have her gentleman abused, assaulted,\n\nFor following her affairs. Put in his legs.\n\n[ Kent  is put in the stocks ]\n\nCornwall Come, my lord, away.\n\n[ Exeunt all but  Gloucester  and  Kent ]\n\nGloucester I am sorry for thee, friend; ’tis the Duke’s\n\npleasure,\n\nWhose disposition, all the world well knows,\n\nWill not be rubbed nor stopped: I’ll entreat for thee.\n\nKent Pray, do not, sir. I have watched and travelled hard;\n\nSome time I shall sleep out, the rest I’ll whistle.\n\nA good man’s fortune may grow out at heels:\n\nGive you good morrow!\n\nGloucester The Duke’s to blame in this; ’twill be ill taken.\n\n[ Exit ]\n\nKent Good King, that must approve the common saw,\n\nThou out of heaven’s benediction comest\n\nTo the warm sun!\n\nApproach, thou beacon to this under globe,\n\nThat by thy comfortable beams I may\n\nPeruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles,\n\nBut misery: I know ’tis from Cordelia,\n\nWho hath most fortunately been informed\n\nOf my obscured course; and shall find time\n\nFrom this enormous state, seeking to give\n\nLosses their remedies.

No port is free; no place\n\nThat guard, and most unusual vigilance,\n\nDoes not attend my taking. Whiles I may ’scape,\n\nI will preserve myself; and am bethought\n\nTo take the basest and most poorest shape\n\nThat ever penury, in contempt of man,\n\nBrought near to beast; my face I’ll grime with filth,\n\nBlanket my loins, elf all my hairs in knots,\n\nAnd with presented nakedness outface\n\nThe winds and persecutions of the sky.\n\nThe country gives me proof and precedent\n\nOf Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,\n\nStrike in their numbed and mortified bare arms\n\nPins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;\n\nAnd with this horrible object, from low farms,\n\nPoor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,\n\nSometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,\n\nEnforce their charity.

He wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by the\n\nheads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by the loins,\n\nand men by the legs: when a man’s over-lusty at legs then\n\nhe wears wooden nether-stocks.\n\nLear What’s he that hath so much thy place mistook\n\nTo set thee here?\n\nKent It is both he and she,\n\nYour son and daughter.\n\nLear No.\n\nKent Yes.\n\nLear No, I say.\n\nKent I say, yea.\n\nLear No, no; they would not.\n\nKent Yes, yes, they have.\n\nLear By Jupiter, I swear, no.\n\nKent By Juno, I swear, ay.\n\nLear They durst not do’t.\n\nThey could not, would not do’t; ’tis worse than murder,\n\nTo do upon respect such violent outrage.\n\nResolve me, with all modest haste, which way\n\nThou might’st deserve, or they impose, this usage,\n\nComing from us.\n\nKent My lord, when at their home\n\nI did commend your Highness’ letters to them,\n\nEre I was risen from the place that showed\n\nMy duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,\n\nStewed in his haste, half breathless, panting forth\n\nFrom Goneril his mistress salutations;\n\nDelivered letters, spite of intermission,\n\nWhich presently they read: on whose contents\n\nThey summoned up their meiny, straight took horse;\n\nCommanded me to follow, and attend\n\nThe leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:\n\nAnd meeting here the other messenger,\n\nWhose welcome, I perceived, had poisoned mine –\n\nBeing the very fellow which of late\n\nDisplay’d so saucily against your Highness –\n\nHaving more man than wit about me, drew:\n\nHe raised the house with loud and coward cries.\n\nYour son and daughter found this trespass worth\n\nThe shame which here it suffers.\n\nFool Winter’s not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way.\n\nFathers that wear rags\n\nDo make their children blind,\n\nBut fathers that bear bags\n\nShall see their children kind.\n\nFortune, that arrant whore,\n\nNe’er turns the key to the poor,\n\nBut for all this thou shalt have as many dolours for thy\n\ndaughters as thou canst tell in a year.\n\nLear O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!\n\nHysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow;\n\nThy element’s below.

I have hope\n\nYou less know how to value her desert\n\nThan she to scant her duty.\n\nLear Say? How is that?\n\nRegan I cannot think my sister in the least\n\nWould fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance\n\nShe have restrained the riots of your followers,\n\n’Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,\n\nAs clears her from all blame.\n\nLear My curses on her!\n\nRegan O sir, you are old;\n\nNature in you stands on the very verge\n\nOf her confine: you should be ruled and led\n\nBy some discretion that discerns your state\n\nBetter than you yourself. Therefore I pray you\n\nThat to our sister you do make return;\n\nSay you have wronged her.\n\nLear Ask her forgiveness?\n\nDo you but mark how this becomes the house:\n\n[ Kneeling ] ‘Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;\n\nAge is unnecessary: on my knees I beg\n\nThat you’ll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.’\n\nRegan Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks.\n\nReturn you to my sister.\n\nLear Never, Regan.\n\nShe hath abated me of half my train;\n\nLooked black upon me; struck me with her tongue,\n\nMost serpent-like, upon the very heart.\n\nAll the stored vengeances of heaven fall\n\nOn her ingrateful top!

How came my man i’ th’ stocks?\n\nCornwall I set him there, sir; but his own disorders\n\nDeserved much less advancement.\n\nLear You! Did you?\n\nRegan I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.\n\nIf, till the expiration of your month,\n\nYou will return and sojourn with my sister,\n\nDismissing half your train, come then to me:\n\nI am now from home, and out of that provision\n\nWhich shall be needful for your entertainment.\n\nLear Return to her? And fifty men dismissed?\n\nNo, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose\n\nTo wage against the enmity o’ th’ air;\n\nTo be a comrade with the wolf and owl,\n\nNecessity’s sharp pinch! Return with her!\n\nWhy, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took\n\nOur youngest born, I could as well be brought\n\nTo knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg\n\nTo keep base life afoot.

But I’ll not chide thee;\n\nLet shame come when it will, I do not call it;\n\nI do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,\n\nNor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.\n\nMend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure;\n\nI can be patient; I can stay with Regan,\n\nI and my hundred knights.\n\nRegan Not altogether so;\n\nI looked not for you yet, nor am provided\n\nFor your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;\n\nFor those that mingle reason with your passion\n\nMust be content to think you old, and so –\n\nBut she knows what she does.\n\nLear Is this well spoken?\n\nRegan I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?\n\nIs it not well? What should you need of more?\n\nYea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger\n\nSpeak ’gainst so great a number? How, in one house,\n\nShould many people, under two commands,\n\nHold amity? ’Tis hard; almost impossible.\n\nGoneril Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance\n\nFrom those that she calls servants, or from mine?\n\nRegan Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,\n\nWe could control them. If you will come to me,\n\nFor now I spy a danger, I entreat you\n\nTo bring but five-and-twenty; to no more\n\nWill I give place or notice.\n\nLear I gave you all –\n\nRegan And in good time you gave it.\n\nLear Made you my guardians, my depositaries,\n\nBut kept a reservation to be followed\n\nWith such a number.

Thou art a lady;\n\nIf only to go warm were gorgeous,\n\nWhy, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear’st,\n\nWhich scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need –\n\nYou heavens, give me that patience, patience I need! –\n\nYou see me here, you gods, a poor old man,\n\nAs full of grief as age; wretched in both!\n\nIf it be you that stirs these daughters’ hearts\n\nAgainst their father, fool me not so much\n\nTo bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,\n\nAnd let not women’s weapons, water-drops,\n\nStain my man’s cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,\n\nI will have such revenges on you both\n\nThat all the world shall – I will do such things,\n\nWhat they are, yet I know not, but they shall be\n\nThe terrors of the earth. You think I’ll weep;\n\nNo, I’ll not weep:\n\nI have full cause of weeping, but this heart\n\nShall break into a hundred thousand flaws\n\nOr ere I’ll weep. O Fool!

Now to you:\n\nIf on my credit you dare build so far\n\nTo make your speed to Dover, you shall find\n\nSome that will thank you, making just report\n\nOf how unnatural and bemadding sorrow\n\nThe King hath cause to plain.\n\nI am a gentleman of blood and breeding,\n\nAnd from some knowledge and assurance offer\n\nThis office to you.\n\nGentleman I will talk further with you.\n\nKent No, do not.\n\nFor confirmation that I am much more\n\nThan my out-wall, open this purse and take\n\nWhat it contains.

Spout, rain!\n\nNor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters;\n\nI tax you not, you elements, with unkindness;\n\nI never gave you kingdom, called you children,\n\nYou owe me no subscription: then let fall\n\nYour horrible pleasure; here I stand, your slave,\n\nA poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man.\n\nBut yet I call you servile ministers,\n\nThat will with two pernicious daughters join\n\nYour high-engendered battles ’gainst a head\n\nSo old and white as this.

Things that love night\n\nLove not such nights as these; the wrathful skies\n\nGallow the very wanderers of the dark,\n\nAnd make them keep their caves. Since I was man\n\nSuch sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,\n\nSuch groans of roaring wind and rain, I never\n\nRemember to have heard; man’s nature cannot carry\n\nTh’ affliction nor the fear.\n\nLear Let the great gods,\n\nThat keep this dreadful pudder o’ er our heads,\n\nFind out their enemies now.

There is division\n\nbetween the Dukes, and a worse matter than that. I have\n\nreceived a letter this night; ’tis dangerous to be spoken; I\n\nhave locked the letter in my closet. These injuries the King\n\nnow bears will be revenged home; there is part of a power\n\nalready footed; we must incline to the King. I will seek him\n\nand privily relieve him; go you and maintain talk with the\n\nDuke, that my charity be not of him perceived. If he ask\n\nfor me, I am ill and gone to bed. If I die for it, as no less is\n\nthreatened me, the King, my old master, must be relieved.\n\nThere is strange things toward, Edmund; pray you, be\n\ncareful.\n\n[ Exit ]\n\nEdmund This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the Duke\n\nInstantly know, and of that letter too:\n\nThis seems a fair deserving, and must draw me\n\nThat which my father loses; no less than all:\n\nThe younger rises when the old doth fall.\n\n[ Exit ]\n\nScene 4\n\nThe heath.

Good my lord, enter.\n\nLear Thou think’st ’tis much that this contentious storm\n\nInvades us to the skin: so ’tis to thee;\n\nBut where the greater malady is fixed,\n\nThe lesser is scarce felt. Thou’ldst shun a bear;\n\nBut if thy flight lay toward the roaring sea,\n\nThou’ldst meet the bear i’ th’ mouth. When the mind’s free\n\nThe body’s delicate; this tempest in my mind\n\nDoth from my senses take all feeling else\n\nSave what beats there – filial ingratitude!\n\nIs it not as this mouth should tear this hand\n\nFor lifting food to’t? But I will punish home:\n\nNo, I will weep no more. In such a night\n\nTo shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.\n\nIn such a night as this!

Go to thy bed and\n\nwarm thee.\n\nLear Didst thou give all to thy daughters?\n\nAnd art thou come to this?\n\nEdgar Who gives any thing to poor Tom? Whom the foul\n\nfiend hath led through fire and through flame, through ford\n\nand whirlpool, o’ er bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives\n\nunder his pillow, and halters in his pew; set ratsbane by his\n\nporridge; made him proud of heart, to ride on a bay\n\ntrotting-horse over four-inched bridges, to course his own\n\nshadow for a traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom’s a-cold. O,\n\ndo de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-\n\nblasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some charity, whom the\n\nfoul fiend vexes. There could I have him now, and there,\n\nand there again, and there.\n\nLear What! have his daughters brought him to this pass?\n\nCould’st thou save nothing? Would’st thou give ’em all?\n\nFool Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all\n\nshamed.\n\nLear Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air\n\nHang fated o’ er men’s faults light on thy daughters!\n\nKent He hath no daughters, sir.\n\nLear Death, traitor! Nothing could have subdued nature\n\nTo such a lowness but his unkind daughters.\n\nIs it the fashion that discarded fathers\n\nShould have thus little mercy on their flesh?\n\nJudicious punishment! ’twas this flesh begot\n\nThose pelican daughters.\n\nEdgar Pillicock sat on Pillicock hill:\n\nAlow, alow, loo, loo!\n\nFool This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.\n\nEdgar Take heed o’ th’ foul fiend. Obey thy parents: keep\n\nthy word justly; swear not; commit not with man’s sworn\n\nspouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud array. Tom’s a-cold.\n\nLear What hast thou been?\n\nEdgar A servingman, proud in heart and mind; that curled\n\nmy hair, wore gloves in my cap, served the lust of my\n\nmistress’ heart, and did the act of darkness with her; swore\n\nas many oaths as I spake words, and broke them in the\n\nsweet face of Heaven; one that slept in the contriving of\n\nlust, and waked to do it. Wine loved I deeply, dice dearly,\n\nand in woman out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light\n\nof ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in\n\ngreediness, dog in madness, lion in prey. Let not the\n\ncreaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy poor\n\nheart to woman: keep thy foot out of brothels, thy hand out\n\nof plackets, thy pen from lenders’ books, and defy the foul\n\nfiend. Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind; says\n\nsuum, mun, hey no nonny. Dolphin my boy, boy; sessa! let\n\nhim trot by.\n\nLear Thou wert better in a grave than to answer with thy\n\nuncovered body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more\n\nthan this? Consider him well. Thou owest the worm no\n\nsilk, the beast no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no\n\nperfume. Ha! here’s three on ’s are sophisticated; thou art\n\nthe thing itself; unaccommodated man is no more but such a\n\npoor, bare, forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings!\n\nCome; unbutton here. [ Tearing off his clothes ]\n\nFool Prithee, nuncle, be contented; ’tis a naughty night to\n\nswim in. Now a little fire in a wide field were like an old\n\nlecher’s heart; a small spark, all the rest on ’s body cold.\n\nLook! here comes a walking fire.\n\n[ Enter  Gloucester  with a torch ]\n\nEdgar This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins at\n\ncurfew, and walks till the first cock; he gives the web and\n\nthe pin, squinies the eye, and makes the harelip; mildews\n\nthe white wheat, and hurts the poor creature of earth.\n\nSwithold footed thrice the old;\n\nHe met the night-mare, and her nine-fold;\n\nBid her alight,\n\nAnd her troth plight,\n\nAnd aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!\n\nKent How fares your Grace?\n\nLear What’s he?\n\nKent Who’s there? What is’t you seek?\n\nGloucester What are you there? Your names?\n\nEdgar Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the\n\ntadpole, the wall-newt, and the water; that in the fury of his\n\nheart, when the foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for sallets;\n\nswallows the old rat and the ditch-dog; drinks the green\n\nmantle of the standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to\n\ntithing, and stock-punished, and imprisoned; who hath had\n\nthree suits to his back, six shirts to his body, horse to ride,\n\nand weapon to wear,\n\nBut mice and rats and such small deer,\n\nHave been Tom’s food for seven long year.\n\nBeware my follower. Peace, Smulkin! Peace, thou fiend!\n\nGloucester What, hath your Grace no better company?\n\nEdgar The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman; Modo he’s\n\ncalled, and Mahu.\n\nGloucester Our flesh and blood, my lord, is grown so vile,\n\nThat it doth hate what gets it.\n\nEdgar Poor Tom’s a-cold.\n\nGloucester Go in with me. My duty cannot suffer\n\nT’obey in all your daughters’ hard commands;\n\nThough their injunction be to bar my doors,\n\nAnd let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,\n\nYet I have ventured to come and seek you out\n\nAnd bring you where both fire and food is ready.\n\nLear First let me talk with this philosopher.\n\nWhat is the cause of thunder?\n\nKent Good my lord, take his offer; go into the house.\n\nLear I’ll talk a word with this same learned Theban.\n\nWhat is your study?\n\nEdgar How to prevent the fiend, and to kill vermin.\n\nLear Let me ask you one word in private.\n\nKent Importune him once more to go, my lord;\n\nHis wits begin t’unsettle.\n\nGloucester Canst thou blame him?\n\nHis daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent;\n\nHe said it would be thus, poor banished man!\n\nThou say’st the King grows mad; I’ll tell thee, friend,\n\nI am almost mad myself. I had a son,\n\nNow outlawed from my blood; he sought my life,\n\nBut lately, very late; I loved him, friend,\n\nNo father his son dearer; truth to tell thee,\n\nThe grief hath crazed my wits. What a night’s this!\n\nI do beseech your Grace –\n\nLear Oh, cry you mercy, sir:\n\nNoble philosopher, your company.\n\nEdgar Tom’s a-cold.\n\nGloucester In, fellow, there, into the hovel: keep thee warm.\n\nLear Come, let’s in all.\n\nKent This way, my lord.\n\nLear With him;\n\nI will keep still with my philosopher.\n\nKent Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.\n\nGloucester Take him you on.\n\nKent Sirrah, come on; go along with us.\n\nLear Come, good Athenian.\n\nGloucester No words, no words: hush.\n\nEdgar Child Rowland to the dark tower came,\n\nHis word was still: ‘Fie, foh, and fum,\n\nI smell the blood of a British man.’\n\n[ Exeunt ]\n\nScene 5\n\nGloucester’s castle.

This is the letter he spoke of, which approves him\n\nan intelligent party to the advantages of France. O\n\nheavens, that this treason were not, or not I the detector!\n\nCornwall Go with me to the Duchess.\n\nEdmund If the matter of this paper be certain, you have\n\nmighty business in hand.\n\nCornwall True or false, it hath made thee Earl of\n\nGloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he may be\n\nready for our apprehension.\n\nEdmund [ aside ] If I find him comforting the King, it will\n\nstuff his suspicion more fully.

O you gods!\n\nRegan One side will mock another; the other too.\n\nCornwall If you see vengeance –\n\n1st Servant Hold your hand, my lord.\n\nI have served you ever since I was a child,\n\nBut better service have I never done you\n\nThan now to bid you hold.\n\nRegan How now, you dog!\n\n1st Servant If you did wear a beard upon your chin\n\nI’d shake it on this quarrel.\n\nRegan What do you mean?\n\nCornwall My villain! [ They draw and fight ]\n\n1st Servant Nay then, come on, and take the chance of anger.\n\nRegan Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!\n\n[ Takes a sword and runs at him behind ]\n\n1st Servant O, I am slain. My lord, you have one eye left\n\nTo see some mischief on him. O! [ Dies ]\n\nCornwall Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!\n\nWhere is thy lustre now?\n\nGloucester All dark and comfortless. Where’s my son\n\nEdmund?\n\nEdmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature\n\nTo quit this horrid act.\n\nRegan Out, treacherous villain!\n\nThou call’st on him that hates thee; it was he\n\nThat made the overture of thy treasons to us,\n\nWho is too good to pity thee.\n\nGloucester O my follies! Then Edgar was abused.\n\nKind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!\n\nRegan Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell\n\nHis way to Dover. [ Exit one with  Gloucester ]\n\nHow is’t, my lord. How look you?\n\nCornwall I have received a hurt. Follow me, lady.\n\nTurn out that eyeless villain; throw this slave\n\nUpon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace:\n\nUntimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.\n\n[ Exit  Cornwall,  led by  Regan ]\n\n2nd Servant I’ll never care what wickedness I do\n\nIf this man come to good.\n\n3rd Servant If she live long,\n\nAnd in the end meet the old course of death,\n\nWomen will all turn monsters.\n\n2nd Servant Let’s follow the old Earl, and get the Bedlam\n\nTo lead him where he would: his roguish madness\n\nAllows itself to any thing.\n\n3rd Servant Go thou; I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs\n\nTo apply to his bleeding face. Now, heaven help him!\n\n[ Exeunt severally ]\n\nAct four\n\nScene 1\n\nThe heath. Enter  Edgar.\n\nEdgar Yet better thus, and known to be contemned,\n\nThan, still contemned and flattered, to be worst.\n\nThe lowest and most dejected thing of fortune\n\nStands still in esperance, lives not in fear:\n\nThe lamentable change is from the best;\n\nThe worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,\n\nThou unsubstantial air that I embrace:\n\nThe wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst\n\nOwes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?\n\n[ Enter  Gloucester,  led by an  Old Man ]\n\nMy father, poorly led? World, world, o, world!\n\nBut that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,\n\nLife would not yield to age.\n\nOld Man O my good lord!\n\nI have been your tenant, and your father’s tenant,\n\nThese fourscore years.\n\nGloucester Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone:\n\nThy comforts can do me no good at all;\n\nThee they may hurt.\n\nOld Man You cannot see your way.\n\nGloucester I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;\n\nI stumbled when I saw. Full oft ’tis seen,\n\nOur means secure us, and our mere defects\n\nProve our commodities. Ah, dear son Edgar,\n\nThe food of thy abused father’s wrath;\n\nMight I but live to see thee in my touch,\n\nI’d say I had eyes again.\n\nOld Man How now! Who’s there?\n\nEdgar [ aside ] O gods! Who is’t can say ‘I am at the worst’?\n\nI am worse than e’er I was.\n\nOld Man ’Tis poor mad Tom.\n\nEdgar [ aside ] And worse I may be yet; the worst is not\n\nSo long as we can say ‘This is the worst’.\n\nOld Man Fellow, where goest?\n\nGloucester Is it a beggar man?\n\nOld Man Madman and beggar too.\n\nGloucester He has some reason, else he could not beg.\n\nI’ th’ last night’s storm I such a fellow saw,\n\nWhich made me think a man a worm. My son\n\nCame then into my mind; and yet my mind\n\nWas then scarce friends with him. I have heard more since:\n\nAs flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods;\n\nThey kill us for their sport.\n\nEdgar [ aside ] How should this be?\n\nBad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,\n\nAng’ring itself and others. [ Aloud ] Bless thee, master!\n\nGloucester Is that the naked fellow?\n\nOld Man Ay, my lord.\n\nGloucester Then, prithee, get thee away. If, for my sake,\n\nThou wilt o’ertake us, hence a mile or twain,\n\nI’ th’ way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;\n\nAnd bring some covering for this naked soul,\n\nWhich I’ll entreat to lead me.\n\nOld Man Alack, sir, he is mad.\n\nGloucester ’Tis the times’ plague, when madmen lead the\n\nblind.\n\nDo as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;\n\nAbove the rest, be gone.\n\nOld Man I’ll bring him the best ’parel that I have,\n\nCome on ’t what will.\n\n[ Exit ]\n\nGloucester Sirrah, naked fellow –\n\nEdgar Poor Tom’s a-cold. [ Aside ] I cannot daub it further.\n\nGloucester Come hither, fellow.\n\nEdgar [ aside ] And yet I must. Bless thy sweet eyes, they\n\nbleed.\n\nGloucester Know’st thou the way to Dover?\n\nEdgar Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path. Poor\n\nTom hath been scared out of his good wits: bless thee, good\n\nman’s son, from the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor\n\nTom at once: as Obidicut, of lust; Hoberdidance, prince of\n\ndumbness; Mahu, of stealing; Modo, of murder;\n\nFlibbertigibbet, of mopping and mowing; who since possesses\n\nchambermaids and waiting-women. So, bless thee, master!\n\nGloucester Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens’\n\nplagues\n\nHave humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched\n\nMakes thee the happier: heavens, deal so still!\n\nLet the superfluous and lust-dieted man,\n\nThat slaves your ordinance, that will not see\n\nBecause he does not feel, feel your power quickly;\n\nSo distribution should undo excess,\n\nAnd each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?\n\nEdgar Ay, master.\n\nGloucester There is a cliff, whose high and bending head\n\nLooks fearfully in the confined deep;\n\nBring me but to the very brim of it,\n\nAnd I’ll repair the misery thou dost bear\n\nWith something rich about me; from that place\n\nI shall no leading need.\n\nEdgar Give me thy arm:\n\nPoor Tom shall lead thee.\n\n[ Exeunt ]\n\nScene 2\n\nBefore the Duke of Albany’s palace. Enter  Goneril  and  Edmund.\n\nGoneril Welcome, my lord; I marvel our mild husband\n\nNot met us on the way.\n\n[ Enter  Oswald ]\n\nNow, where’s your master?\n\nOswald Madam, within; but never man so changed.\n\nI told him of the army that was landed;\n\nHe smiled at it: I told him you were coming;\n\nHis answer was ‘The worse’: of Gloucester’s treachery,\n\nAnd of the loyal service of his son,\n\nWhen I informed him, then he called me sot,\n\nAnd told me I had turned the wrong side out:\n\nWhat most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;\n\nWhat like, offensive.\n\nGoneril [ to  Edmund ] Then shall you go no further.\n\nIt is the cowish terror of his spirit\n\nThat dares not undertake; he’ll not feel wrongs\n\nWhich tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way\n\nMay prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;\n\nHasten his musters and conduct his powers:\n\nI must change arms at home, and give the distaff\n\nInto my husband’s hands. This trusty servant\n\nShall pass between us; ere long you are like to hear,\n\nIf you dare venture on your own behalf,\n\nA mistress’s command. Wear this; spare speech;\n\nDecline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,\n\nWould stretch thy spirits up into the air.\n\nConceive, and fare thee well.\n\nEdmund Yours in the ranks of death.\n\nGoneril My most dear Gloucester!\n\n[ Exit  Edmund ]\n\nO, the difference of man and man!\n\nTo thee a woman’s services are due:\n\nA fool usurps my bed.\n\nOswald Madam, here comes my lord.\n\n[ Exit ]\n\n[ Enter  Albany ]\n\nGoneril I have been worth the whistle.\n\nAlbany O Goneril!\n\nYou are not worth the dust which the rude wind\n\nBlows in your face. I fear your disposition:\n\nThat nature, which contemns its origin,\n\nCannot be bordered certain in itself;\n\nShe that herself will sliver and disbranch\n\nFrom her material sap, perforce must wither\n\nAnd come to deadly use.\n\nGoneril No more; the text is foolish.\n\nAlbany Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;\n\nFilths savour but themselves. What have you done?\n\nTigers, not daughters, what have you performed?\n\nA father, and a gracious aged man,\n\nWhose reverence even the head-lugged bear would lick,\n\nMost barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded.\n\nCould my good brother suffer you to do it?\n\nA man, a prince, by him so benefited!\n\nIf that the heavens do not their visible spirits\n\nSend quickly down to tame these vile offences,\n\nIt will come,\n\nHumanity must perforce prey on itself,\n\nLike monsters of the deep.\n\nGoneril Milk-livered man!\n\nThat bear’st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;\n\nWho hast not in thy brows an eye discerning\n\nThine honour from thy suffering; that not know’st\n\nFools do those villains pity who are punished\n\nEre they have done their mischief. Where’s thy drum?\n\nFrance spreads his banners in our noiseless land,\n\nWith plumed helm thy state begins to threat,\n\nWhilst thou, a moral fool, sits still, and cries\n\n‘Alack! why does he so?’\n\nAlbany See thyself, devil!\n\nProper deformity shows not in the fiend\n\nSo horrid as in woman.\n\nGoneril O vain fool!\n\nAlbany Thou changed and self-covered thing, for shame,\n\nBe-monster not thy feature. Were’t my fitness\n\nTo let these hands obey my blood,\n\nThey are apt enough to dislocate and tear\n\nThy flesh and bones; howe’ er thou art a fiend,\n\nA woman’s shape doth shield thee.\n\nGoneril Marry, your manhood mew –\n\n[ Enter a  Messenger ]\n\nAlbany What news?\n\nMessenger O my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall’s dead;\n\nSlain by his servant, going to put out\n\nThe other eye of Gloucester.\n\nAlbany Gloucester’s eyes!\n\nMessenger A servant that he bred, thrilled with remorse,\n\nOpposed against the act, bending his sword\n\nTo his great master: who, thereat enraged,\n\nFlew on him, and amongst them felled him dead;\n\nBut not without that harmful stroke, which since\n\nHath plucked him after.\n\nAlbany This shows you are above,\n\nYou justicers, that these our nether crimes\n\nSo speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!\n\nLost he his other eye?\n\nMessenger Both, both, my lord.\n\nThis letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;\n\n’Tis from your sister.\n\nGoneril [ aside ] One way I like this well;\n\nBut being widow, and my Gloucester with her,\n\nMay all the building in my fancy pluck\n\nUpon my hateful life: another way,\n\nThe news is not so tart. [ Aloud ] I’ll read, and answer.\n\n[ Exit ]\n\nAlbany Where was his son when they did take his eyes?\n\nMessenger Come with my lady hither.\n\nAlbany He is not here.\n\nMessenger No, my good lord; I met him back again.\n\nAlbany Knows he the wickedness?\n\nMessenger Ay, my good lord; ’twas he informed against him,\n\nAnd quit the house on purpose that their punishment\n\nMight have the freer course.\n\nAlbany Gloucester, I live\n\nTo thank thee for the love thou show’dst the King,\n\nAnd to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:\n\nTell me what more thou know’st.\n\n[ Exeunt ]\n\nScene 3\n\nThe French camp near Dover. Enter  Kent  and a  Gentleman.\n\nKent Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know\n\nyou the reason?\n\nGentleman Something he left imperfect in the state, which\n\nsince his coming forth is thought of; which imports to the\n\nkingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return\n\nwas most required and necessary.\n\nKent Who hath he left behind him general?\n\nGentleman The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.\n\nKent Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration\n\nof grief?\n\nGentleman Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;\n\nAnd now and then an ample tear trilled down\n\nHer delicate cheek; it seemed she was a queen\n\nOver her passion; who, most rebel-like,\n\nSought to be king o’ er her.\n\nKent O, then, it moved her.\n\nGentleman Not to a rage; patience and sorrow strove\n\nWho should express her goodliest. You have seen\n\nSunshine and rain at once; her smiles and tears\n\nWere like, a better way; those happy smilets\n\nThat played on her ripe lip seemed not to know\n\nWhat guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,\n\nAs pearls from diamonds dropped. In brief,\n\nSorrow would be a rarity most beloved,\n\nIf all could so become it.\n\nKent Made she no verbal question?\n\nGentleman Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of\n\n‘father’\n\nPantingly forth, as if it pressed her heart;\n\nCried ‘Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!\n\nKent! father! sisters! What, i’ th’ storm! i’ th’ night?\n\nLet pity not believe it!’ There she shook\n\nThe holy water from her heavenly eyes,\n\nAnd clamour moistened, then away she started\n\nTo deal with grief alone.\n\nKent It is the stars,\n\nThe stars above us, govern our conditions;\n\nElse one self mate and make could not beget\n\nSuch different issues. You spoke not with her since?\n\nGentleman No.\n\nKent Was this before the King returned?\n\nGentleman No, since.\n\nKent Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear’s i’ th’ town;\n\nWho sometime, in his better tune, remembers\n\nWhat we are come about, and by no means\n\nWill yield to see his daughter.\n\nGentleman Why, good sir?\n\nKent A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,\n\nThat stripped her from his benediction, turned her\n\nTo foreign casualties, gave her dear rights\n\nTo his dog-hearted daughters: these things sting\n\nHis mind so venomously that burning shame\n\nDetains him from Cordelia.\n\nGentleman Alack, poor gentleman!\n\nKent Of Albany’s and Cornwall’s powers you heard not?\n\nGentleman ’Tis so, they are afoot.\n\nKent Well, sir, I’ll bring you to our master Lear,\n\nAnd leave you to attend him. Some dear cause\n\nWill in concealment wrap me up awhile;\n\nWhen I am known aright, you shall not grieve\n\nLending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go\n\nAlong with me.\n\n[ Exeunt ]\n\nScene 4\n\nThe same. Enter , with drum and colours , Cordelia, Doctor,  and Soldiers.\n\nCordelia Alack, ’tis he: why, he was met even now\n\nAs mad as the vexed sea; singing aloud;\n\nCrowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,\n\nWith hardocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,\n\nDarnel, and all the idle weeds that grow\n\nIn our sustaining corn. A century send forth;\n\nSearch every acre in the high-grown field,\n\nAnd bring him to our eye. [ Exit an Officer ]\n\nWhat can man’s wisdom\n\nIn the restoring his bereaved sense?\n\nHe that helps him take all my outward worth.\n\nDoctor There is means, madam;\n\nOur foster-nurse of nature is repose,\n\nThe which he lacks; that to provoke in him,\n\nAre many simples operative, whose power\n\nWill close the eye of anguish.\n\nCordelia All blest secrets,\n\nAll you unpublished virtues of the earth,\n\nSpring with my tears! be aidant and remediate\n\nIn the good man’s distress! Seek, seek for him,\n\nLest this ungoverned rage dissolve the life\n\nThat wants the means to lead it.\n\n[ Enter a  Messenger ]\n\nMessenger News, madam;\n\nThe British powers are marching hitherward.\n\nCordelia ’Tis known before; our preparation stands\n\nIn expectation of them. O dear father!\n\nIt is thy business that I go about;\n\nTherefore great France\n\nMy mourning and importuned tears hath pitied.\n\nNo blown ambition doth our arms incite,\n\nBut love, dear love, and our aged father’s right.\n\nSoon may I hear and see him!\n\n[ Exeunt ]\n\nScene 5\n\nGloucester’s castle.

Edmund, I think, is gone,\n\nIn pity of his misery, to dispatch\n\nHis nighted life; moreover, to descry\n\nThe strength o ’th’ enemy.\n\nOswald I needs must after him, madam, with my letter.\n\nRegan Our troops set forth to-morrow; stay with us,\n\nThe ways are dangerous.\n\nOswald I may not, madam;\n\nMy lady charged my duty in this business.\n\nRegan Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you\n\nTransport her purposes by word? Belike,\n\nSomething – I know not what: I’ll love thee much,\n\nLet me unseal the letter.\n\nOswald Madam, I had rather –\n\nRegan I know your lady does not love her husband;\n\nI am sure of that; and at her late being here\n\nShe gave strange eliads and most speaking looks\n\nTo noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.\n\nOswald I, madam!\n\nRegan I speak in understanding: y’are, I know’t:\n\nTherefore I do advise you, take this note:\n\nMy lord is dead; Edmund and I have talked;\n\nAnd more convenient is he for my hand\n\nThan for your lady’s. You may gather more.\n\nIf you do find him, pray you give him this,\n\nAnd when your mistress hears thus much from you,\n\nI pray desire her call her wisdom to her:\n\nSo, fare you well.\n\nIf you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,\n\nPreferment falls on him that cuts him off.\n\nOswald Would I could meet him, madam: I should show\n\nWhat party I do follow.\n\nRegan Fare thee well.\n\n[ Exeunt ]\n\nScene 6\n\nThe country near Dover. Enter  Gloucester,  and  Edgar  dressed like a peasant.\n\nGloucester When shall I come to the top of that same hill?\n\nEdgar You do climb up it now; look how we labour.\n\nGloucester Methinks the ground is even.\n\nEdgar Horrible steep.\n\nHark! Do you hear the sea?\n\nGloucester No, truly.\n\nEdgar Why, then your other senses grow imperfect\n\nBy your eyes’ anguish.\n\nGloucester So may it be, indeed.\n\nMethinks thy voice is altered, and thou speak’st\n\nIn better phrase and matter than thou didst.\n\nEdgar You’re much deceived; in nothing am I changed\n\nBut in my garments.\n\nGloucester Methinks you’re better spoken.\n\nEdgar Come on, sir; here’s the place: stand still. How fearful\n\nAnd dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low!\n\nThe crows and choughs that wing the midway air\n\nShow scarce so gross as beetles; halfway down\n\nHangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!\n\nMethinks he seems no bigger than his head.\n\nThe fishermen that walk upon the beach\n\nAppear like mice, and yond tall anchoring bark\n\nDiminished to her cock; her cock a buoy\n\nAlmost too small for sight. The murmuring surge,\n\nThat on the unnumbered idle pebbles chafes,\n\nCannot be heard so high. I’ll look no more,\n\nLest my brain turn, and the deficient sight\n\nTopple down headlong.\n\nGloucester Set me where you stand.\n\nEdgar Give me your hand; you are now within a foot\n\nOf the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon\n\nWould I not leap upright.\n\nGloucester Let go my hand.\n\nHere, friend, ’s another purse; in it a jewel\n\nWell worth a poor man’s taking: fairies and gods\n\nProsper it with thee! Go thou further off;\n\nBid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.\n\nEdgar Now fare ye well, good sir.\n\nGloucester With all my heart.\n\nEdgar [ aside ] Why I do trifle thus with his despair\n\nIs done to cure it.\n\nGloucester [ kneeling ] O you mighty gods!\n\nThis world I do renounce, and in your sights\n\nShake patiently my great affliction off;\n\nIf I could bear it longer, and not fall\n\nTo quarrel with your great opposeless wills,\n\nMy snuff and loathed part of nature should\n\nBurn itself out. If Edgar live, O bless him!\n\nNow, fellow, fare thee well.\n\n[ He falls forward ]\n\nEdgar Gone, sir: farewell.\n\nAnd yet I know how conceit may rob\n\nThe treasury of life when life itself\n\nYields to the theft; had he been where he thought\n\nBy this had thought been past. Alive or dead?\n\nHo, you sir! Friend! Hear you, sir! Speak!\n\nThus might he pass indeed; yet he revives.\n\nWhat are you, sir?\n\nGloucester Away, and let me die.\n\nEdgar Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,\n\nSo many fathom down precipitating,\n\nThou’ dst shivered like an egg; but thou dost breathe,\n\nHast heavy substance, bleed’ st not, speak’ st, art sound.\n\nTen masts at each make not the altitude\n\nWhich thou hast perpendicularly fell:\n\nThy life’s a miracle. Speak yet again.\n\nGloucester But have I fallen or no?\n\nEdgar From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.\n\nLook up a-height: the shrill-gorged lark so far\n\nCannot be seen or heard: do but look up.\n\nGloucester Alack! I have no eyes.\n\nIs wretchedness deprived that benefit\n\nTo end itself by death? ’Twas yet some comfort,\n\nWhen misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage,\n\nAnd frustrate his proud will.\n\nEdgar Give me your arm:\n\nUp: so; how is’t? Feel you your legs? You stand.\n\nGloucester Too well, too well.\n\nEdgar This is above all strangeness.\n\nUpon the crown o’ th’ cliff what thing was that\n\nWhich parted from you?\n\nGloucester A poor unfortunate beggar.\n\nEdgar As I stood here below, methought his eyes\n\nWere two full moons; he had a thousand noses,\n\nHorns whelked and waved like the enridged sea:\n\nIt was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,\n\nThink that the clearest gods, who make them honours\n\nOf men’s impossibilities, have preserved thee.\n\nGloucester I do remember now; henceforth I’ll bear\n\nAffliction till it do cry out itself\n\n‘Enough, enough,’ and die. That thing you speak of\n\nI took it for a man; often ’twould say\n\n‘The fiend, the fiend’: he led me to that place.\n\nEdgar Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?\n\n[ Enter  Lear,  fantastically dressed with wild flowers ]\n\nThe safer sense will ne’ er accommodate\n\nHis master thus.\n\nLear No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the King\n\nhimself.\n\nEdgar O, thou side-piercing sight!\n\nLear Nature’s above art in that respect. There’s your press-\n\nmoney. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper: draw\n\nme a clothier’s yard. Look, look! a mouse. Peace, peace! This\n\npiece of toasted cheese will do’t. There’s my gauntlet; I’ll\n\nprove it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. Oh, well flown\n\nbird; i’ th’ clouts i’ th’ clout: hewgh! Give the word.\n\nEdgar Sweet marjoram.\n\nLear Pass.\n\nGloucester I know that voice.\n\nLear Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered me\n\nlike a dog, and told me I had the white hairs in my beard ere\n\nthe black ones were there. To say ‘ay’ and ‘no’ to every thing\n\nthat I said! ‘Ay’ and ‘no’ too was no good divinity. When the\n\nrain came to wet me once and the wind to make me chatter,\n\nwhen the thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I\n\nfound ’em, there I smelt ’em out. Go to, they are not men\n\no’ their words: they told me I was every thing; ’tis a lie, I am\n\nnot ague-proof.\n\nGloucester The trick of that voice I do well remember:\n\nIs’t not the King?\n\nLear Ay, every inch a king:\n\nWhen I do stare, see how the subject quakes.\n\nI pardon that man’s life. What was thy cause?\n\nAdultery?\n\nThou shalt not die; die for adultery! No:\n\nThe wren goes to’t, and the small gilded fly\n\nDoes lecher in my sight.\n\nLet copulation thrive; for Gloucester’s bastard son\n\nWas kinder to his father than my daughters\n\nGot ’tween the lawful sheets.\n\nTo’t, luxury, pell-mell! For I lack soldiers.\n\nBehold yond simp’ring dame,\n\nWhose face between her forks presages snow;\n\nThat minces virtue, and does shake the head\n\nTo hear of pleasure’s name;\n\nThe fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to’t\n\nWith a more riotous appetite.\n\nDown from the waist they are Centaurs,\n\nThough women all above:\n\nBut to the girdle do the gods inherit,\n\nBeneath is all the fiends’: there’s hell, there’s darkness,\n\nThere is the sulphurous pit, burning, scalding,\n\nStench, consumption; fie, fie, fie! pah, pah!\n\nGive me an ounce of civet, good apothecary,\n\nTo sweeten my imagination.\n\nThere’s money for thee.\n\nGloucester O, let me kiss that hand.\n\nLear Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.\n\nGloucester O ruined piece of nature! This great world\n\nShall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?\n\nLear I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny\n\nat me?\n\nNo, do thy worst, blind Cupid; I’ll not love.\n\nRead thou this challenge; mark but the penning of it.\n\nGloucester Were all thy letters suns, I could not see.\n\nEdgar [ aside ] I would not take this from report; it is,\n\nAnd my heart breaks at it.\n\nLear Read.\n\nGloucester What, with the case of eyes?\n\nLear O, ho! are you there with me?

If thou’rt noble,\n\nI do forgive thee.\n\nEdgar Let’s exchange charity.\n\nI am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;\n\nIf more, the more thou hast wronged me.\n\nMy name is Edgar, and thy father’s son.\n\nThe gods are just, and of our pleasant vices\n\nMake instruments to plague us;\n\nThe dark and vicious place where thee he got\n\nCost him his eyes.\n\nEdmund Thou hast spoken right, ’tis true.\n\nThe wheel is come full circle; I am here.\n\nAlbany Methought thy very gait did prophesy\n\nA royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:\n\nLet sorrow split my heart, if ever I\n\nDid hate thee or thy father.\n\nEdgar Worthy prince, I know’t.\n\nAlbany Where have you hid yourself?\n\nHow have you known the miseries of your father?\n\nEdgar By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;\n\nAnd when ’tis told, O that my heart would burst!\n\nThe bloody proclamation to escape\n\nThat followed me so near – O, our lives’ sweetness,\n\nThat we the pain of death would hourly die\n\nRather than die at once! – taught me to shift\n\nInto a madman’s rags, assume a semblance\n\nThat very dogs disdained: and in this habit\n\nMet I my father with his bleeding rings,\n\nTheir precious stones new lost; became his guide,\n\nLed him, begged for him, saved him from despair;\n\nNever – O fault! – revealed myself unto him,\n\nUntil some half-hour past, when I was armed;\n\nNot sure, though hoping, of this good success,\n\nI asked his blessing, and from first to last\n\nTold him my pilgrimage: but his flawed heart,\n\nAlack, too weak the conflict to support,\n\n’Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,\n\nBurst smilingly.\n\nEdmund This speech of yours hath moved me,\n\nAnd shall perchance do good; but speak you on;\n\nYou look as you had something more to say.\n\nAlbany If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;\n\nFor I am almost ready to dissolve,\n\nHearing of this.\n\nEdgar This would have seemed a period\n\nTo such as love not sorrow; but another,\n\nTo amplify too much, would make much more,\n\nAnd top extremity.\n\nWhilst I was big in clamour, came there in a man,\n\nWho, having seen me in my worst estate,\n\nShunned my abhorred society; but then, finding\n\nWho ’twas that so endured, with his strong arms\n\nHe fastened on my neck, and bellowed out\n\nAs he’ Id burst heaven; threw him on my father;\n\nTold the most piteous tale of Lear and him\n\nThat ever ear received; which in recounting\n\nHis grief grew puissant, and the strings of life\n\nBegan to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,\n\nAnd there I left him tranced.\n\nAlbany But who was this?\n\nEdgar Kent, sir, the banished Kent; who in disguise\n\nFollowed his enemy king, and did him service\n\nImproper for a slave.\n\n[ Enter a  Gentleman,  with a bloody knife ]\n\nGentleman Help, help! O, help!\n\nEdgar What kind of help?\n\nAlbany Speak, man.\n\nEdgar What means this bloody knife?\n\nGentleman ’Tis hot, it smokes;\n\nIt came even from the heart of – O, she’s dead!\n\nAlbany Who dead? Speak, man.\n\nGentleman Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister\n\nBy her is poisoned; she confesses it.\n\nEdmund I was contracted to them both: all three\n\nNow marry in an instant.\n\nEdgar Here comes Kent.\n\n[ Enter  Kent ]\n\nAlbany Produce the bodies, be they alive or dead;\n\n[ Exit  Gentleman ]\n\nThis judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,\n\nTouches us not with pity.

And where’s Cordelia?\n\n[ The bodies of  Goneril  and  Regan  are brought in ]\n\nSeest thou this object, Kent?\n\nKent Alack, why thus?\n\nEdmund Yet Edmund was beloved;\n\nThe one the other poisoned for my sake,\n\nAnd after slew herself.\n\nAlbany Even so. Cover their faces.\n\nEdmund I pant for life; some good I mean to do\n\nDespite of mine own nature. Quickly send,\n\nBe brief in it, to th’ castle; for my writ\n\nIs on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.\n\nNay, send in time.\n\nAlbany Run, run! O, run!\n\nEdgar To who, my lord? Who has the office?

Enter the  Earl of Kent, followed by the Earl of Gloucester  and his illegitimate son  Edmund.  They are discussing court matters.\n\nKent I thought the King favored the Duke of Albany more\n\nthan the Duke of Cornwall.\n\nGloucester It always seemed so to us. But now that he has\n\ndivided up his kingdom, it isn’t clear which of the Dukes he\n\nvalues more. Their shares are so equal that neither is to be\n\npreferred to the other.\n\nKent [ indicating  Edmund ] Isn’t this your son, my lord?\n\nGloucester I fathered him, sir. I’ve so often been\n\nembarrassed to admit he’s mine that now I’m hardened\n\nto it.\n\nKent I cannot conceive why.\n\nGloucester Sir, this young fellow’s mother could! So she got\n\npregnant, and had a son for her cradle before she had a\n\nhusband for her bed. Do you detect a fault?\n\nKent I can’t wish the fault undone, the result of it being so\n\nhandsome!\n\nGloucester But I have a legitimate son, sir, about a year older\n\nthan this one, though I don’t make any distinction in his\n\nfavor. [ nodding toward  Edmund ] Though this fellow was\n\ncheeky enough to be born before he was sent for, there’s no\n\ndenying his mother was beautiful. We had a good time\n\nbegetting him, so the rascal can’t be disowned. Do you\n\nknow this noble gentleman, Edmund?\n\nEdmund No, my lord.\n\nGloucester [ introducing him formally ] The Lord of Kent.\n\nRegard him always as my honorable friend.\n\nEdmund [ bowing ] At your service, my lord.\n\nKent My love to you: I’d like to know you better.\n\nEdmund Sir, I’ll try to be worthy of your interest.\n\nGloucester He’s been soldiering abroad these last nine years,\n\nand he’ll be off again soon. [ The sound of trumpets is heard ]\n\nThe King is coming.\n\n[ A servant enters carrying a coronet, followed by  King Lear;\n\nthe Dukes of  Albany  and  Cornwall;  their wives  Goneril  and\n\nRegan,  two daughters of the King;  Cordelia,  Lear’s youngest\n\ndaughter; and members of the court. ]\n\nLear Bring in the Lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.\n\nGloucester I shall, my liege. [ He goes, followed by  Edmund ]\n\nLear Meanwhile we’ll reveal our plan. Give me that map,\n\nthere. [ Servants  hand him a large map of Britain. He\n\naddresses the court ] Be it known that we have divided our\n\nkingdom into three parts; and it is our firm intention to\n\nshake off all cares and responsibilities in our old age, and to\n\nconfer them on younger shoulders while we, freed of our\n\nburdens, crawl toward death. Our son-in-law Cornwall, and\n\nyou, our no less loving son-in-law Albany: we have resolved\n\nat this juncture to make public the various doweries of our\n\ndaughters, so that future strife can be prevented now. The\n\nKing of France and the Duke of Burgundy – keen rivals for\n\nthe hand of our youngest daughter – have for a long time\n\nresided at our court as suitors, and they are to have their\n\nanswer here. [ To  Goneril, Regan  and  Cordelia ] Tell me, my\n\ndaughters – since we shall now divest us of our throne, our\n\nterritorial possessions and our administrative\n\nresponsibilities – which of you shall we say is the one who\n\nloves us most? Then we can bestow our greatest generosity\n\nwhere natural affection most merits it. Goneril, our eldest\n\nchild, speak first.\n\nGoneril Sir, I love you more than words can express: dearer\n\nthan eyesight, freedom or independence; more than what is\n\nutterly priceless or rare; no less than life itself when it has\n\ndignity, health, beauty and honor; as much as a child ever\n\nloved or a father ever enjoyed affection; a love that makes\n\nwords weak and speech inadequate. Beyond all such\n\ncomparisons I love you.\n\nCordelia [ aside ] What shall Cordelia say? Just love, and be\n\nsilent …\n\nLear [ indicating the boundaries of  Goneril’s  legacy on the\n\nmap ] All this region – from this line here to this – rich with\n\nshady forests, fertile plains, teeming rivers and broad\n\nmeadows, we give you to rule. This is for you and your\n\nhusband Albany’s descendants forever. [ He turns to  Regan ]\n\nWhat has our second daughter to say, our dearest Regan,\n\nwife of the Duke of Cornwall? Speak.\n\nRegan I am made of the same metal as my sister, so value\n\nme as you have done her. From the bottom of my heart, I\n\nfind she describes my own love precisely, except that she\n\nunderstates it. No other pleasure appeals to me: my\n\nhappiness is solely in the enjoyment of your love.\n\nCordelia [ to herself ] Poor Cordelia, then! But not really so,\n\nbecause I’m sure my love is greater than my tongue can\n\nexpress.\n\nLear [ to  Regan ] To you and yours, in perpetuity, is bestowed\n\nthis extensive third of our fine kingdom: no smaller, less\n\nvaluable or pleasurable than that conferred on Goneril.\n\n[ Turning to  Cordelia ] Now our joy; last-born but not least; for\n\nwhose young love the vineyards of France and the pastures\n\nof Burgundy compete: What can you say to attract a third\n\nshare more valuable than that of your sisters? Speak.\n\nCordelia Nothing, my lord.\n\nLear Nothing?\n\nCordelia Nothing.\n\nLear Nothing begets nothing. Speak again.\n\nCordelia Wretched as I am, I can’t express in words what’s in\n\nmy heart. I love your Majesty according to my duty as a\n\ndaughter. No more, no less.\n\nLear [ his anger rising ] What, what Cordelia? Speak more\n\ntactfully, lest you spoil your chances!\n\nCordelia My good lord, you have fathered me, brought me up\n\nand loved me. I return those duties accordingly: I obey you,\n\nlove you, and honor you most. Why have my sisters got\n\nhusbands, if they say they love you absolutely? Be assured\n\nthat when I wed, the man who has my hand in marriage will\n\nhave half my love, half my care and duty. Certainly I’ll never\n\nmarry like my sisters, loving my father so totally.\n\nLear Is this spoken from the heart?\n\nCordelia Yes, my good lord.\n\nLear So young, yet so hard-hearted?\n\nCordelia So young, my lord, and truthful.\n\nLear Right, then: truth shall be your dowry! By the sun’s\n\nsacred beams, by the witch-queen’s magic rites at night, by\n\nall the stars that govern life and death: I here disclaim my\n\nfatherly affection, my kinship, my blood relationship! For\n\nevermore I shall regard you as a stranger to my heart and\n\nme. Barbarians like the Scythians, or those who eat their\n\nprogeny when they’re hungry, shall be as welcomed, pitied\n\nand given succor as you, my former daughter!\n\nKent Your Majesty –\n\nLear Silence, Kent! Don’t come between the dragon and the\n\nobject of his wrath! I loved her most, and planned to live\n\nwith her in my retirement. Go, get out of my sight! Death is\n\nmy only consolation, since here I give away a father’s love!\n\nCall the King of France. Quick now! Call Burgundy! Cornwall\n\nand Albany, to my two daughters’ dowries add this third\n\n[ pointing to  Cordelia’s  territory on the map ]. Let\n\npride – which she calls frankness – get her a husband. I\n\ninvest you jointly with my power, my absolute authority, and\n\nall the ceremony that goes with kingship. We shall live with\n\nyou alternately on a monthly basis, retaining the right to\n\nhave a hundred knights maintained at your expense. We’ll\n\nsimply retain the title and all the honors and prerogatives\n\ndue to a king. Policy, taxation, and all administrative\n\nmatters, beloved sons, will be yours. In confirmation, this\n\ncoronet is divided between you. [ The  Servant  presents it to\n\nthe  Dukes ]\n\nKent Royal Lear, whom I’ve always honored as my King,\n\nloved as if he were my father, followed as he is my master,\n\nmentioned in my prayers as my great patron –\n\nLear The bow is bent and drawn: keep clear of the arrow!\n\nKent Better to let it go, even though it pierces my heart! Kent\n\nmust be discourteous when Lear is mad. What are you\n\ndoing, old man? Do you think loyal men will fear to speak\n\nwhen those in power fall for flattery? Honor demands plain\n\nspeaking when kings descend to folly. Keep your kingdom,\n\nand think again; let this appalling rashness go no further. I’ll\n\nstake my life on it: your youngest daughter does not love\n\nyou least, nor are they heartless whose low-key speeches\n\ncontain no flattery.\n\nLear Kent, on your life, no more!\n\nKent I never considered my life as more than a mere pawn, to\n\nbe used against your enemies, nor do I fear losing it when\n\nyour safety is the issue.\n\nLear Out of my sight!\n\nKent See better, Lear, and let me – as ever – be clear-sighted\n\non your behalf!\n\nLear Now, by Apollo – !\n\nKent Now, by Apollo, King, you invoke your gods in vain!\n\nLear Oh, you ruffian! Infidel! [ He puts his hand to his sword ]\n\nAlb., Corn. Good sir, be patient!\n\nKent Kill your doctor and give the fee to the foul\n\ndisease! Withdraw your gift, or while I’ve still got breath to\n\nprotest, I’ll tell you that you’re doing wrong!\n\nLear Listen, traitor! On your oath of allegiance, hear me!\n\nSince you have tried to make us break our vow, which we\n\nhave never done before, and because, with excessive pride,\n\nyou’ve attempted to come between our sentence and our\n\nauthority – which, neither our character nor our rank can\n\ntolerate – to confirm our power, take your reward! We give\n\nyou five days to prepare yourself for the rigors of the world.\n\nOn the sixth, turn your hated back upon our kingdom. If on\n\nthe tenth day after that your banished body is to be found\n\nin our realm, that moment is your death. Away! By Jupiter,\n\nthis will not be revoked!\n\nKent Farewell, King. Since that’s how you want it, freedom\n\nlives abroad, and banishment is here. [ To  Cordelia ] The gods\n\nprotect you, maid. Your reasoning’s right and you’ve said\n\nwhat’s true. [ To  Goneril  and  Regan ] As for your grandiose\n\nspeeches, may your deeds live up to them! Then some good\n\nmight come from loving words. [ To the assembled nobles ]\n\nThus, Princes, Kent bids you all farewell. He’ll continue to\n\nbe his old self in a new country.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\n[ A flourish of trumpets heralds the entry of  Gloucester,  the\n\nKing of France,  the  Duke of Burgundy,  and their Attendants ]\n\nGloucester Here are France and Burgundy, my lord.\n\nLear My Lord of Burgundy: we address you first. You have\n\ncompeted with this king for our daughter’s hand. What is\n\nthe minimum dowry you will require with her, without which\n\nyou’d cease to be a suitor?\n\nBurgundy Most royal Majesty: I beg no more than your\n\nHighness has offered. Surely you would not suggest less?\n\nLear Right noble Burgundy, when we loved her, we valued\n\nher accordingly. Now her price has fallen. Sir, there she\n\nstands. If anything in particular about that outspoken object,\n\nor all of it – complete with our displeasure, and nothing\n\nmore – happens to suit your Grace, she’s there, and she is\n\nyours.\n\nBurgundy I don’t know what to say.\n\nLear Will you – with all her imperfections: friendless; our\n\nhatred freshly upon her; her dowry our curse; disowned by\n\nour vow – take her or leave her?\n\nBurgundy With respect, royal sir, decisions are not made on\n\nterms like those.\n\nLear Then leave her, sir, because by the gods that made me,\n\nI’m telling you that’s all she’s worth. [ To  France ] As for you,\n\ngreat King, I would not distance myself from your love by\n\nmarrying you to one I hate. Therefore I entreat you to turn\n\nyour affections in a worthier direction than on a wretch who\n\nbehaves so unnaturally.\n\nFrance It’s very strange that she – who just now was your\n\nmost precious possession, the subject of your praise, the\n\ncomfort of your old age, the best, the dearest – should\n\nsuddenly commit something so monstrous as to destroy\n\nsuch deep affection. Either her offense must be atrociously\n\nunnatural, or else your former vows of love are suspect.\n\nShort of a miraculous revelation, my reason would never\n\nallow me to believe that of her.\n\nCordelia I appeal to your Majesty – in spite of lacking the glib\n\nand oily art of making empty promises, preferring action\n\nrather than words – to state publicly that it is no vicious\n\nmisbehavior, murder or wickedness, no wantonness or\n\ndishonorable action, that has deprived me of your grace\n\nand favor. Rather it is for lacking what I’m better off\n\nwithout: an eye for seeking favors, and the kind of tongue\n\nI’m glad I haven’t got, though not having it has ruined me in\n\nyour affection.\n\nLear Better you had never been born than not to have pleased\n\nme better.\n\nFrance Is this all? A natural reticence that often\n\nunintentionally leaves inner thoughts unspoken? My Lord of\n\nBurgundy, what do you say to the lady? Love is not true love\n\nwhen it is subject to irrelevant conditions. Will you have\n\nher? She’s a dowry in herself.\n\nBurgundy [ to  Lear ] Royal King, just give the dowry which you\n\nyourself proposed, and I’ll take Cordelia by the hand –\n\nDuchess of Burgundy.\n\nLear Nothing. I have made a vow. I am resolute.\n\nBurgundy [ to  Cordelia ] Then I am sorry: losing a father has\n\nlost you a husband.\n\nCordelia [ wryly ] God bless Burgundy! Since he’s in love with\n\nrespectability and wealth, I shall not be his wife!\n\nFrance Fairest Cordelia, who is precious, being poor;\n\nmost exquisite, being forsaken; and most loved, being\n\ndespised! You and your virtues I here claim. If it is lawful, I\n\nwill take up what has been cast away. The gods, the gods!\n\nIt’s strange that their cold indifference should ignite my love!\n\nYour dowerless daughter, King, by good fortune mine, is\n\nqueen to me, of all I possess, and of fair France. Not all the\n\ndukes of wishy-washy Burgundy could buy this underrated\n\nbut priceless maid from me. Bid them farewell, Cordelia,\n\nunkind though they are. You lose here to gain more\n\nelsewhere.\n\nLear You’ve got her, France. She’s yours. We have no such\n\ndaughter, nor shall we ever see that face of hers again.\n\nTherefore be gone: without our good wishes, our love, or\n\nour blessing. Come, noble Burgundy!\n\n[ Lear  departs, followed by  Burgundy, Cornwall, Albany,\n\nGloucester  and the Attendants ]\n\nFrance [ to  Cordelia ] Say goodbye to your sisters.\n\nCordelia My father’s precious ones, Cordelia leaves in tears. I\n\nknow you for what you are, but as your sister I am reluctant\n\nto expose you. Love our father well. I entrust him to your\n\nso-called care. However, if I were still in favor, I’d find him\n\nsomewhere better to stay. So farewell to you both.\n\nRegan Don’t tell us what to do!\n\nGoneril Concentrate on pleasing your husband, who took you\n\nas a handout from fortune. You have been less than\n\nobedient, and you well deserve what’s happened to you.\n\nCordelia Time will reveal what deceit conceals.\n\nTricksters get exposed in the end. Good luck to you.\n\nFrance Come, my fair Cordelia.\n\n[ France  and  Cordelia  leave ]\n\nGoneril Sister, I have a lot to say of mutual interest. I think\n\nour father will leave tonight.\n\nRegan That’s for certain – and with you. Next month he’ll\n\nstay with us.\n\nGoneril You see how fickle he can be in his old age. We’ve\n\nseen plenty of examples. He always loved our sister most.\n\nHis poor judgment is very obvious from the way he now\n\ncasts her off.\n\nRegan His age is the trouble. But then he has always lacked\n\nself-control.\n\nGoneril Even in his prime he was hot-headed. So now we\n\nmust expect not only his deep-rooted faults, but also the\n\nwillfulness that comes with feeble and crochety old age.\n\nRegan We’re likely to get more sudden whims like Kent’s\n\nbanishment.\n\nGoneril And there’s the way he rudely took leave of France.\n\nWell then, let’s work together. If our father continues to\n\nexercise power in his condition, his abdication will be a\n\nproblem to us.\n\nRegan We’ll give it some more thought.\n\nGoneril We must strike while the iron is hot.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 2\n\nThe Earl of Gloucester’s castle.  Edmund  enters, carrying a letter.\n\nEdmund Nature, you are my goddess! I obey your laws. Why\n\nshould I be plagued by convention and let the narrow-\n\nmindedness of society keep me from my rights, just because\n\nI’m some twelve or fourteen months younger than my\n\nbrother? Why am I “bastard”? Why inferior? I’m as\n\nwell-proportioned, my mind is as vigorous, my build as\n\nsimilar, as the married lady’s offspring. Why do they brand\n\nus as inferior? With inferiority? Illegitimacy? Inferior,\n\ninferior? What, we – who get sounder constitutions and\n\nmore guts from hot-blooded fornication than goes into the\n\nmaking of a whole tribe of idiots conceived between\n\nbedtime and morning in a dull and tedious marriage bed?\n\nWell, then, legitimate Edgar, I must have your inheritance!\n\nOur father loves the bastard Edmund as much as the\n\nlegitimate Edgar. Fine word, “legitimate”! Well, my\n\nlegitimate, if this letter [ he flourishes it ] works properly, and\n\nmy plan prospers, Edmund the bastard will beat the\n\nlegitimate. I progress; I prosper. Now, gods – stand up for\n\nbastards!\n\n[ His father, the  Earl of Gloucester,  enters, thinking aloud ]\n\nGloucester Kent banished like that! And France has left in\n\nanger! And the King departed tonight, his power limited,\n\nrestricted to a token force! All this done on the spur of the\n\nmoment! [ He notices his son ] Greetings, Edmund. What\n\nnews?\n\nEdmund [ hiding his letter very obviously ] May it please your\n\nlordship, none.\n\nGloucester Why are you trying so hard to hide that letter?\n\nEdmund I’ve no news, my lord.\n\nGloucester What was the document you were reading?\n\nEdmund Nothing, my lord.\n\nGloucester No? Then why the indecent haste to put it into\n\nyour pocket? What’s “nothing” has no such need to hide\n\nitself. Let’s see; come on; if it’s nothing, I won’t need\n\nspectacles.\n\nEdmund I beg you, sir, excuse me: it’s a letter from my\n\nbrother that I haven’t finished reading, and from what I’ve\n\nscanned, I believe it’s not for your eyes.\n\nGloucester Give me the letter, sir!\n\nEdmund I’ll give offense whether I keep it or give it. The\n\ncontents, as far as I can follow them, are objectionable.\n\nGloucester Let’s see, let’s see!\n\nEdmund I hope – to make excuses for my brother – that he\n\nwrote this as a test or trial of my honesty.\n\nGloucester [ reading aloud ] This practice of revering old\n\npeople makes the best years of our lives a misery. It keeps\n\nour legacies from us till we’re too old to enjoy them. I’m\n\nbeginning to feel that oppression by an aged tyrant is stupid\n\nand foolish slavery. It operates not through strength, but\n\nthrough the victim’s willingness to suffer. Come and see\n\nme, so I can explain further. If our father would only sleep\n\ntill I awakened him, you’d enjoy half his income\n\nforever – and be beloved of your brother, Edgar.\n\nHmm! Conspiracy! “Sleep till I awakened him, you’d enjoy\n\nhalf his income …” My son Edgar! Could he have written\n\nthis? Had he a heart and a brain to think it up? When did this\n\ncome to you? Who brought it?\n\nEdmund It wasn’t brought to me, my lord. There’s the\n\ncunning of it. I found it thrown through the window of my\n\nbedroom.\n\nGloucester You recognize the handwriting as your brother’s?\n\nEdmund If the contents were acceptable, my lord, I’d swear it\n\nwas his. But in connection with that [ he indicates the letter ]\n\nI’d prefer to think it wasn’t.\n\nGloucester It is his!\n\nEdmund It’s his writing, my lord, but I hope his heart isn’t in\n\nthe contents.\n\nGloucester Has he ever sounded you out on this business\n\nbefore?\n\nEdmund Never, my lord. But I’ve often heard him maintain it\n\nto be only right that, once sons reach maturity and fathers\n\nare past their prime, the father should be in the custody of\n\nthe son, and the son should manage his affairs.\n\nGloucester Oh, the villain, the villain! That’s exactly what he\n\nsays in the letter! The hated villain! The unnatural,\n\ndetestable, brutish villain! Worse than brutish! Go, sir, find\n\nhim. I’ll arrest him. The detestable villain! Where is he?\n\nEdmund I don’t really know, my lord. If you could contain\n\nyour anger against my brother till you can extract from him a\n\nclearer indication of his intentions, you’d be better advised.\n\nOn the other hand, if you react violently against him,\n\nmistaking his purpose, your own honor will be greatly\n\ndamaged, and his loyalty shaken to the core. I’d stake my\n\nlife on him: he’s written this to test my love for your honor,\n\nand not with dangerous intent.\n\nGloucester Do you think so?\n\nEdmund If your honor thinks it’s a good idea, I’ll place you\n\nwhere you can hear us discuss this, and by hearing for\n\nyourself you can settle your doubts this very evening at the\n\nlatest.\n\nGloucester He can’t be such a monster –\n\nEdmund Nor is he, surely.\n\nGloucester – to his own father, who loves him so tenderly\n\nand entirely! Heaven and earth! Edmund, find him. Get his\n\nconfidence, do. Use your discretion. I’d give my all to be\n\nassured of his innocence.\n\nEdmund I’ll look for him, sir, immediately: work things as best\n\nI can, and report back.\n\nGloucester These recent eclipses of the sun and moon are\n\nbad omens for us. Though human reason can explain such\n\nthings away, nonetheless mankind has to suffer the natural\n\nconsequences. Love cools off. Friendship declines. Brothers\n\nare divided. In cities there are riots; in countries, civil war; in\n\npalaces, treason; and the bond between son and father is\n\nbroken. This villain of mine fits the pattern: there’s son\n\nagainst father. The King goes against his natural instincts:\n\nthere’s father against child. We’ve had the best years:\n\nintrigue, insincerity, treachery and chaos follow us\n\ndistressingly to our graves. Sound out this villain, Edmund;\n\nyou’ll lose nothing by it. Do it discreetly. And the noble and\n\nloyal Kent is banished: his offense, honesty! It’s strange.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nEdmund How typically stupid: when things go wrong, often\n\nthrough our own fault, we blame our troubles on the sun,\n\nmoon and stars! As though we are villains through no choice\n\nof our own; fools by order of heaven; knaves, thieves and\n\ntraitors through the dominance of a planet at our births;\n\ndrunkards, liars and adulterers by compulsion from the stars;\n\nand that all our evil acts come from divine provocation! An\n\nadmirable alibi for lecherous man, to blame his lustful\n\ndisposition on a star! My father tumbled my mother under a\n\nwaning moon and I was born under the Great Bear: so it\n\nfollows that I’m rough and lecherous? Pah! I’d be what I am\n\nhad the most chaste star in the firmament twinkled over my\n\nillegitimacy! Edgar –\n\n[ Edgar  enters ]\n\n– and here he comes, as predictably as the ending of an\n\nold-fashioned play. My role requires deep melancholy – with\n\na sigh like that of a lunatic beggar. [ He assumes a suitably\n\nsolemn face and manner of speech ] Oh, these eclipses are\n\npremonitions of disorder … [ He hums to himself as if deep\n\nin philosophic thought ]\n\nEdgar Greetings, brother Edmund! What’s the big problem on\n\nyour mind?\n\nEdmund I’m thinking, brother, of a prediction I read the other\n\nday about what will follow from these eclipses.\n\nEdgar Do you worry about things like that?\n\nEdmund I assure you that the consequences written about\n\nturn out to be disagreeable: such as unnaturalness between\n\nchild and parent; death, famine and the ending of\n\nlongstanding friendships; disunity in countries; threats and\n\ncurses against King and nobles; unfounded suspicions; the\n\nbanishment of friends; desertion of troops; matrimonial\n\nstrife; and I don’t know what.\n\nEdgar How long have you been a student of astrology?\n\nEdmund When did you last see my father?\n\nEdgar Last night.\n\nEdmund Did you speak to him?\n\nEdgar Yes. Fully two hours.\n\nEdmund Did you part on friendly terms? Did he seem\n\ndispleased by the way he spoke or looked?\n\nEdgar Not at all.\n\nEdmund Try to think how you may have offended him. Do me\n\nthe favor of avoiding him till his temper has cooled. At the\n\nmoment he’s so furious that injury to your person would\n\nhardly cool his anger.\n\nEdgar Some villain has wronged me!\n\nEdmund That’s what I fear. I advise you to keep at a discreet\n\ndistance till he calms down: and as I say, come back with\n\nme to my place, where at an opportune time I’ll let you\n\noverhear what my lord says. Please – go! There’s my key. If\n\nyou do go out, go armed.\n\nEdgar Armed, brother?\n\nEdmund Brother, I advise you for the best. I’d be a liar if I said\n\nthere’s any good will toward you. I’ve told you what I’ve\n\nseen and heard, but toned it down – nothing like the\n\nhorrible reality. Please, go!\n\nEdgar Shall I hear from you soon?\n\nEdmund Leave everything to me. [ Edgar  goes.  Edmund  laughs\n\nout loud ] A credulous father and a noble brother! He’s so\n\nincapable of mischief himself that he suspects none. His\n\nfoolish honesty is no match for my wiles. It’s very simple: if I\n\ncan’t get property through inheritance, I’ll get it by using my\n\nwits. Anything goes that suits my purposes.\n\nScene 3\n\nThe Duke of Albany’s palace. Enter  Goneril  and her steward  Oswald.\n\nGoneril Did my father strike my officer for rebuking his Fool?\n\nOswald Yes, madam.\n\nGoneril He does me wrong by day and night. Not an hour\n\npasses but he commits one flagrant offense or another\n\nthat has us all at loggerheads. I won’t put up with it. His\n\nknights are getting riotous, and he himself scolds us about\n\nevery little thing. When he returns from hunting, I won’t\n\nspeak to him. Say I’m sick. If you’re less dutiful than\n\nformerly, that will be quite all right. I’ll take the\n\nresponsibility.\n\n[ Hunting horns can be heard ]\n\nOswald He’s coming, madam. I can hear him.\n\nGoneril Be as offhand as you like, you and your colleagues. I\n\nwant to make an issue of it. If he doesn’t like it, let him go\n\nto my sister. She and I are of one mind, not to give in to\n\nhim. Silly old man, who wants to be in charge of what he’s\n\ngiven away! Upon my soul, old fools are babies again, and\n\nmust be restrained when they are deluded. Remember what\n\nI’ve said.\n\nOswald I will indeed, madam.\n\nGoneril Be cooler to his knights. Ignore the consequences.\n\nSpread the word among your colleagues. I’ll make capital\n\nout of such incidents; I will, so I can speak out. I’ll write to\n\nmy sister at once to do the same. Prepare for dinner.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 4\n\nAnother room in the palace. Enter  Kent,  in disguise\n\nKent If I can also alter my voice, I may be able to carry out the\n\nworthy purpose which prompted my disguise. Well now,\n\nbanished Kent, if you can serve where you stand\n\ncondemned, it may well be that your master, whom you\n\nlove, will discover you are a dedicated servant.\n\n[ Hunting horns herald the entrance of the  King  and his\n\nKnights ]\n\nLear [ to his  Servant ] Don’t keep me waiting for dinner! Go\n\nand get it ready. [ The  Servant  goes ] Well now, who are you?\n\nKent A man, sir.\n\nLear What’s your profession? What’s your business with us?\n\nKent I profess to be no less than I appear to be; to serve any\n\nman loyally who’ll trust me; to love the man who is honest;\n\nto consort with the man who is wise but says little; to fear\n\nbeing judged; to fight when I have no alternative; and to eat\n\nno fish.\n\nLear What are you?\n\nKent A very genuine fellow, and as poor as the King.\n\nLear If you are as poor a subject as he is a King, that’s pretty\n\npoor! What are you seeking?\n\nKent Employment.\n\nLear With whom?\n\nKent You.\n\nLear Do you know me, man?\n\nKent No, sir, but there’s something in your bearing that I\n\nrespect.\n\nLear What’s that?\n\nKent Authority.\n\nLear What services can you perform?\n\nKent I can keep a secret; ride; run; spoil a good story in the\n\ntelling of it; and deliver a simple message bluntly. What\n\nordinary men are fit for, I’m good at. My best quality is\n\ndetermination.\n\nLear How old are you?\n\nKent Not so young, sir, that I’d love a woman for singing, nor\n\nso old as to dote on her for anything. I’m forty-eight.\n\nLear Follow me. You can be my servant. If I like you no less\n\nafter dinner, I’ll take you on permanently. Dinner! hey there!\n\nDinner! Where’s my knave? My Fool? [ To an Attendant ] Go\n\nand fetch my Fool.\n\n[ The Attendant leaves.  Oswald  enters ]\n\nYou. You, fellow. Where’s my daughter?\n\nOswald [ brushing past him ] Excuse me – [ he goes ]\n\nLear What did the fellow say? Call the blockhead back! [ A\n\nKnight  goes in pursuit ] Where’s my Fool, eh? I think the\n\nworld’s asleep. [ The  Knight  returns alone ] Well, where’s\n\nthat mongrel?\n\nKnight He says, my lord, that your daughter isn’t well.\n\nLear Why didn’t the slave come back to me when I called\n\nhim?\n\nKnight Sir, he answered in the rudest manner that he would\n\nnot.\n\nLear He would not?\n\nKnight My lord, I don’t know why, but in my opinion your\n\nHighness is not being treated with the same respectful\n\nceremony as you are used to. There’s a distinct unfriend-\n\nliness among the staff, as well as in the Duke himself and\n\nyour daughter.\n\nLear Hm? Do you think so?\n\nKnight Please forgive me, my lord, if I’m mistaken. My\n\nduty won’t allow me to be silent when I think your Highness\n\nis being wronged.\n\nLear You are only reminding me of what I’ve noticed myself. I\n\nhave observed a hint of neglect lately. I’d put it down to my\n\nown jealous sensitivity rather than a deliberate intention to\n\nbe uncivil. I’ll look further into it. But where’s my Fool? I\n\nhaven’t seen him these last two days.\n\nKnight Since my young lady went to France, sir, the Fool has\n\npined away considerably.\n\nLear Enough of that. I’ve taken good note of it. [ To an\n\nAttendant ] Go and tell my daughter I want to speak to her.\n\n[ The Attendant leaves ] You [ to another ], go and bring my\n\nFool here. [ The Attendant goes ]\n\n[ Oswald  enters ]\n\nOh, you, sir. You. Come here, sir. Who am I, sir?\n\nOswald My lady’s father.\n\nLear “My lady’s father”! My lord’s lackey, you lousy dog!\n\nYou wretch! You cur!\n\nOswald I am none of these, my lord; I beg your pardon.\n\nLear Do you exchange looks with me, you rascal? [ He strikes\n\nOswald  angrily ]\n\nOswald I won’t be struck, my lord.\n\nKent Or tripped, either, you contemptible lout? [ Oswald  falls\n\nto the ground ]\n\nLear Thank you, fellow. You’re my servant, and I’ll take care\n\nof you.\n\nKent [ to  Oswald ] Come on, sir, get up and go! I’ll teach you\n\nyour place! Be off with you: go! If you want to be stretched\n\nout full length again, stay. But away with you! Use your\n\ncommon sense. [ Oswald  runs off ] That’s right.\n\nLear Now, my friendly fellow, thank you: there’s something\n\non account. [ He gives  Kent  some money ]\n\n[ The  Fool  enters ]\n\nFool Let me hire him too: here’s my coxcomb. [ He offers  Kent\n\nhis jester’s cap, which resembles a cock’s comb in shape\n\nand color ]\n\nLear Hello, there, my pretty fellow! How have you been?\n\nFool Sir, you had better have my coxcomb.\n\nKent Why, Fool?\n\nFool Why? For siding with someone who’s out of favor. No,\n\nif you can’t side with the winners, you’ll be in trouble\n\nshortly. So there: take my coxcomb. Why, this fellow\n\n[ indicating  Lear ] has alienated two of his daughters and\n\ndone the third one a blessing without intending to. If you\n\njoin his service, you’ll have to wear my coxcomb. [ To  Lear ]\n\nGreetings, uncle. I wish I had two coxcombs and two\n\ndaughters.\n\nLear Why, my boy?\n\nFool If I gave them all my possessions, I’d keep my coxcombs\n\nfor myself. [ He offers his cap to  Lear ] There’s mine. Beg the\n\nsecond off your daughters.\n\nLear Watch it, now: you’ll be whipped!\n\nFool Truth is a dog that’s sent to his kennel. He gets whipped,\n\nwhereas flattery, the hound bitch, is allowed to stand in\n\nfront of the fire, and stink.\n\nLear [ brooding ] It’s quite insufferable!\n\nFool Sir, I’ll tell you something.\n\nLear Do.\n\nFool Listen carefully, uncle:\n\nOwn more than you show,\n\nDon’t tell all you know,\n\nLend less than you’ve got,\n\nRide more than you trot,\n\nDon’t believe all you’re told,\n\nDon’t risk all your gold;\n\nGive up drink and your whores,\n\nDon’t stray out of doors,\n\nAnd you will have more\n\nThan two tens to the score.\n\nKent This is a lot of nothing, Fool.\n\nFool Then it’s like the advice of a lawyer working without\n\na fee: you get it for nothing. Can’t you make use of nothing,\n\nuncle?\n\nLear Why no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing.\n\nFool [ to  Kent ] Do me a favor. Tell him that’s what his\n\nincome amounts to. He won’t believe a Fool.\n\nLear A bitter Fool!\n\nFool [ to  Lear ] Do you know the difference, my boy, between a\n\nbitter Fool and a sweet one?\n\nLear No, lad, tell me.\n\nFool Whoever counselled you\n\nTo give away your land,\n\nCome place him here by me,\n\nWhile you for him there stand:\n\nThe sweet and bitter fool\n\nWill instantly appear;\n\nThe one in motley here –\n\nThe other standing there!\n\n[ He points to  Lear  as the bitter one ]\n\nLear Are you calling me a fool, boy?\n\nFool All your other titles you have given away. That one you\n\nwere born with.\n\nKent He’s not all fool, my lord.\n\nFool No, indeed. Lords and great men won’t let me be. If I\n\nhad the monopoly, they’d want their share of the profits.\n\nAnd ladies, too: they wouldn’t let me monopolize fooling;\n\nthey’d be snatching. Uncle, give me an egg, and I’ll give you\n\ntwo crowns.\n\nLear What two crowns would they be?\n\nFool Why, after I’d cut the egg down the middle, and eaten\n\nthe yolk, the two halves of the eggshell! When you chopped\n\nyour crown in two and gave both parts away, you were like\n\nthe man in the fable who carried his ass on his back over the\n\nmire. You had little common sense in that bald crown of\n\nyours when you gave your golden one away. If I’m speaking\n\nlike a fool, whip the man who’s responsible. [ He sings ]\n\nFools have never fared so ill\n\n’Cos wise men have turned dopey,\n\nFools don’t know how to sell their skill,\n\nWhen it’s not hard to copy.\n\nLear Since when have you been so full of songs, eh?\n\nFool I’ve been in the mood, uncle, ever since you made your\n\ndaughters your mothers. When you gave them a cane and\n\ndropped your trousers [ he sings ]\n\nThey suddenly both wept for joy,\n\nAnd I in sorrow sang,\n\nThat such a King should play the dunce,\n\nAnd join the foolish gang.\n\nPlease, uncle, employ a schoolmaster to teach your Fool\n\nhow to lie. I’d like to learn how to lie.\n\nLear If you lie, laddie, we’ll have you whipped.\n\nFool I can’t make out the relationship between you and your\n\ndaughters. They’ll have me whipped for speaking the truth;\n\nyou’ll have me whipped for lying. Sometimes I’m whipped\n\nfor saying nothing at all. I’d rather be anything at all than a\n\nFool. But I wouldn’t be you, uncle. You have sliced your\n\nbrains in two and left nothing in the middle. Here comes one\n\nof the halves.\n\n[ Goneril  enters ]\n\nLear Well, now, daughter. Why the face? You frown too\n\nmuch lately.\n\nFool You were a lucky fellow when you didn’t need to care\n\nabout her frowning. Now you are a nonentity. I’m better\n\nthan you are now. I’m a Fool. You are nothing. [ To  Goneril ]\n\nYes indeed. I’ll hold my tongue. That’s what your face is\n\nsaying, though you haven’t spoken.\n\nHush, hush:\n\nThe man who gives away his all,\n\nMay find his kindness turns to gall.\n\n[ Pointing to  Lear ] He’s an empty pea-pod.\n\nGoneril Not merely, sir, your free-speaking Fool, but others\n\namong your insolent followers are bickering and\n\nquarreling hour by hour, erupting into gross and intolerable\n\nrioting. Sir, I thought that by bringing this to your notice I’d\n\nget things put right. Now I’m beginning to fear, from what\n\nyou yourself all too recently have said and done, that you\n\nare covering up this behavior, and encouraging it by your\n\ntolerance. If this is the case, the offense would not go\n\nuncriticized. Nor would disciplinary measures for the good of\n\nsociety be slow in coming: much as they’ll offend you, and\n\nmight in other circumstances seem humiliating, if it were\n\nnot that necessity justified them.\n\nFool ‘Cos you know, uncle:\n\nThe hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo for so long\n\nThat it had its head bitten off by its young.\n\nSo out went the light and we were in darkness!\n\nLear [ to  Goneril ] Are you really our daughter?\n\nGoneril I wish you would use your common sense, which I\n\nknow you possess, and that you’d cast off these\n\ntemperamental moods which recently have changed your\n\npersonality.\n\nFool Can’t a fool tell when the cart draws the horse? Gee-up,\n\nJoan! I love you!\n\nLear Does anyone here recognize me? This can’t be Lear.\n\nDoes Lear walk like this? Speak like this? Where are his\n\neyes? Either his brain is getting weak or his senses are\n\nsluggish. What, awake? It can’t be so. Is there anyone\n\nhere who can tell me who I am?\n\nFool [ aside ] Lear’s shadow …\n\nLear [ not heeding the comment ] I’d really like to know,\n\nbecause from the evidence of sanity, knowledge and reason\n\nI’d be misled into believing I had daughters.\n\nFool Who will make you into an obedient father.\n\nLear [ to  Goneril  with heavy sarcasm ] Your name, fair lady?\n\nGoneril This play-acting, sir, is much in line with these other\n\nnew pranks of yours. I want you to understand me clearly.\n\nAs you are old and respected, you should be wise. Here you\n\nkeep a hundred knights and squires, men so disorderly, so\n\ndebauched and insolent, that our court – influenced by their\n\nconduct – resembles a rowdy inn. Luxurious living and\n\npleasure-seeking make it more like a tavern or a brothel than\n\na respectable palace. It’s so shameful as to demand instant\n\nredress. Therefore, be requested by one who’ll otherwise\n\ntake what she’s politely asking for: reduce the size of your\n\nretinue somewhat, and keep as your remaining attendants\n\nmen appropriate to your age, who can control themselves\n\nand you.\n\nLear Hell and damnation! Saddle my horses! Call my troop\n\ntogether! [ To  Goneril ] You misbegotten bastard! I won’t\n\ntrouble you. I still have one daughter left!\n\nGoneril You strike my servants, and your rowdy rabble order\n\ntheir betters around.\n\n[ Albany  enters ]\n\nLear Woe to him who repents too late! [ To  Albany ] Oh, sir, so\n\nyou’re here. Is this your doing? Answer me, sir! [ To his\n\nServants ] Get my horses ready. Oh, ingratitude! You’re a\n\nfiend with a heart of stone, more hideous than any monster\n\nof the sea when you reveal yourself in a child.\n\nAlbany Really, sir, compose yourself!\n\nLear [ to  Goneril ] Vulture! You tell lies. My troops are men of\n\nrare distinction, who know their duties, and are meticulous\n\nin living up to their honorable reputations. Oh, how a\n\nrelatively small defect seemed repugnant in Cordelia! It\n\nwrenched me apart as if I were on the rack, drew all my love\n\nfrom my heart, and generated bitterness. Oh, Lear, Lear,\n\nLear! [ He slaps his forehead in despair ] Knock at this door\n\nthat let your folly in, and your discretion out! [ Gesturing to\n\nhis followers ] Go, go, my people. [ Kent  and the Knights\n\nleave ]\n\nAlbany My lord, I am as guiltless as I am ignorant of what has\n\nupset you.\n\nLear Possibly so, my lord. [ He turns again to  Goneril ] Hear,\n\nNature, hear! Dear goddess, hear! If you intended her to be\n\nfertile, change your mind! Make her sterile! Dry up her\n\nwomb, and may her despicable body never honor her with\n\na baby! If she must breed, make her child all malice, so it will\n\nlive to be a peevish, cold-hearted torment to her! May it put\n\nwrinkles in her young brow; may tears cut channels in her\n\ncheeks; all her maternal care turn into mockery and\n\ncontempt, so that she realizes how sharper than a serpent’s\n\ntooth it is to have a thankless child! Let’s away, away …\n\n[ He rushes off, overcome with emotion ]\n\nAlbany Now by all the gods, what started that?\n\nGoneril Don’t bother yourself to find out. Let his old age have\n\nits fling.\n\n[ Lear  returns ]\n\nLear What, fifty of my followers at a stroke? Within a\n\nfortnight?\n\nAlbany What do you mean, sir?\n\nLear I’ll tell you. [ To  Goneril ] Life and death! I am ashamed\n\nthat you can shake my manly dignity like this, as though you\n\nare worthy of these hot tears that burst from me. Storms\n\nand fogs upon you! May the deep wounds of a father’s\n\ncurse pierce all your senses! Foolish old eyes, if you persist\n\nin weeping, I’ll pluck you out, and trample you and your\n\ntears into the ground. Has it really come to this? Right. So\n\nbe it. I have another daughter who I’m sure is kind and\n\ncomforting. When she hears about you, she’ll scratch your\n\nwolvish face with her nails. You’ll discover that I’ll resume\n\nthe role that you think I’ve cast off forever.\n\n[ He staggers off, overwhelmed ]\n\nGoneril Did you note that?\n\nAlbany For all the great love I have for you, Goneril, I can’t be\n\nso biased as –\n\nGoneril [ stopping him ] That’s enough. [ Calling ] Oswald there!\n\n[ To the  Fool ] You, sir – more rascal than fool – be off after\n\nyour master.\n\nFool Uncle Lear, Uncle Lear! Hold on, take the Fool with you!\n\nA fox, when one has caught her,\n\nAnd such a daughter,\n\nShould surely go for slaughter,\n\nIf my cap would buy a halter.\n\nSo the Fool chases after …\n\n[ He runs off in pursuit of  Lear ]\n\nGoneril This man [ she means her father ] has been well\n\nadvised. A hundred knights! [ Sarcastically ] It’s sensible and\n\nsafe to let him keep a hundred fully armed knights! Yes – so\n\nthat after every wild dream, each rumor, each fantasy,\n\neach complaint or dislike, he can back up his senile ways\n\nwith their power, and put our lives in jeopardy. Oswald,\n\nI say!\n\nAlbany Well, you may be worrying too much.\n\nGoneril That’s safer than trusting too much. I’d rather\n\neliminate the dangers that worry me than live continually in\n\nfear. I know his character. I’ve written to my sister reporting\n\nwhat he has said. If she accommodates him and his hundred\n\nknights after I’ve explained the undesirability –\n\n[ Oswald  returns ]\n\nWell, Oswald: have you written that letter to my sister?\n\nOswald Yes, madam.\n\nGoneril Take some companions with you and ride off. Inform\n\nher fully of my personal fear. Add such reasons of your own\n\nas may make it more convincing. Be off with you and return\n\nquickly.\n\n[ Oswald  goes ]\n\nThis very tolerant attitude of yours, my lord, though I don’t\n\ncondemn it, yet – if I may say so – you are much more\n\ncriticized for your naivety than praised for your dangerous\n\nleniency.\n\nAlbany How far you are right I don’t know. Sometimes things\n\nare best left alone.\n\nGoneril So –\n\nAlbany Well, well. Let’s see how things develop.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 5\n\nA room in the Duke of Albany’s palace. Enter  Lear, Kent,  and the  Fool.\n\nLear [ to  Kent ] Go ahead to Gloucester with this letter. Tell my\n\ndaughter only what’s needed to answer questions arising\n\nfrom the letter. If you’re not quick, I’ll be there before you.\n\nKent I will not sleep, my lord, till I’ve delivered your letter.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nFool If a man’s brains were in his heels, wouldn’t they be in\n\ndanger of chilblains?\n\nLear Yes, boy.\n\nFool Then cheer up. You’ll never need to wear soft slippers\n\nwith your intelligence.\n\nLear Ha, ha, ha!\n\nFool You’ll see your other daughter will treat you just as\n\nkindly. Because though she’s as like this one [ jerking his\n\nthumb in the direction of  Goneril ] as a crab-apple is to an\n\napple, yet I can tell what I can tell.\n\nLear What can you tell, boy?\n\nFool The taste will be the same. You know why one’s nose is\n\nin the middle of one’s face?\n\nLear No.\n\nFool Why, to keep one’s eyes on either side of one’s nose.\n\nThen what a man can’t smell out, he can look into.\n\nLear I wronged her … [ thinking of  Cordelia ]\n\nFool Do you know how an oyster makes its shell?\n\nLear No.\n\nFool I don’t either. But I can say why a snail has a house.\n\nLear Why?\n\nFool To put his head in, of course, not to give it away to his\n\ndaughters, and leave himself exposed.\n\nLear I’ll forget what’s in my nature. Me, so kind a father! Are\n\nmy horses ready?\n\nFool Your asses are preparing them. The reason why the\n\nPleiades are only seven stars is a good one …\n\nLear Because they aren’t eight?\n\nFool Yes, indeed. You’d make a good Fool!\n\nLear To take it all back again! [ He’s thinking of regaining the\n\nthrone ] Monstrous ingratitude!\n\nFool If you were my Fool, uncle, I’d have you beaten for being\n\nold too soon.\n\nLear How do you mean?\n\nFool You shouldn’t have got old till you’d acquired some\n\nsense.\n\nLear Oh, don’t let me go mad; not mad, sweet heaven! Keep\n\nme sane. I don’t want to be mad!\n\n[ A  Gentleman  enters ]\n\nWell, are the horses ready?\n\nGentleman Ready, my lord.\n\nLear [ to the  Fool ] Come on, boy …\n\nFool [ to the audience ]\n\nThe virgin of today, who laughs at my departure,\n\nWon’t be one much longer, unless something’s cut\n\nshorter.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nAct two\n\nScene 1\n\nInside the castle of the  Earl of Gloucester. Edmund  enters and meets  Curan,  a courtier.\n\nEdmund God be with you, Curan.\n\nCuran And you, sir. I’ve been with your father, and informed\n\nhim that the Duke of Cornwall, and his Duchess Regan, will\n\nbe here with him tonight.\n\nEdmund How has that come about?\n\nCuran I don’t know. You’ve heard the latest? I mean the\n\nrumors, since at the moment they’re only idle gossip.\n\nEdmund No, I haven’t. What are they?\n\nCuran Haven’t you heard of the impending wars between the\n\nDukes of Cornwall and Albany?\n\nEdmund Not a word.\n\nCuran You probably will soon. Fare you well, sir.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nEdmund The Duke coming here tonight! So much the better!\n\nMarvelous! This fits in with my scheme. My father has\n\nhidden himself to overhear my brother and I’ve got some\n\ndelicate business to do. Speed and good fortune, come\n\nto my aid! [ He calls up the adjacent stairs ] Brother, a word\n\nwith you! Come down! Brother, I say!\n\n[ Edgar  descends ]\n\n[ To the audience ] My father is watching. [ Whispering to\n\nEdgar,  and assuming an agitated manner ] Sir, run away!\n\nYour hiding place has been discovered. You have the\n\nadvantage of night cover. Have you not been speaking out\n\nagainst the Duke of Cornwall? He’s coming here now,\n\novernight, in great haste, and Regan is with him. Have you\n\nsaid anything supportive of his case against the Duke of\n\nAlbany? Think hard.\n\nEdgar I’m sure of it. Not a word.\n\nEdmund I can hear my father coming. Excuse me: I must\n\npretend to draw my sword upon you. [ He does so ] Draw\n\nyours. Make as if to defend yourself. [ Edgar,  bewildered,\n\ndoes as he is told ] Do your best. [ Speaking out loud for\n\nGloucester  to hear ] Surrender! Come to my father! Light\n\nthere! [ Whispering ] Run, brother. [ Aloud ] Torches, torches!\n\n[ Pushing  Edgar  out ] So, farewell. [ Edgar  runs off ] Some\n\nblood on me would be convincing evidence of my tough\n\nstruggle. [ He cuts his arm ] I’ve seen drunkards do more than\n\nthis in fun. [ Calling pathetically ] Father, father! [ After  Edgar ]\n\nStop, stop! Will no one help?\n\n[ Gloucester  enters with Servants and torches ]\n\nGloucester Now, Edmund, where’s the villain?\n\nEdmund He was standing here in the dark, his sharp sword\n\ndrawn, mumbling wicked spells, and making incantations to\n\nthe moon to seek her favor.\n\nGloucester But where is he?\n\nEdmund [ playing for time ] Look, sir, I’m bleeding.\n\nGloucester Where is the villain, Edmund?\n\nEdmund [ pointing ] He fled this way, sir, when he was quite\n\nunable –\n\nGloucester Follow him, quick! Go after him! [ Servants rush\n\noff in pursuit ] “Quite unable” to do what?\n\nEdmund Persuade me to murder your lordship. And I told him\n\nthe vengeful gods deal ruthlessly with parricides. I spoke\n\nabout how the bond between father and son was complex\n\nand strong. Sir, in short, seeing how bitterly opposed I was\n\nto his unnatural plan, with a deadly thrust he lunged at my\n\ndefenseless body with his naked sword and wounded my\n\narm. But when he saw my energetic response to the\n\nchallenge, inspired by the justice of the cause – or perhaps\n\naghast at the noise I made – he suddenly ran off.\n\nGloucester No matter how far he goes, there’s nowhere in\n\nthis land where he can stay free. Once found, kill him. The\n\nnoble Duke, my master and chief patron, comes here\n\ntonight. With his authority I’ll announce that whoever finds\n\nhim will be rewarded for bringing the murderous coward to\n\nhis execution. For anyone who hides him, death!\n\nEdmund When I tried to dissuade him from his plan, and\n\nfound he was determined to proceed, with angry words I\n\nthreatened to expose him. He replied, “You poverty-stricken\n\nbastard! Do you think anyone would believe a word you said\n\nif I spoke to the contrary? No. I’d deny it all – indeed I\n\nwould, even if you produced my own handwriting – and say\n\nit was your scheme, plot and treacherous proposal. People\n\nwould have to be very stupid not to see that the profits from\n\nmy death give you an obvious and powerful motive for\n\nseeking it.”\n\nGloucester Oh, that unnatural and confirmed villain! He’d\n\ndeny his letter, did he say? He’s no child of mine.\n\n[ The  Duke of Cornwall’s  trumpet-call is heard ]\n\nListen! The Duke’s trumpets. I don’t know why he’s come.\n\nI’ll block all seaports. The villain won’t escape. The Duke\n\nmust grant me that. Also, I’ll send a picture of him far and\n\nwide so that all the kingdom will take note of him. And I’ll\n\ndevise a way of your inheriting my lands, you loyal and true\n\nson.\n\n[ Cornwall, Regan  and their Attendants enter ]\n\nCornwall Greetings, my noble friend! Since I arrived just\n\nnow, I’ve heard strange news.\n\nRegan If it’s true, no vengeance is adequate in pursuit of the\n\noffender. How are you, my lord?\n\nGloucester Oh, madam, my old heart is broken. It’s broken!\n\nRegan What, did my father’s godson seek your life? The one\n\nmy father named: your Edgar?\n\nGloucester Oh, lady, lady. Shame would have it hidden.\n\nRegan Wasn’t he a companion of the riotous knights who\n\nserved my father?\n\nGloucester I don’t know, madam. It’s too awful. Too awful.\n\nEdmund [ taking his cue from Regan ] Yes, madam, he was one\n\nof that lot.\n\nRegan No wonder, then, that he was so disloyal. They’ve\n\nincited him to plan the old man’s death, so that he can\n\nsquander his wealth. Just this very evening I’ve been told\n\nabout them by my sister, with such warnings that if they\n\ncome to stay at my house, I won’t be there.\n\nCornwall Nor I, Regan, that’s for sure. Edmund, I hear you\n\nhave behaved like a good son to your father.\n\nEdmund It was my duty, sir.\n\nGloucester He revealed Edgar’s plot, and received the wound\n\nyou see while trying to arrest him.\n\nCornwall Is he being pursued?\n\nGloucester Yes, my good lord.\n\nCornwall If he’s captured, never fear his doing harm again.\n\nMake your own plans, using my resources as you please. As\n\nfor you, Edmund, whose virtuous loyalty is so commendable\n\nat this present time, you shall be one of us. Trustworthy\n\nnatures such as yours we have great need of. We seize upon\n\nyour services.\n\nEdmund [ bowing ] I shall serve you truly, sir, whatever else.\n\nGloucester On his behalf I thank your Grace.\n\nCornwall You don’t know why we came to visit you –\n\nRegan – so unexpectedly, traveling through the darkness of\n\nthe night. Business of some importance, Gloucester,\n\nrequiring your advice. Our father has written to us – and so\n\nhas our sister – about certain quarrels. I thought it best to\n\nanswer him away from home. The messengers are waiting\n\nto be dispatched. Our good old friend, be of good cheer, and\n\ngive us your much-needed advice about these matters,\n\nwhich require instant action.\n\nGloucester Your servant, madam. Your Graces are most\n\nwelcome.\n\n[ Trumpets sound as they leave ]\n\nScene 2\n\nOutside Gloucester’s castle.  Kent  and  Oswald  meet. Dawn has not yet broken.\n\nOswald Good morning to you, friend. Are you a servant here?\n\nKent Yes.\n\nOswald Where may we put our horses?\n\nKent In the mud.\n\nOswald Please, if you love me, tell me.\n\nKent I don’t love you.\n\nOswald Well, then, I don’t much care for you.\n\nKent Any more of your lip, and I’ll make you care.\n\nOswald Why the abuse? I don’t know you.\n\nKent I know you, man.\n\nOswald What do you know of me?\n\nKent You’re a rogue, a rascal, a scrap-food guzzler. A low,\n\nproud, shallow, beggarly, scruffy, upstart of a dirty, shabby,\n\ncowardly, officious, mincing rogue. A down-and-out slave.\n\nA man who’d be a pimp to get a good job, and who’s\n\nnothing but a mixture of knave, beggar, coward, procurer,\n\nand the son and heir of a mongrel bitch. A fellow I’ll beat till\n\nhe shrieks if he denies one syllable of what I’ve said!\n\nOswald Why, what a terrible fellow you are, to curse\n\nsomeone who is neither known to you, nor knows you!\n\nKent What a hard-faced rascal you are, to deny you know me!\n\nIs it two days since I tripped you up in front of the King?\n\nDraw your sword, you rogue, ’cos though it may be night,\n\nthe moon’s shining. I’ll pierce you so the moonlight shines\n\nthrough you! [ He draws ] You lousy, rascally phony! Draw!\n\nOswald Go away! I’ll have nothing to do with you!\n\nKent Draw, you rascal! You’re here with letters critical of the\n\nKing, and you side with Lady Stuck-Up against her royal\n\nfather. Draw, you rogue, or I’ll give you a real roasting!\n\nDraw, you rascal! Come on!\n\nOswald Help! Murder! Help!\n\nKent Fight, you coward! Stand your ground, you rogue! You\n\nfoppish coward, fight! [ He beats  Oswald  with the flat of his\n\nsword ]\n\nOswald Help! Murder! Murder!\n\n[ Edmund  enters with his rapier drawn ]\n\nEdmund Hey, what’s all this about? Break!\n\nKent I’ll deal with you, young shaver, if you like! Come on, I’ll\n\nteach you a few things! Come on, laddie! [ He challenges\n\nEdmund  too ]\n\n[ Cornwall  enters, with  Regan, Gloucester  and Servants ]\n\nGloucester Weapons! Fighting! What’s all this?\n\nCornwall No more, upon your lives: the next to strike dies!\n\nWhat’s the matter?\n\nRegan They are the messengers from our sister and the King.\n\nCornwall What’s the quarrel? Speak.\n\nOswald I’m out of breath, my lord.\n\nKent No wonder; your courage was so aroused. You cowardly\n\nrascal, you’re not natural. Some tailor stitched you together.\n\nCornwall You’re an odd fellow. A tailor make a man?\n\nKent Yes, a tailor, sir. A stone-cutter or a painter couldn’t\n\nhave done such a botched job, even if he’d only been\n\nworking for a couple of years.\n\nCornwall So tell me, how did your quarrel start?\n\nOswald This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared on\n\naccount of his grey beard –\n\nKent You useless wretch! You good-for-nothing! My lord,\n\nwith your permission I’ll grind this coarse villain into mortar,\n\nand plaster the wall of a privy with him. Spare my grey\n\nbeard, you dodo bird?\n\nCornwall Quiet, man! You uncouth hooligan: have you no\n\nrespect?\n\nKent Yes, sir. But anger takes precedent.\n\nCornwall Why are you so angry?\n\nKent Because such a wretch as this should display a sword\n\nbut not show any honesty. Smiling rogues such as these\n\noften gnaw like rats through bonds of love that are too tight\n\nto be undone by other means. They satisfy the lusts of their\n\ndebauched masters. They add fuel to anger; they bring chill\n\nto moods of dejection; they deny, affirm, and turn with\n\nthe wind according to their masters’ moods – knowing\n\nnothing but how to follow, like dogs. Damn your twitching\n\nface! Are you laughing at me, as if I were a fool? You goose,\n\nif you were on Salisbury Plain I’d make you cackle your way\n\nback home to Winchester.\n\nCornwall What, are you mad, old fellow?\n\nGloucester How did you come to quarrel? Explain that.\n\nKent No two men hate each other more than I and that rogue.\n\nCornwall Why do you call him a rogue? What has he done\n\nwrong?\n\nKent I don’t like his face.\n\nCornwall Or mine, or his, or hers, probably.\n\nKent Sir, I’m a plain man. I have seen better faces in my time\n\nthan any I see before me now.\n\nCornwall This is a fellow who, having been praised for\n\nbluntness, has assumed a cheeky impertinence; but he\n\nmisuses it. [ Sarcastically ] Oh no, he can’t flatter. Not he!\n\nHe has a plain, honest mind. He has to speak the truth. If\n\npeople will take it, fine. If not, it’s just his way. I know\n\nthese rogues. Behind this bluntness they conceal more\n\ncraftiness, and have corrupter purposes, than twenty\n\ngroveling bootlickers who never put a foot wrong.\n\nKent [ mockingly overpolite ] Sir, in all good faith, in sincere\n\ntruthfulness, with the gracious approval of your mightiness,\n\nwhose power – like the great ball of fire round the sun –\n\nCornwall [ interrupting ] What’s your game?\n\nKent [ reverting to normality ] To change my manner of\n\nspeech, which you disapprove of so much: I know, sir, that\n\nI’m no flatterer. The man who tricked you with plain-\n\nspeaking was a plain rogue. That I’ll never be, even if you\n\nbegged me and I risked your displeasure by turning you\n\ndown.\n\nCornwall [ to  Oswald ] What offense did you give him?\n\nOswald I didn’t give him any. Recently, through a\n\nmisunderstanding, his master the King chose to strike me.\n\nThen, backing his Majesty up and pandering to his anger, he\n\ntripped me from behind. While I was down, he insulted me,\n\nabused me, and made himself out to be such a hero that he\n\ngot credit from it, and was praised by the King for tackling a\n\nman who was offering no aggression. And, inspired by this\n\namazing achievement, he drew on me here again.\n\nKent All rogues and cowards think the noble Ajax is a coward\n\ncompared with them.\n\nCornwall Bring the stocks here! You fierce old rogue, you\n\nelderly braggart! We’ll teach you!\n\nKent Sir, I’m too old to learn. Don’t call your stocks for me. I\n\nserve the King, on whose business I was sent to you. In\n\nstocking his messenger, you would be showing scant\n\nrespect, insulting the King personally, and his office.\n\nCornwall Bring the stocks! Upon my life and honor, he’ll sit\n\nthere till noon.\n\nRegan Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too.\n\nKent Why, madam, if I were your father’s dog you wouldn’t\n\ntreat me like that.\n\nRegan Sir, you being his stooge, I will.\n\nCornwall This is a fellow of the very sort our sister wrote\n\nabout. Come, bring along the stocks.\n\n[ They are carried in ]\n\nGloucester Let me plead with your Grace not to do this. He’s\n\ngreatly at fault, and the good King, his master, will rebuke\n\nhim for it. The undignified punishment you propose is the\n\nsort that the most disreputable and discredited wretches are\n\npunished with, for petty pilfering and minor misdemeanors.\n\nThe King won’t take kindly to having his messenger\n\nshackled like this.\n\nCornwall I’ll answer for that.\n\nRegan My sister might be far more offended, having her\n\nservant abused and assaulted for carrying out her business.\n\nPut his legs in.\n\n[ Kent  is put in the stocks ]\n\nCornwall Let’s go, my lord.\n\n[ All but  Gloucester  and  Kent  leave ]\n\nGloucester I’m sorry for you, friend. It’s the Duke’s whim. As\n\nall the world well knows, his temperament will brook no\n\nrestraint or obstacle. I’ll plead for you.\n\nKent Please don’t, sir. I’ve gone without sleep and traveled a\n\nrough road. I’ll sleep away some of the time; the rest I’ll\n\nwhistle. Even a good man’s fortunes can get down at the\n\nheels. Good day to you!\n\nGloucester The Duke’s at fault in this. It will be taken badly.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nKent Good King, who should have heeded the old proverb:\n\nyou’ve gone from the frying pan into the fire! Come, moon,\n\nso that I can read this letter by your comforting beams!\n\nMiracles are mostly related to misery; I know this is from\n\nCordelia, who fortunately has been informed of my disguise.\n\nShe will find an opportune time to put things right in this\n\nmonstrous state. Take this opportunity, heavy eyes – all\n\nweary and fatigued – not to look upon these shameful\n\nstocks. Good night, Fortune! Smile once more: then turn\n\nyour wheel!\n\n[ He sleeps ]\n\nScene 3\n\nA wood.  Edgar  enters.\n\nEdgar I heard myself proclaimed an outlaw. By hiding in the\n\nconvenient hollow of a tree, I escaped the hunt. No seaport\n\nis free. There’s nowhere that isn’t tightly guarded in order to\n\ncapture me. While I can still escape, I’ll protect myself. I\n\nintend to assume the role of the lowest and poorest man\n\nthat poverty at its most degrading ever dragged down to the\n\nlevel of a beast. I’ll begrime my face with filth, wear a\n\nloin-cloth, matt all my hair in knots, and brave the winds and\n\nsufferings of the elements in the full exposure of my\n\nnakedness. There are many examples around the\n\ncountryside of lunatic beggars who, with roaring voices,\n\nstick pins, wooden skewers, nails and sprigs of rosemary in\n\ntheir cold and numbed bare arms. Using this horrible\n\nspectacle, they extort charity from humble farms, poor\n\npoverty-stricken villages, sheepfarms and mills, sometimes\n\nwith lunatic curses, sometimes with prayers. [ He speaks like\n\na Bedlam beggar ] Poor Turlygod! Poor Tom! [ In his normal\n\nvoice ] There’s that much left for me; as Edgar I’m nothing.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nScene 4\n\nOutside  Gloucester’s  castle.  Kent  is in the stocks.  Lear,  the  Fool  and a  Gentleman  enter.\n\nLear It’s strange that they should leave home like that, and\n\nnot send back my messenger.\n\nGentleman I heard that the night before they had no intention\n\nof going.\n\nKent Greetings, noble master!\n\nLear What, is this sort of disgrace a hobby with you?\n\nKent No, my lord.\n\nFool Ha, ha, he’s wearing cruel [ a pun on “crewel,” that is,\n\n“worsted” ] garters! Horses are tied by the heads, dogs and\n\nbears by the neck, monkeys by the waist, and men by the\n\nlegs. When a man gets too frisky, then he has to wear\n\nwooden stockings.\n\nLear Who has so mistaken your status that he has placed you\n\nhere?\n\nKent lt’s both “he” and “she”: your son-in-law and daughter.\n\nLear No.\n\nKent Yes.\n\nLear No, I say!\n\nKent I say yes.\n\nLear No, no. They would not!\n\nKent Yes, yes. They have.\n\nLear By Jupiter, I swear no!\n\nKent By Juno, I swear yes.\n\nLear They wouldn’t dare do it. They could not – would\n\nnot – do it! It’s worse than murder to do such a violent\n\noutrage against the King’s officer. Tell me, with reasonable\n\nhaste, how you could have deserved – or they imposed –\n\nthis treatment, coming as you did from me.\n\nKent My lord, when I delivered your Highness’s letters to\n\nthem at their home, I’d no sooner risen from my bow than a\n\nsweating courier, anxious in his haste, half breathless, came\n\npanting greetings from his mistress Goneril. He delivered\n\nletters, ignoring the fact that he was interrupting me, which\n\nthey read at once. On noting the contents, they summoned\n\ntheir servants and immediately took to their horses. They\n\nordered me to follow and await an answer at their leisure.\n\nThey gave me cold looks. So when I met the other\n\nmessenger here – whose welcome, I realized, had poisoned\n\nmine – and observed that he was the very same fellow who\n\nhad recently behaved so insolently before your Highness,\n\nhaving more courage than sense, I drew my sword. He\n\nawakened the servants with his loud and cowardly cries.\n\nYour son-in-law and daughter found this offense worthy of\n\nthe shame I’m now suffering.\n\nFool Winter isn’t over while there are wild geese about like\n\nthat!\n\nFathers who’ve no money\n\nHave children who ignore ‘em.\n\nBut fathers who are rich\n\nHave children who adore ‘em.\n\nLuck, that shameless whore,\n\nNever helps the poor.\n\nSo, you’ll have more income [ a pun : dolours ( sorrows )\n\nversus dollars ( money )] from your daughters than you can\n\ncope with in one year.\n\nLear Oh, how this smothering feeling spreads up towards my\n\nheart! [ He opens his collar ] The choking disease! Stay down,\n\nyou spreading sorrow, keep your lowly place! Where is this\n\ndaughter?\n\nKent With the Earl, sir, indoors.\n\nLear Don’t follow me. Stay here.\n\n[ He rushes off ]\n\nGentleman Did you really give no more offense than that?\n\nKent None. How come the King has so few with him?\n\nFool If you’d been put in the stocks for that question, you\n\nwould have well deserved it.\n\nKent Why, Fool?\n\nFool You must learn from the ant: there’s nothing to be\n\ngained from toiling on behalf of a lost cause. All who follow\n\ntheir noses are guided by their eyes, except blind men, and\n\nmost of them can smell a man who stinks. When a huge\n\nwheel runs down a hill, don’t hold onto it lest you break your\n\nneck trying to keep up with it. When it’s going upwards,\n\nthough, let it pull you with it. When a wise man gives you\n\nbetter advice, return mine. It’s really only for knaves, since\n\nit’s given by a Fool.\n\nThe man who works in hope of gain,\n\nAnd has no sense of loyalty,\n\nWill quit when fortune’s on the wane,\n\nAnd leave you in calamity.\n\nBut I won’t leave. The Fool will stay,\n\nAnd let the wise man go;\n\nThe knave turns Fool who runs away;\n\nThis Fool’s no knave, you know.\n\nKent Where did you learn this, Fool?\n\nFool Not in the stocks, fool.\n\n[ Lear  returns with  Gloucester ]\n\nLear Refused to speak to me! They are sick? They are tired?\n\nThey’ve traveled all night? Mere excuses: yes, the\n\nsymbols of revolt and desertion. Bring me a better answer.\n\nGloucester My dear lord, you know the fiery temperament of\n\nthe Duke; how obstinate and determined he is in having his\n\nown way.\n\nLear Vengeance! Plague! Death! Confusion! “Fiery”! What\n\n“temperament”? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester, I want to\n\nspeak to the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.\n\nGloucester Well, my good lord, I have informed them so.\n\nLear “Informed” them! Do you understand me, man?\n\nGloucester Yes, my good lord.\n\nLear The King wishes to speak to Cornwall. … The dear\n\nfather wants to speak to his daughter, commands her\n\nobedience! Are they informed of this? My breath and blood!\n\n“Fiery”? The “fiery Duke”? Tell the hot-tempered Duke\n\nthat – [ he stops short ] No, but not yet. Perhaps he isn’t\n\nwell. Illness does cause neglect of the duties we perform\n\nwhen we are fit. We are not ourselves when illness causes\n\nthe mind to suffer as well as the body. I’ll restrain myself\n\nand check my impetuous inclination to think what’s done in\n\nsickness represents the healthy man. [ He looks at  Kent  in\n\nthe stocks and flares up again ] Death to my royal power!\n\nWhy should he be sitting here? This deed convinces me that\n\nthis aloofness of the Duke and her is pure deceit. I want my\n\nservant out of the stocks! Go and tell the Duke and his wife\n\nthat I want to speak to them. Now. At once! Tell them to\n\ncome out and hear me, or I’ll beat a drum at their bedroom\n\ndoor till they think they’ll never sleep again!\n\nGloucester I’d like all to be well between you.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nLear [ holding his chest ] Oh, me! My heart is rising. But, down!\n\nFool Give it its orders, uncle, as the cockney woman did the\n\neels, when she put them in the fish paste alive! She rapped\n\nthem over the head with a stick, and cried, “Down, you\n\nplayful creatures, down!” It was her brother who, out of\n\npure kindness to his horse, put butter on his hay.\n\n[ Gloucester  returns, with  Cornwall, Regan  and Servants ]\n\nLear Good morning to you both.\n\nCornwall Hail to your Grace!\n\n[ Kent  is set free ]\n\nRegan I am glad to see your Highness.\n\nLear Regan, I believe you are. I well know the reason for\n\nthinking so. If you were not glad, I would denounce the\n\ngrave of your mother, because it would be the tomb of an\n\nadulteress. [ To  Kent ] Oh, are you free? We’ll discuss that\n\nsome other time. [ Kent  leaves ] Beloved Regan, your sister is\n\nwicked. Oh, Regan, her sharp-toothed unkindness has\n\nstabbed at my heart like a vulture that’s been tied there. I\n\ncan hardly speak to you. You won’t believe the depraved\n\nmanner with which – [ he chokes ] Oh, Regan!\n\nRegan Really, sir, have patience. I hope that you are\n\nundervaluing her, not she falling short of her duty.\n\nLear What did you say? How do you mean?\n\nRegan I can’t believe my sister would fail in her obligation to\n\nyou in the least. If, sir, she has indeed checked the rioting of\n\nyour followers, it would be on such grounds, and to such a\n\ndesirable end, as to clear her from all blame.\n\nLear My curses on her!\n\nRegan Oh, sir, you are old. You are at the end of your life. You\n\nshould be governed and led by some wiser person who\n\nknows you better than you do yourself. Therefore I beg\n\nyou return to our sister. Tell her you have wronged her.\n\nLear Ask her forgiveness? How becoming this would be to\n\nroyalty! “Dear daughter, I admit that I am old. Old people are\n\na nuisance. On my knees I beg you to grant me clothes, bed\n\nand food.” [ He kneels to drive his point home ]\n\nRegan Good sir, no more of this. These are unseemly tricks.\n\nReturn to my sister.\n\nLear [ rising ] Never, Regan. She has deprived me of half my\n\nretinue, given me black looks, and lashed me with her\n\ntongue most viciously upon the heart itself. May the entire\n\nstock of heaven’s vengeances drop on her ungrateful head!\n\nStrike her unborn children with lameness, you infectious\n\nwinds!\n\nCornwall Come, sir, come!\n\nLear Swift-moving lightning, aim your blinding flames into her\n\neyes! Infect her beauty, you fogs sucked up from the fens\n\nby the heat of the powerful sun, to strike and make her ugly!\n\nRegan Oh, the blessed gods! That’s what you’ll wish on me\n\nwhen you’re in one of your rash moods!\n\nLear No, Regan, I will never curse you. Your tender-hearted\n\nnature couldn’t turn to harshness. Her eyes are fierce, but\n\nyours are comforting, and do not smolder. It’s not in your\n\nnature to begrudge me my pleasures, to reduce my retinue,\n\nto exchange hasty words, to cut down my allowances, and\n\nfinally to lock me out. You know your natural duties; the\n\nobligations of child to parent; the ways of good manners;\n\nthe responsibilities of gratitude. You haven’t forgotten the\n\nhalf of the kingdom that I gave to you.\n\nRegan Good sir, get to the point.\n\nLear Who put my man in the stocks? [ A trumpet sounds ]\n\nCornwall Whose trumpet is that?\n\nRegan I recognize it: my sister’s. This confirms her letter, that\n\nshe’d be here soon.\n\n[ Oswald  enters ]\n\nHas your lady arrived?\n\nLear [ glowering at  Oswald ] This is the wretch whose\n\nimpudence depends on the fickle patronage of his mistress.\n\nGet out of my sight, rascal!\n\nCornwall What does your Grace mean?\n\nLear Who put my servant in the stocks? Regan, I trust you\n\ndidn’t know about it. [ Goneril  approaches ] Who comes\n\nhere? Oh, gods: if you love old men; if your gracious\n\npower approves of obedience; if you yourselves are old;\n\nmake this an issue. Intercede, and take up my cause! [ To\n\nGoneril ] Are you not ashamed to look upon this beard? [ The\n\nsisters embrace ] Oh, Regan, will you hold her hand?\n\nGoneril Why not my hand, sir? What have I done wrong? All is\n\nnot “offense” simply because it’s so-called by the\n\nirresponsible and those in their dotage.\n\nLear [ holding his heart ] Is there no release? [ To  Cornwall ]\n\nHow did my man come to be in the stocks?\n\nCornwall I put him there, sir. His misconduct merited worse.\n\nLear You! Did you?\n\nRegan Really, father, being weak, act accordingly. If you will\n\nreturn with my sister and stay with her till the end of your\n\nmonth – dismissing half your retinue – you can then come\n\nto me. I am away from home now, and unable to provide\n\nproperly for your maintenance.\n\nLear Return to her? With fifty men dismissed? No! Instead, I\n\nreject all shelter, and choose to fight the elements, befriend\n\nthe wolf and owl, suffer hardship! Return with her? Why, I\n\ncould as well be made to kneel before the throne of\n\npassionate France, who took our youngest-born without a\n\ndowry, and beg a pension from him, like some petty squire,\n\nto make ends meet. Return with her? I’d rather you\n\npersuaded me to be slave and drudge to this detested\n\nservant! [ He points at  Oswald ]\n\nGoneril Please yourself, sir.\n\nLear I beg you, daughter, do not make me mad. I won’t\n\ntrouble you, my child. Farewell. We’ll meet no more. We’ll\n\nsee each other no more. [ His anger returns ] But still you are\n\nmy flesh and blood, my daughter; or rather, a disease that’s\n\nin my flesh, which is mine whether I like it or not. You’re a\n\nboil, a plague-sore, a swollen tumor in my infected blood!\n\n[ Calm again ] But I won’t curse you. Let shame choose its\n\nown time – I won’t summon it. I do not call on Jupiter for\n\nvengeance, or tell tales about you to Jove, whose\n\njudgment is supreme. Reform when you can. Be better at\n\nyour leisure. I can be patient. I can stay with Regan, I and\n\nmy hundred knights.\n\nRegan Not quite. I wasn’t expecting you yet, nor am I\n\nprepared for a fitting welcome. Listen to my sister.\n\nAnyone considering your words dispassionately would\n\nconclude you are old, and therefore – but she knows what\n\nshe is doing.\n\nLear Is this well said?\n\nRegan It certainly is, sir. What, fifty followers? Isn’t that\n\nplenty? Why should you need more? Yes, or so many, since\n\nthe expense and the danger both argue against so great a\n\nnumber? How, in one house, could so many people under\n\ntwo commands live in harmony? It’s difficult – almost\n\nimpossible.\n\nGoneril Why couldn’t you, my lord, be attended by her\n\nservants, or by mine?\n\nRegan Why not, my lord? If they happened to become\n\nneglectful, we could correct them. If you want to come to\n\nme, because now I perceive a danger, I would ask you to\n\nbring only twenty-five. I’ll accommodate and recognize no\n\nmore.\n\nLear I gave you everything …\n\nRegan And you took your time about it!\n\nLear … made you my stewardesses and trustees, but with a\n\nproviso that I should have a retinue of such a number.\n\nWhat? Must I come to you with twenty-five? Regan, is that\n\nwhat you said?\n\nRegan And say it again, my lord. No more with me.\n\nLear Some wicked creatures seem attractive when compared\n\nwith others more wicked still. Not being the worst is some\n\nmeasure of praise. [ To  Goneril ] I’ll go with you. Your fifty is\n\ntwice twenty-five, and your love is double hers.\n\nGoneril Listen to me, my lord. Why do you need twenty-\n\nfive – ten – or five – to attend you, in a house where twice\n\nas many are at your service?\n\nRegan What need have you of one?\n\nLear Oh, don’t argue about “need”! Our lowliest beggars\n\nhave something they could do without. If you argue for the\n\nbare necessities, then man’s life would be no better than a\n\nbeast’s. You are a lady: if being warm were the purpose of\n\nbeing well-dressed, well then, there’d be no physical reason\n\nfor the fashionable clothes you are wearing, which hardly\n\nkeep you warm. Whereas true need – [ he breaks off ]\n\nHeavens, give me patience, the patience I require! You see\n\nme here, you gods, a poor old man, as full of grief as I am of\n\nage; wretched in both respects! If you are responsible for\n\nturning these daughters’ hearts against their father, don’t\n\nmake me such a fool as to bear it tamely! Inspire me with\n\nnoble anger, and don’t let women’s weapons – tears –\n\nstain my man’s cheeks! No, you unnatural hags, I’ll do such\n\nthings in revenge – I can’t say what at present, but they will\n\nbe earth-shattering! You think I’ll cry? No, I won’t cry. I’ve\n\ngot every reason to cry [ thunder claps are heard in the\n\ndistance ], but this heart of mine will break into a hundred\n\nthousand pieces before I’ll cry. Oh, Fool! I shall go mad! [ He\n\nstaggers out, followed by  Gloucester,  the  Gentleman  and\n\nthe  Fool ]\n\nCornwall Let us go in. There’s going to be a storm.\n\nRegan This is a small house. The old man and his retinue\n\ncan’t be adequately lodged.\n\nGoneril It’s his own fault. He’s upset himself, and he must\n\nsuffer for his folly.\n\nRegan For himself, I’ll take him gladly. But not one follower.\n\nGoneril That’s my attitude exactly. Where is my Lord of\n\nGloucester?\n\nCornwall He followed the old man out. He’s back.\n\n[ Gloucester  enters ]\n\nGloucester The King is in a terrible rage.\n\nCornwall Where is he going?\n\nGloucester He’s summoned the horses. Where he’s going, I\n\ndon’t know.\n\nCornwall Best give him his own way. He’s his own master.\n\nGoneril My lord, by no means plead with him to stay.\n\nGloucester Alas! It’s almost night, and the bleak winds are\n\nblustering fiercely. There’s hardly a bush for miles around.\n\nRegan Oh, sir, willful men can only learn by suffering from\n\ntheir own actions. Shut your doors. His attendants are a\n\ndesperate lot, and it’s only sensible to fear what they might\n\nprovoke him into doing. He’s apt to be misled.\n\nCornwall Shut your doors, my lord. It’s a wild night. My\n\nRegan’s advice is sound. Come out of the storm.\n\n[ They leave ]\n\nAct three\n\nScene 1\n\nA heath during a violent storm.  Kent  and a  Gentleman  meet.\n\nKent Who’s there, besides foul weather?\n\nGentleman Someone as disturbed as the weather is.\n\nKent I know you. Where’s the King?\n\nGentleman He’s battling with the angry elements. He tells the\n\nwind to blow the earth into the sea, or raise the waves\n\nabove the mainland, to bring chaos or destruction. He tears\n\nhis white hair, which violent blasts, blind with rage, seize in\n\ntheir fury and treat with scant respect. He strives with his\n\npuny human frame to out-storm the wind and rain as it\n\nswirls to and fro in conflict. Tonight, when even the\n\nhungry mother-bear takes cover, and the lion and the\n\nstarving wolf keep their fur dry, he runs bareheaded, and\n\ncries out in reckless desperation.\n\nKent But who is with him?\n\nGentleman Only the Fool, who tries to joke away his master’s\n\nheartfelt injuries.\n\nKent Sir, I know you, and on that account I’ll risk entrusting\n\nsomething important to you. Although it’s concealed by\n\ntheir craftiness, there is a rift between Albany and Cornwall.\n\nThey have servants – which great ones have not? – who\n\nseem genuine, but who are spies supplying information\n\nabout our kingdom to the King of France: either concerning\n\nthe quarrels and intrigues of the Dukes; or the tough way\n\nboth have handled the kind old King; or something more\n\nprofound, of which these are perhaps the outward\n\nmanifestations. But the fact is that an army has arrived,\n\nfrom France, in this divided kingdom. Taking advantage of\n\nour negligence, they have already established a secret\n\nfoothold in some of our best ports, and are on the point of\n\nrevealing themselves. Now, as for you, if you’ll trust me to\n\nthe extent of hastening to Dover, you’ll find men there\n\nwho’ll thank you for delivering a true account of the\n\nunnatural and maddening sorrow which the King is suffering\n\nfrom. I am a gentleman of noble blood and good breeding,\n\nand I offer this commission to you on reliable information.\n\nGentleman I’d like to discuss this further.\n\nKent No, don’t. For confirmation that I am more than my\n\noutward appearance suggests, open this purse and take\n\nwhat it contains. [ The  Gentleman  finds a ring inside ] If you\n\nshould see Cordelia – and no doubt you will – show her this\n\nring, and she will tell you who the fellow is who’s now\n\nunknown to you. Damn this storm! I’ll look for the King.\n\nGentleman Give me your hand. Have you nothing to add?\n\nKent Few words, but of prime importance. When we find the\n\nKing – you go that way, and I’ll go this – whoever sees him\n\nfirst, shout to the other.\n\n[ They leave separately ]\n\nScene 2\n\nAnother part of the heath. The storm still rages.  Lear  and the  Fool  enter.\n\nLear Blow, winds, and burst your cheeks! Rage! Blow! You\n\nfloodgates and waterspouts: gush till you’ve drenched our\n\nchurch steeples and drowned the weathercocks! You\n\nsearing and mind-dazzling flashes – forerunners of\n\noak-splitting thunderbolts – singe my white head! And you,\n\nall-shaking thunder: flatten the globe! Crack the molds\n\nwhich Nature uses for replenishment! Destroy in an instant\n\nthe seeds from which ungrateful man is born!\n\nFool Oh, uncle, flattery in a house that’s dry is better than\n\na drenching out in the open. Good uncle, go in and ask a\n\nblessing from your daughters. This is a night fit for neither\n\nwise men nor fools.\n\nLear Rumble your bellyful! Spit, fire! Spout, rain! Rain, wind,\n\nthunder, fire – they’re not my daughters! I don’t accuse you,\n\nyou natural elements, of unkindness! I never gave you a\n\nkingdom, or called you children. You owe me no deference.\n\nSo enjoy yourselves: Here I stand, your victim – a poor,\n\ninfirm, weak and despised old man! You’re no better than\n\nservile lackeys if you’ll conspire with two pernicious\n\ndaughters to use your heavenly battalions against a head so\n\nold and white as mine! Oh, it’s despicable!\n\nFool The man who has a house to put his head in has got a\n\nhat with brains under it.\n\nThe horny man who fornicates\n\nBefore he saves a penny,\n\nHis life to lice he dedicates\n\nSo beggars marry many.\n\nThe foolish man who cherishes\n\nHis toe more than his heart,\n\nWill think from corns he perishes\n\nAnd wake up with a start.\n\nThere never yet was a beautiful woman who didn’t preen\n\nherself in front of a mirror.\n\n[ Kent  enters ]\n\nLear [ to himself ] No, I will be a model of patience. I’ll say\n\nnothing.\n\nKent Who’s there?\n\nFool Indeed, here’s graciousness and vulgarity – that is, a\n\nwise man and a Fool.\n\nKent Alas, sir, are you here? Even nocturnal things dislike\n\nsuch nights as these. The angry skies terrify even the wild\n\nanimals and make them keep to their caves. Since I was\n\ngrown, I don’t remember ever having seen such sheets of\n\nfire, or heard such peals of thunder, such groans of roaring\n\nwind and rain. Man is not made to endure such suffering\n\nand fear.\n\nLear Let the almighty gods, who are making this dreadful\n\nhubbub over our heads, identify their enemies now!\n\nTremble, you wretch, with your undiscovered crimes as yet\n\nunpunished! Hide yourself, you murderer; you perjurer; you\n\nincestuous humbug! Rogue, shiver yourself to pieces: under\n\ncover of convenient hypocrisy you’ve tricked your way\n\nthrough life! Well-hidden crimes, burst out from your\n\nconcealment, and plead for mercy from those dreadful\n\nministers of vengeance! [ Removing his hat to show he has\n\nnothing to fear himself ] I am a man who’s been more sinned\n\nagainst than ever he has sinned.\n\nKent Alas, bare-headed! My gracious lord, there is a shed\n\nclose by here. It will afford you some friendly protection\n\nagainst the tempest. Rest there, while I return to this cruel\n\nhouse – whose occupants, harder-hearted than the stone of\n\nwhich it is made, recently refused me admittance when I\n\ninquired after you – to wrest from them the courtesy they\n\nhave failed to show.\n\nLear My mind is going. [ To the  Fool ] Come on, my boy. [ He\n\nputs his arm around him ] How are you, my boy? Are you\n\ncold? I’m cold myself. [ To  Kent ] Where is this straw, my\n\nfellow? Need transforms things strangely. It can make what’s\n\npaltry, precious. Come then, to your shed. Poor Fool and\n\nknave, there’s one part of my heart that’s sorry still for you.\n\nFool [ he sings ] He whose brain is somewhat dim,\n\nWith hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n\nMust take what Fortune gives to him\n\nThough the rain keeps raining every day.\n\nLear True, boy. [ To  Kent ] Come, take us to this shed. [ Lear\n\nand  Kent  go ]\n\nFool This is a fine night for cooling down a lustful wench. I’ll\n\nspeak a prophecy before I go:\n\nWhen priests are theorists, not doers;\n\nWhen beer is watered by the brewers;\n\nWhen nobles teach their tailors stitches;\n\nAnd lusty lads all suffer itches;\n\nWhen every case is right in law;\n\nNo gentry-folk say they are poor;\n\nWhen tongues aren’t used for slanderous tales;\n\nAnd thieves aren’t caught and sent to jails;\n\nWhen moneylenders show their hoards;\n\nAnd churches are endowed by bawds;\n\nThen shall all the British nation\n\nCome to its humiliation.\n\nThat’s when, if you are still around,\n\nFeet will be used to walk on ground.\n\nMerlin the magician will make this prophecy one day. I was\n\nborn before his time.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nScene 3\n\nA room in Gloucester’s castle after dark.  Gloucester  and  Edmund  enter , carrying torches.\n\nGloucester Alas, alas! Edmund, I don’t like this unnatural\n\nbehavior. When I asked their permission to take pity on\n\nhim, they commandeered my house, and ordered me – on\n\npain of their permanent displeasure – neither to speak of\n\nhim, plead for him, or in any way sustain him.\n\nEdmund How savage and unnatural!\n\nGloucester Sh! Say nothing. The Dukes have quarreled, and\n\nsomething worse: I’ve had a letter about it tonight. It’s too\n\ndangerous to talk about; I’ve locked it in my bedroom. These\n\nwrongs the King is suffering will be revenged to the full.\n\nPart of an army has already landed; we must take the King’s\n\nside. I’ll look for him and aid him secretly. Go and keep the\n\nDuke talking, so that he won’t observe my charity. If he asks\n\nfor me, say I’m ill and gone to bed. Even if I die for it – as\n\nthey’ve threatened me – the King, my old master, must be\n\ngiven help. Strange things are about to happen, Edmund. Do\n\nbe careful.\n\n[ He goes in search of  Lear ]\n\nEdmund I’ll tell the Duke at once about this kindness, which\n\nyou have been forbidden to do. And the letter, too. This\n\nshould be worth something to me, and must gain me what\n\nmy father will lose: nothing less than everything! The young\n\nrise when the old fall.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nScene 4\n\nThe heath, in front of the shed.  Lear  enters, with  Kent  and the  Fool.\n\nKent Here’s the place, my lord. Good my lord, go in. The\n\nsuffering of a night out in the open is too much for flesh and\n\nblood to endure.\n\n[ The storm rages on unabated ]\n\nLear Leave me alone.\n\nKent Good my lord, go in.\n\nLear Will you break my heart?\n\nKent I’d rather break my own. Good my lord, enter.\n\nLear You think it’s remarkable that this raging storm soaks us\n\nto the skin. So it is, to you. But where there’s a greater\n\nsuffering, the lesser is hardly felt. You’d avoid a bear; but if\n\nyour escape lay toward the roaring sea, you’d tackle the\n\nbear face to face. When there’s nothing on your mind, you\n\nare conscious of your ailments; this tempest going on in my\n\nmind obliterates all feeling other than what’s tormenting\n\nme – the ingratitude of my daughters! Isn’t it equivalent to\n\nmy mouth biting my hand for lifting food to it? I’ll punish\n\nruthlessly! No, I’ll weep no more. To shut me out on a night\n\nlike this! [ To the rain ] Pour on – I can take it! [ To  Kent ] On\n\nsuch a night as this! Oh, Regan, Goneril! Your kind old father,\n\nwhose open-heartedness gave you all! Oh, that way leads to\n\nmadness! Let me avoid that! I mustn’t think of that!\n\nKent Good my lord, go in here.\n\nLear Please go in yourself: seek some comfort. This tempest\n\nprevents me from thinking about things that would hurt me\n\nmore. But I’ll go in. [ To the  Fool ] In, boy. Go first. [ He\n\nreturns to his thoughts ] You who are poor and\n\nhomeless – [ noting the  Fool  is hesitant ] No – go in. I’ll pray\n\nand then I’ll sleep. [ The  Fool  obeys ] Poor naked wretches,\n\nwherever you are, that endure the pelting of this pitiless\n\nstorm: how shall your bare heads and bony bodies, your\n\ntattered-and-torn raggedness, protect you from storms such\n\nas these? Oh, I’ve cared too little about this! Take a dose of\n\nthis medicine, great ones! Expose yourself to feel what\n\nwretches feel, so that you can share their extra wealth, and\n\nshow that the gods are just!\n\nEdgar [ from inside, as if he’s taking soundings from a sinking\n\nship ] Fathom and a half! Fathom and a half! Poor Tom!\n\n[ The  Fool  rushes out, terrified ]\n\nFool Don’t come in here, uncle. There’s a ghost. Help me,\n\nhelp me!\n\nKent Give me your hand. [ Calling inside ] Who’s there?\n\nFool A spirit, a spirit! He says his name’s Poor Tom.\n\nKent Who are you, grumbling there in the straw? Come out.\n\n[ Edgar  appears, disguised as a madman ]\n\nEdgar [ talking dementedly ] Go away! The foul fiend follows\n\nme! The cold winds blow through the prickly hawthorn\n\nbushes. Hmm. [ To  Lear ] Go to your bed and get warm.\n\nLear Did you give everything to your daughters? And have you\n\ncome down to this?\n\nEdgar Who gives anything to Poor Tom? The foul fiend has\n\nled him through fire and through flame, through ford and\n\nwhirlpool, over bog and quagmire. He’s put knives under his\n\npillow, and hung nooses from his balconies. He’s put\n\npoison by his soup; made him overproud, riding a brown\n\ntrotting-horse over narrow bridges, chasing his own shadow\n\nas if it were a traitor. Bless your five wits! Tom’s cold. [ He\n\nshivers and stamps his feet, making noises to warm himself ]\n\nOh, do-de, do-de, do-de! Bless you against whirlwinds,\n\nshooting stars and evil influences! Do Poor Tom a favor,\n\nwho’s tormented by the foul fiend. [ He swipes at an\n\nimaginary attacker ] I could catch him now – and there – and\n\nthere again – and there!\n\n[ The storm rages on ]\n\nLear What, have his daughters brought him to this? Could you\n\nsave nothing? Did you give them everything?\n\nFool No, he kept a blanket, or he would all have been shamed.\n\nLear May all the plagues that hover menacingly in the air over\n\nmen’s faults now descend upon your daughters!\n\nKent He has no daughters, sir.\n\nLear Death to you, traitor! Nothing could have brought him\n\ndown to this but his unkind daughters! Is it the fashion now\n\nfor discarded fathers to endure such sufferings of the flesh?\n\nHow just the punishment! It was this very flesh that\n\nconceived those father-killing daughters!\n\nEdgar [ reciting an old rhyme ] “Pillycock sat on Pillycock Hill.”\n\n[ The second line is “If he’s not gone, he sits there still,” but\n\nEdgar  replaces it with howling noises ] Alow, alow! Loo!\n\nLoo!\n\nFool This cold night will turn us all into fools or madmen.\n\nEdgar Beware of the foul fiend. Obey your parents. Tell no\n\nlies. Don’t swear. Commit no adultery. Do not yearn for\n\nsplendid clothes. [ He shudders ] Tom feels cold.\n\nLear What were you?\n\nEdgar A lover, proud in heart and mind. I curled my hair, wore\n\nlove-tokens in my hat, fulfilled the heart’s desire of my loved\n\none and slept with her. I made vows with every word I\n\nspoke, and broke them openly. My dreams were fantasies\n\nof lust; I awoke to practice them. Wine I loved deeply;\n\ngambling, dearly; as for women, I had more mistresses than\n\nthe Sultan of Turkey. I was deceitful; interested in scandal;\n\nquick to draw blood; as lazy as a hog, stealthy as a fox,\n\ngreedy as a wolf, mad as a dog, ruthless as a lion. Don’t be\n\nturned on by the creaking of shoes or the sound of rustling\n\nsilks. Keep your feet out of brothels, your hand away from\n\npetticoats, your signature from moneylenders’ ledgers, and\n\ndefy the foul fiend. The cold wind blows through the\n\nhawthorn bushes: it says [ imitating the sound ] “suum,\n\nmum, hey-no-nonny.” [ He seems to recognize a presence ]\n\nThe devil, my boy, boy! [ He puts his finger to his lips ] Sh!\n\nLet him pass by.\n\n[ The storm rages on ]\n\nLear You’d be better off in your grave than trying to endure\n\nthis extreme weather in your nakedness. Is man no more\n\nthan this? [ To the  Fool ] Note him well. [ To  Edgar ] You’re not\n\nindebted to the silkworm for its silk; or the ox for its hide;\n\nthe sheep for its wool; or the civet cat for its perfume.\n\n[ Pointing to himself,  Edgar  and the  Fool ] We three are\n\ntainted, but you are the genuine article! Basic man is only a\n\npoor, bare, two-legged animal such as you are. [ He begins\n\nto take off his clothes ] Off, off, you borrowings! Come,\n\nunbutton here!\n\nFool Please, uncle, don’t do that! It’s a wicked night to go\n\nswimming in. [ He sees  Gloucester  approaching carrying a\n\ntorch ] Now a little fire in a big field is like the heart of an old\n\nlecher: a small spark of life with all the rest of his body cold.\n\nLook, here comes a walking fire!\n\n[ Gloucester  enters with a torch ]\n\nEdgar This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet; he begins at\n\ncurfew-time, and walks about till midnight. He gives\n\ncataracts, squints eyes, and makes harelips. He mildews\n\nthe ripening wheat, and hurts the poor creatures of the\n\nearth.\n\nSaint Withold three times walked his land;\n\nHe met a demon and her ninefold band;\n\nHer progress he stayed,\n\nHer power he allayed,\n\nAnd “Be off with you, witch! Be off!”\n\nKent How is your Grace?\n\nLear [ peering in the dark ] Who’s he?\n\nKent [ to  Gloucester ] Who’s there? What are you looking for?\n\nGloucester Who are you, there? Your names?\n\nEdmund Poor Tom, who eats the swimming frog, the toad,\n\nthe tadpole, the wall-newt and the water-newt. When the\n\nfoul fiend rages, he eats cowdung instead of salads;\n\nswallows dead rats and dead dogs; drinks the scum from\n\nstanding ponds; is whipped from settlement to settlement,\n\nput in the stocks, imprisoned. He once had three suits and\n\nsix shirts, a horse to ride and weapons to wear,\n\nBut mice and rats and such small game\n\nHave been Tom’s food for seven long year.\n\nBeware of my devil. [ He talks to an invisible companion ] Be\n\nquiet, Smulkin! Be quiet, you fiend!\n\nGloucester What, has your Grace no better company?\n\nEdgar The King of the Devils is a gentleman. He’s called\n\n“Modo”, and “Mahu”.\n\nGloucester Humanity is so degraded, my lord, it hates its\n\nparents.\n\nEdgar Poor Tom is cold.\n\nGloucester [ to  Lear ] Come in with me. My sense of duty does\n\nnot stretch so far as to obey all your daughters’ harsh\n\ncommands. Though their orders are to bar my doors and let\n\nthis pitiless night have its way with you, I’ve nevertheless\n\nventured to find you and bring you where warmth and food\n\nare ready.\n\nLear First let me talk with this philosopher. [ To  Edgar ] What is\n\nthe cause of thunder?\n\nKent Good my lord, take his offer. Go into the house.\n\nLear I’ll have a word with this learned professor. What is your\n\nsubject?\n\nEdgar How to avoid the fiend, and to kill vermin.\n\nLear Let me ask you one word in private.\n\nKent Plead with him once more to go in, my lord. His mind is\n\nfailing.\n\nGloucester Can you blame him? [ Claps of thunder are heard\n\noverhead ] His daughters want him dead. Ah, that good\n\nKent : he said it would be like this, the poor, banished man!\n\nYou say the King is going insane. I’ll tell you this, my friend:\n\nI’m almost mad myself. I had a son, now disowned. He\n\nsought my life, only recently, recently. I loved him, friend.\n\nNo father loved his son more. To tell you the truth, the grief\n\nhas touched my mind. What a night this is! [ To  Lear ] I beg\n\nyour Grace –\n\nLear Oh, I beg your pardon, sir. [ To  Edgar ] Noble philosopher,\n\ndo join us.\n\nEdgar Tom’s cold.\n\nGloucester In, fellow, there – into the shed. Keep yourself\n\nwarm.\n\nLear Come, let’s all go in.\n\nKent This way, my lord.\n\nLear [ his arm around  Edgar ] With him: I want to be with my\n\nphilosopher.\n\nKent [ to  Gloucester ] Good my lord, humor him. Let him take\n\nthe fellow with him.\n\nGloucester You take charge of him.\n\nKent [ to  Edgar ] Come on, go with us.\n\nLear Come, good Athenian.\n\nGloucester [ to  Edgar ] Don’t say anything; don’t say anything.\n\nSh!\n\nEdgar Squire Roland to the dark tower came,\n\nHis motto was: Fie, foh, and fum:\n\nI smell the blood of an Englishman.\n\n[ They enter the shed ]\n\nScene 5\n\nA room in Gloucester’s castle.  Cornwall  and  Edmund  enter.  Cornwall  is waving a letter.\n\nCornwall I’ll have my revenge before I leave this house.\n\nEdmund What people will say about me, in putting loyalty\n\nbefore my feelings as a son, I fear to think.\n\nCornwall I see now that it wasn’t just your brother’s evil\n\ndisposition that made him seek his father’s death. He was\n\nprovoked into it, helped by his wicked nature.\n\nEdmund How wickedly unfortunate that loyalty to my country\n\nshould give me a feeling of guilt! This is the letter my father\n\nspoke of, which proves he is a spy acting on behalf of\n\nFrance. Oh, heavens! Would that this treason had never\n\nhappened, and that I wasn’t the one to discover it!\n\nCornwall Come with me to the Duchess.\n\nEdmund If the contents of this letter are true, you have\n\nimportant work to do.\n\nCornwall True or false, it has made you the Earl of\n\nGloucester. Find your father, so we can arrest him.\n\nEdmund [ aside ] If I find him giving aid and comfort to the\n\nKing, it will make the Duke even more suspicious. [ Aloud ] I\n\nshall continue in my loyal course, in spite of the painful\n\nconflict between duty and my feelings as a son.\n\nCornwall I have every confidence in you: and you’ll find I’ll\n\nmake you a more loving father.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 6\n\nA room in a farmhouse near the castle.  Gloucester  and  Kent  enter.\n\nGloucester This is better than the open air. Be thankful for it.\n\nI’ll try to make it more comfortable with what extras I can\n\nfind. I won’t be away long.\n\nKent His mind has completely gone under the stress. The\n\ngods reward your kindness!\n\n[ Gloucester  goes ]\n\n[ Lear  enters, with  Edgar  and the  Fool ]\n\nEdgar Frateretto calls me, and tells me that Nero fishes in the\n\nlake of hell. [ To the  Fool ] Pray, innocent one, and beware\n\nof the foul fiend!\n\nFool Now, uncle, can you tell me whether a madman is a\n\ngentleman, or just someone who is rich?\n\nLear A king, a king!\n\nFool No. The rich man’s son becomes a gentleman. Only a\n\nmadman would have his son a gentleman before he’s one\n\nhimself!\n\nLear [ brooding to himself about his ungrateful daughters ] To\n\nhave a thousand devils armed with red-hot pokers come\n\nchasing after them …\n\nEdgar [ jerking about ] The foul fiend is biting my back!\n\nFool Anyone’s mad who trusts in the tameness of a wolf, or\n\nthe health of a horse that’s for sale, or a boy’s love, or a\n\nwhore’s promise.\n\nLear [ still in a world of his own ] It shall be done. I’ll prosecute\n\nthem immediately. [ To  Edgar ] Come, sit you here, most\n\nlearned judge. [ To the  Fool ] You, wise sir, sit here. [ Rubbing\n\nhis hands ] Now, you she foxes!\n\nEdgar [ pointing to  Lear ] Look how he stands and glares! [ To\n\nthe imaginary plaintiff ] Are you showing off in the\n\nwitness-box, madam? [ He breaks out into a romantic\n\nlove-song ]\n\nCome over the stream, Bessy, to me –\n\nFool [ joining in, picking up his words ]\n\nHer boat’s got a leak,\n\nAnd she must not speak\n\nWhy she dares not come over to you!\n\nEdgar [ commenting on the quality of the  Fool’s  singing voice ]\n\nThe foul fiend haunts Poor Tom, disguised as a nightingale.\n\n[ He rubs his stomach ] Hoppedance is crying out in Tom’s\n\nbelly for two pickled herrings. Stop your rumbling, black\n\nangel: I’ve no food for you.\n\nKent [ to  Lear ] How are you, sir? Don’t be dismayed. Will you\n\nlie down and rest on these cushions?\n\nLear I’ll see their trial first. Bring in the witnesses. [ To  Edgar,\n\nwho is scantily attired ] Take your place, you man of justice,\n\nin your robes. [ To the  Fool ] And you, his learned colleague,\n\ntake your seat on the bench, at his side. [ To  Kent ] You are\n\none of the magistrates. You must sit too.\n\nEdgar Let us handle the case justly. [ He sings ]\n\nAre you sleeping or awake, jolly shepherd?\n\nYour sheep are in the corn.\n\nIf you’d only give one little blast on your whistle,\n\nYour sheep would come to no harm.\n\n[ He makes a noise with his mouth ] Purr! [ Explaining ] The cat\n\nis gray.\n\nLear [ pointing to an unoccupied seat ] Prosecute her first: it’s\n\nGoneril. I here take my oath before this honorable\n\nassembly, that she kicked the poor King, her father.\n\nFool Come here, mistress. Is your name Goneril?\n\nLear She can’t deny it.\n\nFool I beg your pardon. I mistook you for a stool!\n\nLear And here’s another one whose ugly looks reveal what\n\nher heart is made of. [ He jumps up excitedly ] Stop her there!\n\nArms, arms, sword, fire! There’s corruption here! [ To  Edgar ]\n\nFalse judge – why have you let her escape?\n\nEdgar Bless your five wits!\n\nKent Oh, for pity! Sir, where now is the self-control you have\n\nso often boasted of?\n\nEdgar [ aside, as himself ] My tears of sympathy for him are\n\nbeginning to ruin my disguise.\n\nLear Even the little dogs – Tray, Blanch and Sweetheart –\n\nsee, they are barking at me!\n\nEdgar Tom will throw his head at them. Get away, you curs!\n\nWhether your mouth is black or white,\n\nWith teeth that poison if they bite,\n\nMastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,\n\nHound or spaniel, her or him,\n\nOr bobtail tike, or droopy-tail –\n\nTom will make him weep and wail:\n\n’Cos, with throwing thus my head,\n\nDogs hurry out, and all are fled.\n\nDo de, de, de. Be quiet! Come, let’s march to wakes and\n\nfairs and market towns! Poor Tom, you need a drink.\n\nLear Let them dissect Regan, to see what’s festering\n\naround her heart. Is there any natural cause for these hard\n\nhearts? [ To  Edgar ] You, sir, I’ll engage you as one of my\n\nhundred knights, though I don’t like the cut of your clothes.\n\nYou’ll say they are Persian-style, but change them.\n\nKent Now, good my lord, lie here and rest for a while.\n\nLear [ as if at home in bed ] Make no noise, make no noise.\n\nDraw the curtains. So, so. We’ll have our supper in the\n\nmorning.\n\nFool And I’ll go to bed at noon.\n\n[ Gloucester  returns ]\n\nGloucester [ to  Kent ] Come here, friend. Where is my master\n\nthe King?\n\nKent Here, sir. But don’t bother him. His mind has gone.\n\nGloucester Good friend, I beg of you: take him in your arms.\n\nI’ve overheard a plot to kill him. There’s a stretcher ready:\n\nlay him on it, and drive toward Dover, friend, where you’ll\n\nmeet both welcome and protection. Lift your master up. If\n\nyou dally half an hour, his life, and yours, and all who\n\nsupport him, are certain to be lost. Take him up, take him\n\nup, and follow me. I’ll give you guidance and provisions.\n\nKent Distress has induced sleep. This rest might have\n\nsoothed your tortured nerves. If circumstances won’t allow\n\nthat, a cure will not be easy. [ To the  Fool ] Come, help to\n\ncarry your master. You must not stay behind.\n\nGloucester Come: come away.\n\n[ Kent, Gloucester  and the  Fool  leave, carrying  Lear ]\n\nEdgar When we see our betters suffering from wretchedness,\n\nour own miseries seem more bearable. Lonely suffering is\n\nmostly in the mind, which it ceases to be carefree and\n\nhappy. However, the mind is relieved of much suffering\n\nwhen grief and adversity are shared. How tolerable my pain\n\nseems now, when I see the King break beneath a burden\n\nthat only puts a strain on me. He suffers from his children,\n\nas I do from my father! Tom, away! Note the rumors of great\n\nevents. Throw off your disguise when you are cleared of the\n\nfalse charges that shame you, and you are reconciled to your\n\nfather. Whatever else happens tonight, may the King make a\n\nsafe escape! Meanwhile, stay in hiding!\n\nScene 7\n\nA room in Gloucester’s castle.  Cornwall, Regan, Goneril, Edmund  and Servants enter.\n\nCornwall [ to  Goneril ] Send a messenger quickly to my lord,\n\nyour husband. Show him this letter. [ It is the one  Gloucester\n\nmentioned in Act 3 Scene 3 ] The French army has landed.\n\nGo and find the traitor Gloucester!\n\n[ Several Servants leave ]\n\nRegan Hang him instantly!\n\nGoneril Blind him!\n\nCornwall Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, stay with our\n\nsister Goneril. The revenge we are proposing to take on your\n\ntraitorous father is not fit for you to see. Tell the Duke,\n\nwhen you see him, to prepare for war. We’ll do the same.\n\nOur messengers will keep us fully and swiftly informed. [ To\n\nGoneril ] Farewell, dear sister. [ To  Edmund ] Farewell, my\n\nLord of Gloucester.\n\n[ Oswald  enters ]\n\nWell, where’s the King?\n\nOswald My Lord of Gloucester has taken him away. Some\n\nthree dozen or so of his knights, eagerly searching for him,\n\nmet him at the castle gate. With some more of Lord\n\nGloucester’s men, they have gone toward Dover, where\n\nthey claim they have well-armed friends.\n\nCornwall Get horses for your mistress.\n\nGoneril Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.\n\nCornwall Edmund, farewell.\n\n[ Goneril, Edmund  and  Oswald  leave ]\n\nGo and find the traitor Gloucester! Tie him up like a thief,\n\nand bring him to us.\n\n[ Several Servants respond ]\n\nThough we can’t condemn him to death without a trial, we\n\ncan indulge our anger. Men may deplore it, but not stop it.\n\nWho’s there? The traitor?\n\n[ Servants enter with  Gloucester  their prisoner ]\n\nRegan The ungrateful fox! It’s him!\n\nCornwall Tie his withered arms tight!\n\nGloucester What do your Graces mean? My dear friends,\n\nremember you are my guests. Do me no injury, friends.\n\nCornwall Tie him, I say!\n\n[ The Servants tie him up ]\n\nRegan Tight! Tight! Oh, you filthy traitor!\n\nGloucester Merciless lady that you are, I’m not!\n\nCornwall Bind him to this chair. Villain, you’ll find –\n\n[ Regan  pulls  Gloucester’s  beard ]\n\nGloucester By the kind gods, it’s extremely rude to pull me\n\nby the beard!\n\nRegan [ holding up some hair ] So white, and such a traitor!\n\nGloucester Wicked lady, those hairs you’ve snatched from my\n\nchin will come to life and accuse you. I am your host, and as\n\nsuch you shouldn’t abuse my hospitality like robbers. What\n\nare you going to do?\n\nCornwall Come, sir. What letters have you had recently from\n\nFrance?\n\nRegan A straight answer: we know the truth.\n\nCornwall How have you conspired with the traitors who’ve\n\nlanded recently in the kingdom?\n\nRegan To whom have you sent the lunatic King? Speak!\n\nGloucester I’ve had a vague sort of letter from a neutral\n\nsource, not from an enemy.\n\nCornwall Cunning!\n\nRegan And untrue!\n\nCornwall Where have you sent the King?\n\nGloucester To Dover.\n\nRegan Why to Dover? Weren’t you told under threat of\n\ndeath –\n\nCornwall Why to Dover? Let him answer that.\n\nGloucester I’m tied to a stake like a bear. I must stand being\n\nbaited.\n\nRegan Why to Dover?\n\nGloucester Because I couldn’t see your cruel nails pluck out\n\nhis poor old eyes, nor your fierce sister’s boarish fangs slash\n\nhis anointed flesh. Faced with a storm like the one his bare\n\nhead endured, during a night as black as hell, the sea itself\n\nwould have risen up and quenched the stars. Yet, poor\n\nold heart, he helped the heavens to rage. If wolves had\n\nhowled at your gate at that ghastly time, you would have\n\nsaid, “Good porter, let them in.” All other cruel creatures\n\nyield to compassion. I’ll see that divine vengeance overtakes\n\nsuch children as you!\n\nCornwall See it you never shall. [ To the Servants ] You\n\nfellows, hold the chair. I’ll stamp my foot upon those eyes of\n\nyours!\n\nGloucester [ struggling ] Anyone who hopes to reach old age:\n\nhelp me! [ Cornwall  blinds  Gloucester  in one eye with his\n\nboot ] Oh, cruel! Oh, gods!\n\nRegan One side will mock the other. The other, too!\n\nCornwall [ raising his foot ] If you see vengeance –\n\n1st Servant Hold it, my lord. I’ve served you ever since I was\n\na child; but I’ve never served you better than I do now in\n\ntelling you to stop!\n\nRegan What, you dog!\n\n1st Servant If you were a man, I’d fight you over this!\n\nRegan What do you mean?\n\nCornwall Villain! [ They fight ]\n\n1st Servant Right, then: come on. Take your chance against\n\nan angry man! [ Cornwall is wounded ]\n\nRegan [ to another Servant ] Give me your sword. A peasant to\n\npresume like this? [ She runs him through from behind ]\n\n1st Servant Oh, you’ve killed me! My lord, you’ve one eye left\n\nto see him come to a bad end. Oh! [ He dies ]\n\nCornwall In case it should see more, we’ll prevent it. [ He\n\ngouges out  Gloucester’s remaining eye] Out, you vile piece\n\nof jelly! Where’s your twinkle now?\n\nGloucester [ groaning ] All’s dark and comfortless. Where is\n\nmy son, Edmund? Edmund, summon all the energy of nature\n\nto revenge this horrid act!\n\nRegan Pah! You treacherous villain! You are appealing to\n\nsomeone who hates you. It was Edmund who disclosed your\n\ntreasons to us. He’s too good to pity you.\n\nGloucester Oh, my follies! Then Edgar was wronged. Kind\n\ngods, forgive me and make him prosper!\n\nRegan [ to a Servant ] Go and throw him out. Let him smell his\n\nway to Dover.\n\n[ Gloucester  is pushed out ]\n\nHow are you, my lord? Are you all right?\n\nCornwall I’ve been hurt. Follow me, lady. Turn that eyeless\n\nvillain out. Throw this wretch [ the dead servant ] on the\n\ndunghill. Regan, I’m bleeding badly. This wound has come\n\nat the wrong time. Give me your arm.\n\n[ Cornwall  leaves, supported by  Regan ]\n\n2nd Servant I don’t care what wickedness I do, if this man\n\nprospers!\n\n3rd Servant If she has a long life, and dies a natural death, all\n\nwomen will turn into monsters!\n\n2nd Servant Let’s follow the old Earl, and get the madman to\n\nguide him wherever he wants to go. Nobody will criticize\n\nwhat a madman does.\n\n3rd Servant You go. I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs to\n\nmake a plaster for his bleeding face. Now, heaven help him!\n\n[ They go separately ]\n\nAct four\n\nScene 1\n\nThe heath.  Edgar  enters.\n\nEdgar It’s better to be like this – openly despised – than what\n\nis worse: scorned but deceived by flattery. The most\n\nwretched and dejected victim of ill fortune always has some\n\nhope, and is proof against fear. What’s more distressing is\n\nto cease to enjoy life at its best; when things are at their\n\nworst, they can only improve. Welcome, then, to the natural\n\nelements that surround me. This man you’ve made so\n\nwretched with your fierce winds owes you no thanks. But\n\nwho comes here?\n\n[ Gloucester  enters, led by an  Old Man ]\n\nMy father, guided by a commoner? World, world, oh, world!\n\nIt’s hatred of your ups and downs that makes us reconciled\n\nto death.\n\nOld Man [ to  Gloucester ] Oh, my good lord! I’ve been your\n\ntenant, and your father’s tenant, these eighty years.\n\nGloucester Away, go away. Good friend, be gone. Your help\n\ncan do me no good at all. It may do you some harm.\n\nOld Man You can’t see your way.\n\nGloucester I have no way, and therefore need no eyes. I\n\nstumbled when I could see. Very often prosperity makes us\n\ncomplacent, and adversity proves to be an asset. Oh, dear\n\nson Edgar, the object of your deluded father’s anger, if I\n\ncould only live to see you by touching you, I’d say I had my\n\neyes again.\n\nOld Man [ noticing  Edgar ] Hello, who’s there?\n\nEdgar [ aside ] Oh, gods! Who can ever say, “I’ve hit the\n\nbottom?” I’m worse than I was before.\n\nOld Man [ to  Gloucester ] It’s poor mad Tom.\n\nEdgar [ aside ] And worse may still be to come. The worst has\n\nnot happened as long as we can say, “This is the worst.”\n\nOld Man Fellow, where are you going?\n\nGloucester Is it a beggar man?\n\nOld Man Lunatic and beggar, too.\n\nGloucester He must have some intelligence, or he couldn’t\n\nbeg. In last night’s storm I saw such a fellow, which made\n\nme think mankind’s no better than a worm. My son then\n\ncame into my mind, though I was angry with him in my\n\nthoughts. The gods treat us like naughty boys treat flies;\n\nthey kill us for the fun of it.\n\nEdgar [ aside, commenting on his father’s blindness ] What has\n\nhappened? It’s a bad business having to joke with a man in\n\ndistress. Both parties resent it. [ Aloud ] Bless you, master.\n\nGloucester Is that the naked fellow?\n\nOld Man Yes, my lord.\n\nGloucester Then, please: go now. If, for my sake, you will\n\ncatch up with us a mile or two away from here – on the way\n\nto Dover – do it for old time’s sake. And bring some clothes\n\nfor this naked soul, whom I shall ask to escort me.\n\nOld Man Alas, sir, he is mad.\n\nGloucester It’s a sign of the sick times, when the mad lead\n\nthe blind. Do as I say, or rather as you feel inclined. Above\n\nall, go!\n\nOld Man I’ll bring him the best clothes I’ve got, and take the\n\nconsequences.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nGloucester You there: the naked fellow!\n\nEdgar Poor Tom is cold. [ Aside ] I can’t keep this up –\n\nGloucester Come here, fellow.\n\nEdgar – but I must. [ Resuming his disguise ] Bless your sweet\n\neyes. They are bleeding.\n\nGloucester Do you know the way to Dover?\n\nEdgar Cross-country, bridle-path and footpath. Poor Tom has\n\nbeen scared out of his good wits. Bless you, laddie, from the\n\nfoul fiend! Five devils have been in Poor Tom together:\n\nBidicut, the lusty one; Hoberdidance, the prince of\n\ndumbness; Mahu, of stealing; Modo, of murder;\n\nFlibbertigibbet, of making strange faces. They’ve since\n\npossessed chambermaids and serving-women. So, bless\n\nyou, master!\n\nGloucester Here, take this purse, you who’ve become\n\nreconciled to fortune’s worst afflictions. My wretchedness\n\nmakes you the better off. Heavens, stick to your policy! May\n\nthe man who’s well-heeled and overindulgent – who\n\nabuses your kind favors – who refuses to see things\n\nbecause he does not feel them personally – quickly\n\nexperience your power! Spreading the wealth out would\n\nremedy excess. Every man would have enough. Do you\n\nknow Dover?\n\nEdgar Yes, master.\n\nGloucester There is a cliff whose great and brooding height\n\npeers fearfully into the pounding sea below. Just take me to\n\nthe very edge of it, and I’ll help to remedy your misery with\n\nsomething valuable I’m carrying. From there I’ll need no\n\nguide.\n\nEdgar Give me your arm. Poor Tom will lead you.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 2\n\nNear the Duke of Albany’s palace. Enter  Goneril  and  Edmund,  who have traveled from Gloucester’s castle together.\n\nGoneril Welcome, my lord. I’m amazed that my meek and mild\n\nhusband didn’t meet us on the way.\n\n[ Oswald  enters ]\n\nWhere’s your master?\n\nOswald Madam, he’s indoors. But never was a man so\n\nchanged. I told him about the army that has landed; he\n\nsmiled at it. I told him you were coming; his answer was,\n\n“So much the worse.” When I informed him of Gloucester’s\n\ntreachery, and of the loyal services of his son, he called me\n\nan idiot and told me I’d got it wrong way round. What he\n\nought to dislike seems pleasant to him; what he should like,\n\noffensive.\n\nGoneril [ to  Edmund ] Then you must go no further. He’s too\n\ncowardly to take any action; he’ll avoid provocation. The\n\nhopes we expressed on the way here may be fulfilled. Go\n\nback, Edmund, to my brother-in-law. Speed up recruitment\n\nand lead his army. I must change roles at home, and give my\n\nhusband the embroidery to do. [ Pointing to  Oswald ] This\n\ntrusty servant will be our go-between. Soon you may well\n\nhear – if you’re not afraid to do yourself some good – a\n\ncertain command from your mistress … [ Edmund’s  hand\n\ngoes to his dagger; he realizes  Goneril  is hinting at the\n\nmurder of  Albany ] Wear this; there’s no need to say\n\nanything. [ She puts a chain around his neck ] Lower your\n\nhead. [ She kisses him ] This kiss, if it dared to speak, would\n\nrouse you … Keep me in your thoughts, and goodbye.\n\nEdmund Yours ever, until death!\n\nGoneril My dearest Gloucester!\n\n[ Edmund  leaves ]\n\nOh, the difference between one man and another! You\n\ndeserve what a woman has to give. I have a fool for my\n\nbedfellow.\n\nOswald Madam, here comes my lord.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\n[ Albany  enters ]\n\nGoneril You would once have thought I was worth the trouble\n\nof coming to meet me.\n\nAlbany Oh, Goneril! You are not worth the dust that the harsh\n\nwind blows in your face! I distrust your character. A nature\n\nthat can deny a parent cannot hold itself in check. As one\n\nwho has cut herself off from the main branch, you must of\n\nnecessity wither and die.\n\nGoneril Say no more. Your sermon is a silly one.\n\nAlbany Wisdom and goodness always seem vile to the vile.\n\nTo the filthy everything seems filthy. What have you done?\n\nTigers rather than daughters, what have you been up to? A\n\nfather, and a gracious elderly man – that even a captive\n\nbear would lick with reverence – you have barbarously and\n\ndegenerately made insane. How could my brother-in-law\n\nallow you to do it? A man – a prince – who owed so much\n\nto him! If the gods don’t quickly intervene by sending down\n\ntheir agents to punish these vile offenses, then surely men\n\nwill start eating each other, like the monsters of the sea!\n\nGoneril You coward, you’ll let anyone push you around! You\n\ncan’t distinguish between the tolerable and the insufferable.\n\nYou don’t realize that only fools pity villains who are\n\npunished before they do their mischief. Where’s your call to\n\narms? The King of France raises his flags in our docile\n\nland; the threat of war hangs over your country while you, a\n\nmoralizing fool, sit there and cry, “Alas, why is he doing\n\nthis?”\n\nAlbany See yourself for what you are, devil! Depravity, bad\n\nenough when seen in the fiend, is even more horrid in a\n\nwoman!\n\nGoneril You worthless idiot!\n\nAlbany You transformed and self-deceiving thing, for shame!\n\nStop acting like a monster! If I were inclined to let my\n\nemotions govern my behavior, these hands would tear your\n\nflesh and bones apart! Fiend though you are, your female\n\nform protects you.\n\nGoneril [ contemptuously ] You and your manhood! Pah!\n\n[ A  Messenger  enters ]\n\nAlbany What’s your news?\n\nMessenger Oh, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall is dead:\n\nkilled by his servant as he was putting out Gloucester’s\n\nother eye.\n\nAlbany Gloucester’s eyes!\n\nMessenger One of his servants, moved by compassion, made\n\nobjection, raising his sword against his great master.\n\nFurious at this, he [ the Duke ] attacked him, and the man\n\nwas struck dead; but not before the Duke sustained a mortal\n\nwound that later took his life.\n\nAlbany [ addressing the heavens ] This proves you are there\n\nabove, you judges, in that our worldly crimes are so\n\nspeedily revenged! But oh, poor Gloucester! Did he lose\n\nhis other eye?\n\nMessenger Both, my lord, both. [ To  Goneril ] This letter,\n\nmadam, requires a speedy answer. It’s from your sister.\n\nGoneril [ aside ] In one sense, I like this. However, she being a\n\nwidow and my Gloucester with her, all my dreams for the\n\nfuture could collapse in ruins. Looking at it another way, the\n\nnews is not so grievous. [ Aloud ] I’ll read it and answer it.\n\n[ She goes ]\n\nAlbany Where was his son when they blinded him?\n\nMessenger On his way here with my lady.\n\nAlbany He isn’t here.\n\nMessenger No, my good lord. I met him on his way back.\n\nAlbany Does he know about the wickedness?\n\nMessenger Yes, my good lord. It was he who informed\n\nagainst him [ his father ]. He left the house on purpose so\n\nthat they would have a free hand with their punishment.\n\nAlbany Gloucester, I live to thank you for the love that you\n\nhave shown the King, and to revenge your eyes! [ To the\n\nMessenger ] Come here, friend. Tell me what more you\n\nknow.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 3\n\nThe French camp near Dover. Enter  Kent  and a  Gentleman.\n\nKent Have you no idea why the King of France has returned\n\nso suddenly?\n\nGentleman He remembered something he’d forgotten to do in\n\nhis own kingdom which had such risky complications that\n\nhis return was vital and necessary.\n\nKent Which general has he left in charge?\n\nGentleman The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.\n\nKent Did your letters move Cordelia to any show of grief?\n\nGentleman Yes, sir. She took them, and read them in my\n\npresence. Every now and then a large tear trickled down her\n\nsoft cheek. She governed her emotions like a queen; they,\n\nlike rebels, tried to play the superior role of king.\n\nKent Oh, then she was moved by it?\n\nGentleman Not to distraction. Self-control vied with sorrow\n\nas to which should show more attractively in her face. You\n\nhave seen sunshine and rain happen together. Her smiles\n\nand tears were similar, but more attractive. The happy little\n\nsmiles that played on her ruby lips seemed unaware of the\n\ntears that lodged in her eyes. They fell like pearls dropping\n\nfrom diamonds. In short, sorrow would be a precious rarity if\n\nit were always as becoming as it was in her case.\n\nKent Did she ask no questions?\n\nGentleman Indeed, once or twice she gasped the name\n\n“Father” as if it pressed upon her heart. She cried, “Sisters!\n\nSisters! Disgrace to womanhood! Sisters! Kent! Father!\n\nSisters! What – in the storm? At night? For pity’s sake, it’s\n\nunbelievable!” At that point she let her holy tears fall from\n\nher heavenly eyes. Then away she went, calmed by her\n\noutburst, to cope with her grief in private.\n\nKent It’s the stars, the stars above us, who decide our\n\ncharacters! Otherwise parents couldn’t beget such different\n\nchildren. You’ve not spoken to her since?\n\nGentleman No.\n\nKent Was this before the King returned to France?\n\nGentleman No, after.\n\nKent Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear has reached Dover.\n\nSometimes in his more lucid moments he remembers why\n\nwe are here, and won’t in any circumstances consent to see\n\nhis daughter.\n\nGentleman Why, sir?\n\nKent An overpowering shame pushes him away. His\n\nown unkindness – which lost her his blessing, turned her\n\nout to live abroad as best she could, and gave her dowry to\n\nhis pitiless daughters – these things sting his mind so\n\npoisonously that he’s held back from Cordelia by a burning\n\nsense of shame.\n\nGentleman Alas, poor gentleman!\n\nKent You haven’t heard anything of the armies of Albany and\n\nCornwall?\n\nGentleman Yes. They are on the march.\n\nKent Well, sir, I’ll bring you to our master, Lear, and leave you\n\nto look after him. Important business will keep me privately\n\noccupied for some time. When I resume my real name, you\n\nwon’t be sorry you associated with me like this. Please,\n\ncome with me.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 4\n\nThe French camp near Dover.  Cordelia  enters with a  Doctor  and Soldiers.\n\nCordelia Alas, it’s he. He was found just now, as mad as the\n\nraging sea, singing aloud, with a crown of luxuriant fumitory\n\n[ an herb ] and common weeds – burdocks, hemlock, nettles,\n\ncuckoo-flowers, coarse grasses, and all the worthless\n\nweeds that grow among our health-giving corn. Send out\n\na troop of soldiers; search every acre in the fields of crops,\n\nand bring him to our sight.\n\n[ An Officer leaves ]\n\nWhat can man’s learning do to restore his lost reason? I’d\n\ngive all I possess to the man who can cure him.\n\nDoctor There is a way, madam. Sleep is nature’s\n\nnourishment, which he lacks. To induce it, there are many\n\neffective medicinal herbs, with the power to put pain to\n\nsleep.\n\nCordelia May all the blessed secrets and little-known\n\nremedies of the earth germinate with my tears! Be helpful\n\nand curative in the good man’s distress! Look, look for him,\n\nin case in his frenzy he ends a life that lacks the means to\n\nsurvive.\n\n[ Messenger  enters ]\n\nMessenger News, madam. The British army is marching\n\ntoward you.\n\nCordelia We know that. We are ready for them. Oh, dear\n\nfather! It is your interests I’m pursuing. That’s why my royal\n\nhusband has pitied my sorrowful and pleading tears. We\n\naren’t roused to war by puffed-up ambition, but by love,\n\ndear love, and our old father’s rights. May I soon hear and\n\nsee him!\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 5\n\nA room in Gloucester’s castle.  Regan  enters, followed by  Oswald,  who is carrying a letter.\n\nRegan Have my brother-in-law’s troops set out?\n\nOswald Yes, madam.\n\nRegan Himself there in person?\n\nOswald Madam, after a lot of fuss. Your sister is the better\n\nsoldier.\n\nRegan Lord Edmund didn’t speak to your lord at his home?\n\nOswald No, madam.\n\nRegan What was behind my sister’s letter to him?\n\nOswald I don’t know, lady.\n\nRegan Indeed, he has gone off on important business. It was\n\nstupid to let Gloucester live after he was blinded. Wherever\n\nhe goes he turns all hearts against us. Edmund, I think, has\n\ngone to end his father’s darkened life out of pity for his\n\nmisery, as well as to determine the strength of the enemy.\n\nOswald I must go after him, madam, with my letter.\n\nRegan Our troops set out tomorrow. Stay with us. It’s\n\ndangerous outside.\n\nOswald I must not, madam. My lady put me on special trust\n\nwith this business.\n\nRegan Why should she write to Edmund? Couldn’t you\n\nconvey her message by word of mouth? Probably some\n\nthings – [ she breaks off, not wishing to express her\n\nsuspicion that  Goneril  and  Edmund  are lovers ] I don’t know\n\nwhat … I’d very much appreciate it … Let me open the\n\nletter.\n\nOswald Madam, I’d rather –\n\nRegan I know your lady doesn’t love her husband. I’m sure of\n\nthat. When she was here recently, she gave knowing\n\nglances and meaningful looks to noble Edmund. I know you\n\nhave her confidence.\n\nOswald I, madam?\n\nRegan I know what I’m talking about. You have, I know it.\n\nTherefore I advise you: take note of this. My lord is dead.\n\nEdmund and I have come to an understanding, and he’s\n\nmore available to me than he is to your lady. You know what\n\nI’m getting at. If you find him, give him this. [ She hands\n\nOswald  a ring ] And when your mistress hears what I’ve told\n\nyou, I suggest you advise her to act sensibly. So, goodbye.\n\nIf you happen to hear of that blind traitor, there’s promotion\n\nfor the one who ends his life.\n\nOswald If only I could meet him, madam. I’d show where my\n\nloyalty lies.\n\nRegan Fare you well.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 6\n\nThe countryside near Dover.  Gloucester  enters, led by  Edgar,  who is now dressed like a peasant.\n\nGloucester When shall I reach the top of the hill?\n\nEdgar You’re climbing up it now. Notice how hard it’s getting.\n\nGloucester I think the ground is level.\n\nEdgar It’s horribly steep. Listen! Do you hear the sea?\n\nGloucester Frankly, no.\n\nEdgar Well then, your other senses are growing imperfect\n\nthrough the pain in your eyes.\n\nGloucester It may be so, indeed. I think your voice is altered,\n\nand that you speak more coherently than you used to.\n\nEdgar You’ve got it wrong. I’m the same as before except for\n\nmy clothing.\n\nGloucester I think you are better spoken.\n\nEdgar Come on, sir. Here’s the place. Stand still. [ He has\n\nstopped in the middle of a field, though he pretends he is at\n\nthe edge of a cliff ] How frightening and dizzy-making it is to\n\nlook so far down! The crows and jackdaws that fly a\n\nmiddling height look hardly as big as beetles. Halfway down\n\nthere’s a man gathering samphire [ a European plant ]. What\n\na dreadful job! He looks to me no bigger than his head. The\n\nfishermen walking on the beach look like mice, and that tall\n\nship at anchor over there is reduced to the size of her tender,\n\nand her tender a buoy almost too small to be seen. The\n\nmurmuring waves that agitate the countless, useless\n\npebbles cannot be heard from this height. I’ll look no more,\n\nin case it turns my head, and blurred sight makes me topple\n\nheadlong down.\n\nGloucester Put me where you are.\n\nEdgar Give me your hand. You are now within a foot of the\n\nextreme edge. For all the world, I wouldn’t jump up and\n\ndown.\n\nGloucester Let go my hand. Here, friend, is another purse. In\n\nit there’s a jewel worth a lot to a poor man. May good\n\nfortune see you enjoy it! Go further away. Say goodbye, and\n\nlet me hear you go.\n\nEdgar [ pretending to go ] Goodbye, good sir.\n\nGloucester With all my heart.\n\nEdgar [ aside ] The reason I’m trifling with his misery like this is\n\nto cure it.\n\nGloucester [ kneeling ] Oh, you mighty gods! I renounce the\n\nworld, and in your sight uncomplainingly rid myself of my\n\ngreat suffering. Even if I could bear it longer, and not fall\n\ninto quarreling with your great and absolute decrees, the\n\nsmoldering wick and hatred end of my life would fizzle out.\n\nIf Edgar is alive, oh, bless him! [ To  Edgar ] Now, fellow:\n\nfare you well.\n\n[ He throws himself forward, as if over a cliff ]\n\nEdgar [ pretending to be at a distance ] Gone, sir. Farewell!\n\n[ To himself ] Possibly one can be deluded into death when\n\nthere’s no will to live. If he had been where he thought he\n\nwas, thought would by now be a thing of the past. Is he\n\nalive, or dead? [ To  Gloucester ] Hello, sir! Friend! Do you\n\nhear me, sir? Speak! [ To himself ] He might indeed have\n\ndied. [ Gloucester  stirs ] But he’s recovering! [ Now\n\npretending he is a fisherman at the foot of the cliff ] Who are\n\nyou, sir?\n\nGloucester Go away, and leave me to die.\n\nEdgar If you’d been anything other than gossamer, feathers,\n\nor air, you’d be shattered like an egg after falling from such\n\na height! But you are breathing; you are solid; you aren’t\n\nbleeding; you can speak; you are in one piece. You have\n\nfallen more than the height of ten ships’ masts. It’s a\n\nmiracle you are alive. Say something more.\n\nGloucester Have I fallen, or not?\n\nEdgar From the very top of this chalky cliff. Look right up\n\nthere: you can’t see or hear the shrill-voiced lark at that\n\ndistance. Just look up!\n\nGloucester Alas, I have no eyes. Is wretchedness deprived of\n\nthe benefit of ending itself by death? It was some small\n\ncomfort when misery could thwart the anger of a tyrant, and\n\nfrustrate his lofty plans.\n\nEdgar Give me your arm. [ He helps  Gloucester  to stand ] Up,\n\nso; how goes it? Can you feel your legs? You are standing\n\nup!\n\nGloucester Only too well, too well.\n\nEdgar This is quite remarkable. On the edge of the cliff, what\n\nwas that object who left you?\n\nGloucester A poor unfortunate beggar.\n\nEdgar As I stood here below, I thought his eyes were two full\n\nmoons. He had a thousand noses. He had horns that were\n\nbent and twisted like the wavy sea. It was some devil.\n\nTherefore, you lucky old man, assume that the righteous\n\ngods, who are revered for doing the impossible, have\n\npreserved you.\n\nGloucester I remember now. In future, I’ll bear suffering till it\n\ndecides I’ve endured enough, and lets me die. That thing\n\nyou spoke of I thought was a man. It often said, “The fiend,\n\nthe fiend.” He led me to that place.\n\nEdgar Put your mind at rest. But who comes here?\n\n[ Lear  enters, ornately dressed with wild flowers. He has lost\n\nhis reason ]\n\nNo man in his right mind would ever get himself up like this.\n\nLear No, they can’t accuse me of counterfeiting. I am the\n\nKing himself!\n\nEdgar What a heartbreaking sight!\n\nLear In matters of that sort, art takes second place to the real\n\nthing! [ As if to a recruit ] There’s your King’s shilling!\n\n[ Jumping from one delusion to another ] That man there\n\nhandles his bow like a scarecrow. Draw that bowstring out\n\na full arm’s length! [ He spots something at his feet ] Look,\n\nlook, a mouse! Sh! Sh! This piece of toasted cheese will\n\ncatch it. [ He tears off an imaginary chunk, then suddenly\n\nthrows it to the ground ] There’s my gauntlet; I’d challenge a\n\ngiant even. [ He’s a general now ] Bring up the pikemen! [ He\n\nfollows an imaginary arrow in its flight ] Oh, well-flown, bird!\n\nA bull’s eye, a bull’s eye! Swish! [ Noticing  Edgar ] Give the\n\npassword.\n\nEdgar Sweet marjoram.\n\nLear Pass.\n\nGloucester I know that voice.\n\nLear [ peering at him ] Aha, Goneril with a white beard! They\n\nflattered me like fawning dogs, and told me I was a shrewd\n\none even before I grew my first beard. To think they said\n\n“Yes” and “No” to everything I said! “Yes” and “No” isn’t\n\nsound theology. When the rain came to drench me once,\n\nand the wind made me shiver, when the thunder wouldn’t\n\nstop when I told it to, then I rumbled them; that’s when I\n\nsmelt them out! Pah, they’re not men of their words. They\n\ntold me I was all-powerful. It was a lie. I’m not immune from\n\nsickness.\n\nGloucester The tone of that voice I well remember. Are you\n\nnot the King?\n\nLear Yes, every inch a king! When I look hard at a man, see\n\nhow he trembles! I pardon that man’s life. What was your\n\ncrime? Adultery? You shall not die. Die for adultery? No,\n\neven the wren goes to it, and the little gold-colored fly does\n\nit in front of my eyes. Let copulation prosper; Gloucester’s\n\nbastard son was kinder to his father than my legitimate\n\ndaughters. Get at it, lust, flat out. I need soldiers! Look at\n\nthat innocent-looking female, whose face suggests she’s\n\nfrigid, who looks so goody-goody, who deplores all sexy\n\ntalk; polecats and stallions aren’t so hungry for it! From the\n\nwaist down they’re animals, albeit they’re women higher up.\n\nThe gods hold sway down to the belt; below is all the\n\ndevil’s. There is hell; there is darkness; there is the\n\nsulphurous pit – burning, scalding; stench, corruption! [ His\n\nmind is tormented with horror and repugnance ] Ugh, ugh,\n\nugh! Pah! Pah! [ To  Gloucester ] Give me an ounce of\n\nperfume, dear chemist, to sweeten my imagination! There’s\n\nsome money for you.\n\nGloucester Oh, let me kiss your hand.\n\nLear Let me wipe it first. It smells of death.\n\nGloucester Oh, what a ruin of a man! So too will the universe\n\ncome to its end. Do you know me?\n\nLear I remember your eyes well enough. Are you squinting at\n\nme? No, do your worst, blind sinfulness; I won’t indulge.\n\n[ Obsessed with  Gloucester’s  affliction ] Read this challenge.\n\nNote how it’s written.\n\nGloucester If all the letters were suns, I could not see them.\n\nEdgar [ aside ] I wouldn’t believe this if I heard about it. But it’s\n\na fact, and my heart breaks at it.\n\nLear Read.\n\nGloucester What, with holes for eyes?\n\nLear Oh, ho! Is that your game? No eyes in your head, and no\n\nmoney in your purse? Sad for your eyes; bad for your purse.\n\nBut that’s the way of the world, you see.\n\nGloucester I see by the feel of things.\n\nLear What, are you mad? A man doesn’t need eyes to see\n\nhow this world goes. Look with your ears. See how that\n\nmagistrate rebukes that humble thief. A word in your ear:\n\nSwitch places, and – take your choice – which is the\n\nmagistrate, which the thief? You’ve seen a farmer’s dog\n\nbark at a beggar?\n\nGloucester Yes, sir.\n\nLear And the man run away from the cur? That symbolizes\n\nAuthority: a dog is obeyed when it’s got an official position.\n\n[ Addressing an imaginary officer of the law ] You rascally\n\nconstable, stay your blood-stained hand! Why are you\n\nlashing that whore? Strip the skin off your own back; you’re\n\nlusting for the very thing you’re whipping her for. The big\n\ncrook hangs the petty one. The petty crimes of the poor are\n\nalways obvious; robes and fur-lined gowns hide everything.\n\nCover sin with gold armor, and the strong lance of justice\n\nshatters on contact. Cover it with rags, and the puny\n\nweapon of a pigmy will pierce through it. Nobody sins:\n\nnobody, I say, nobody; I’ll vouch for them. Take my word for\n\nit, my friend: I who have the power to silence all\n\nprosecutors. Get youself glass eyes. Like a vile opportunist,\n\npretend to see what you actually cannot. [ As if talking to\n\nhis valet ] Now, now, now, now – pull off my boots! Harder,\n\nharder; that’s right.\n\nEdgar [ aside ] Sense and nonsense combined. Sanity in\n\nmadness!\n\nLear If you want to weep for my misfortunes, have my eyes. I\n\nknow you well enough. Your name is Gloucester. You must\n\nbe patient. We came crying into this world; you know, the\n\nfirst time that we smell the air we wail and cry. I’ll preach to\n\nyou – listen.\n\nGloucester Alas, alas the day!\n\nLear When we are born, we cry because we’ve come to this\n\ngreat stage of fools. [ He stands on a tree stump to continue\n\nhis “sermon” ] This is a good mounting-block! It would be\n\nan ingenious idea to shoe a troop of horses with felt. I must\n\ngive it a try. And when I’ve crept up behind these\n\nsons-in-law, then [ he jumps down, shouting ] kill, kill, kill,\n\nkill, kill, kill!\n\n[ A  Gentleman  enters, with Attendants ]\n\nGentleman Oh, here he is. Take hold of him. Sir, your most\n\ndear daughter –\n\nLear [ thinking he has been captured in war ] No rescue? What,\n\na prisoner? I was born unlucky. Treat me well. You shall\n\nhave ransom. Get me doctors. My head’s split.\n\nGentleman You shall have whatever you want.\n\nLear No supporters? Just me alone? Why, this would make a\n\nman cry salt tears, to have his eyes used for garden\n\nwatering-cans, yes, and to lay the dust of autumn. I shall die\n\nsplendidly, like a bridegroom all dressed up. What, I’ll be\n\njovial! Come, come, I am a king, gentlemen. Do you realize\n\nthat?\n\nGentleman You are a royal person, and we obey you.\n\nLear Then there’s still hope. Come, if you want it, you’ll have\n\nto run for it! [ He runs off , making noises like a hunter ] Sa,\n\nsa, sa, sa! [ The Attendants pursue him ]\n\nGentleman A most pitiful sight even if it featured the lowliest\n\nof wretches: it’s beyond words when it involves a king! You\n\nhave one daughter who redeems nature from the universal\n\ncurse her two sisters have brought upon it.\n\nEdgar Greetings, sir!\n\nGentleman Sir, my compliments: what can I do for you?\n\nEdgar Have you heard anything, sir, of an impending battle?\n\nGentleman Certainly; it’s common knowledge. Everyone’s\n\nheard about it who isn’t deaf.\n\nEdgar But, if I may ask: how near is the other army?\n\nGentleman Very near, and advancing swiftly. We expect to\n\nsee the main body any hour now.\n\nEdgar Thank you, sir: that’s all.\n\nGentleman Though the Queen is here for special reasons, her\n\narmy has moved on.\n\nEdgar I thank you, sir.\n\n[ The  Gentleman  leaves ]\n\nGloucester You ever-merciful gods, take my life. Don’t let my\n\nevil side tempt me again to die before it’s your will!\n\nEdgar Well prayed, father.\n\nGloucester Now, good sir, who are you?\n\nEdgar A very poor man, broken by misfortune. Experience of\n\nsorrow has predisposed me toward pity. Give me your\n\nhand. I’ll lead you to some shelter.\n\nGloucester Hearty thanks. May the bounty and blessing of\n\nheaven reward you, in addition to my gratitude.\n\n[ Oswald  enters ]\n\nOswald A man with a price on his head! Most fortunate! That\n\neyeless head of yours was preordained to make my fortune!\n\nYou miserable old traitor, think of your sins. [ He draws his\n\nsword from its scabbard ] The sword is out that must\n\ndestroy you.\n\nGloucester [ ready to die ] Thrust hard with your friendly hand.\n\n[ Edgar  steps forward in his father’s defense ]\n\nOswald You impertinent peasant, how dare you defend an\n\noutlawed traitor? Go, before you suffer the same fate as\n\nhim. Let go his arm.\n\nEdgar [ assuming a regional accent ] I’ll not let go, sir, without\n\na better reason.\n\nOswald Let go, wretch, or you’ll die.\n\nEdgar Good gentleman, be on your way, and let us poor folk\n\nmove on. If I could have been cheated out of my life, I’d\n\nhave lost it weeks ago. No, don’t come near the old man.\n\nKeep off, I tell you, or I’ll test which is harder – your head or\n\nmy stick. That’s the truth.\n\nOswald Get away, you slob!\n\nEdgar I’ll pick your teeth for you, sir. Come on, I’m not scared\n\nof your sword-thrusts. [ They fight;  Edgar  knocks  Oswald\n\ndown ]\n\nOswald Wretch, you’ve killed me. Peasant, take my purse. If\n\nyou ever hope to prosper, bury my body. Give the letters\n\nyou’ll find on me to Edmund, Earl of Gloucester. Find him on\n\nthe English side. Oh, such untimely death! Death … [ He\n\ndies ]\n\nEdgar I know you well. An unscrupulous villain, as dutiful in\n\nserving the vices of your mistress as wickedness could\n\ndesire.\n\nGloucester What, is he dead?\n\nEdgar Sit down, father, and rest. Let’s see what’s in these\n\npockets; the letters he referred to might do me some good.\n\n[ As he searches, he answers  Gloucester’s  question ] He’s\n\ndead. I am only sorry he didn’t have some other executioner.\n\n[ He finds the letter ] Let’s see. [ He breaks the seal ] If I may,\n\ndear wax! Don’t say this is bad manners; to know what’s in\n\nour enemies’ minds, we rip their hearts. Ripping open their\n\nletters is more lawful. [ He reads the contents aloud ]\n\nRemember our mutual vows. You’ll have many\n\nchances to do away with him. If you’ve got the\n\ndetermination, there’ll be ample time and opportunity.\n\nIf he comes back the victor, we shall have achieved\n\nnothing. Then I would be his prisoner, and our marital\n\nbed would be my jail. Save me from the intimate\n\nhorror of that, and assure yourself of physical\n\ncontentment.\n\nYour wife, as I would wish, and\n\nDevoted lover,\n\nGoneril.\n\nOh, how infinite is woman’s lust! A plot to kill her virtuous\n\nhusband, and my brother to replace him! [ Addressing\n\nOswald ] Here, in these sands, the unholy burial-place of\n\nmurderous lechers, I’ll cover your body up. When the time is\n\nripe, I’ll show this wicked letter to the Duke, whose life is\n\nthreatened. It’s fortunate for him that I can report both your\n\ndeath and the business you were about.\n\nGloucester The King is mad. How obstinate my mind is, that I\n\nshould stay sane, and be conscious of my great distress! It\n\nwould be better if I were mad; then my thoughts and my\n\ngriefs would be separated, and in my fantasies woes would\n\ncease to have any meaning.\n\n[ The sound of drums is heard ]\n\nEdgar Give me your hand. I think I can hear drum-beats in the\n\ndistance. Come, father: I’ll leave you with a friend.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nScene 7\n\nA tent in the French camp.  Cordelia, Kent, Doctor  and a  Gentleman  enter.\n\nCordelia Oh good Kent! How shall I live and work to equal\n\nyour goodness? My life will be too short, and I’ll fail by every\n\nstandard.\n\nKent To be appreciated, madam, is to be overpaid. All I’ve\n\ndescribed is the honest truth, no more, no less, just as it is.\n\nCordelia Change your clothes. These garments are reminders\n\nof those bad times. Please, take them off.\n\nKent With respect, madam, to be recognized now runs\n\ncounter to my plans. I’d ask the favor of your not knowing\n\nme till I think the time is right.\n\nCordelia So be it, my good lord. [ To the  Doctor ] How is the\n\nKing?\n\nDoctor Madam, he’s still sleeping.\n\nCordelia Oh, you kind gods, cure this great fracture in his\n\ntormented mind! Tune the discordant senses of this childlike\n\nfather!\n\nDoctor Would your Majesty allow us to wake the King? He\n\nhas slept long.\n\nCordelia Act according to your knowledge of these things. Do\n\nas you think best. Is he dressed?\n\n[ Lear  enters in a chair carried by Servants ]\n\nGentleman Yes, madam. While he was fast asleep we put\n\nclean clothes on him.\n\nDoctor Be at his side, good madam, when we waken him. I\n\ndo not doubt that he’ll be normal.\n\nCordelia Very well.\n\n[ Soft music is played ]\n\nDoctor [ to the Servants ] Come nearer. Play louder there!\n\nCordelia Oh, my dear father! May my lips convey healing, and\n\nlet this kiss cure the damage that my two sisters have done\n\nto you. [ She kisses him on the forehead ]\n\nKent Kind and dear Princess!\n\nCordelia [ stroking his hair ] Even if they were not of your own\n\nbegetting, these snowy locks would merit pity. Was this a\n\nface to battle with antagonistic winds? To withstand the\n\nthunderbolts of deep-throated thunder? To be in the midst\n\nof flashes of terrifying lightning? To be up at night – poor\n\nhopeless one! – with this thin head-covering? My enemy’s\n\ndog, even if it had bitten me, would have had a place in\n\nfront of my fire that night. Were you obliged, poor father, to\n\nslum it with swine and homeless vagabonds, in scanty and\n\nmusty-smelling straw? Alas, alas! It’s amazing that your life\n\nand your sanity didn’t succumb together. He is waking.\n\nSpeak to him.\n\nDoctor Madam, do you. It’s best.\n\nCordelia How is my royal lord? How fares your Majesty?\n\nLear It’s wrong of you to take me out of the grave. You are a\n\nsoul in a state of bliss; but I am in hell, tied to a wheel of\n\nfire. My own tears scald like molten lead.\n\nCordelia Sir, do you know me?\n\nLear You are a spirit, I know. Where did you die?\n\nCordelia [ to the  Doctor ] He is still confused.\n\nDoctor He’s hardly awake. Leave him alone a moment.\n\nLear Where have I been? Where am I? Is this real daylight? I\n\nwas mightily deluded. I’d die with pity to see someone else\n\nlike this. I don’t know what to say. I’m not sure these are\n\nmy hands – let’s see. [ He winces as he tests with the point\n\nof a brooch ] I feel this pin-prick. I wish I could sort things\n\nout.\n\nCordelia Oh, look at me, sir, and hold your hand in blessing\n\nover me!\n\n[ Lear  looks at her, then falls at her feet ]\n\nNo, sir: you must not kneel!\n\nLear Please, do not mock me. I am a very foolish old man, in\n\nhis dotage; over 80 years old, not an hour more or less. To\n\ntell you frankly, I’m afraid I’m not in my right mind. I think I\n\nshould know you and this man, but I am uncertain. I’m\n\nentirely ignorant about what this place is, and even if I try\n\nvery hard I can’t remember these clothes; nor do I know\n\nwhere I stayed last night. Do not laugh at me; as I’m a man,\n\nI think this lady is my child Cordelia.\n\nCordelia And so I am, I am!\n\nLear Are your tears wet? [ He tries them ] Yes, indeed. Please\n\ndon’t weep. If you have poison for me, I will drink it. I know\n\nyou do not love me. Your sisters have, now I remember,\n\ndone me wrong. You have some cause. They have not.\n\nCordelia [ shaking her head, weeping ] No cause, no cause.\n\nLear [ to  Kent ] Am I in France?\n\nKent In your own kingdom, sir.\n\nLear Do not mock me.\n\nDoctor Take comfort, madam. The delirium, you see, has\n\nsubsided in him. It’s dangerous to fill in the gaps in his\n\nmemory. Request him to go in. Don’t trouble him any more\n\ntill he’s calmer.\n\nCordelia Would your Highness like to walk? [ She offers her\n\narm ]\n\nLear You must be patient with me. Please now: forget and\n\nforgive. I am old and foolish.\n\n[ Lear, Cordelia, Doctor  and Attendants leave ]\n\nGentleman Is it a fact that the Duke of Cornwall was killed\n\nlike that?\n\nKent Absolutely, sir.\n\nGentleman Who has taken command of his people?\n\nKent The bastard son of Gloucester, so it’s said.\n\nGentleman They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl\n\nof Kent in Germany.\n\nKent Rumors come and go. We must prepare. The armies of\n\nthe kingdom will soon be here.\n\nGentleman The battle is likely to be a bloody one. Farewell, sir.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nKent The full stop at the end of my life will be placed for good\n\nor ill according to the outcome of today’s battle.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nAct five\n\nScene 1\n\nThe British camp at Dover. Enter  Edmund, Regan,  Officers, Soldiers and others .\n\nEdmund [ to an Officer ] Find out from the Duke if he’s sticking\n\nto his last plan, or whether he’s had any reason to alter\n\ncourse. He changes his mind all the time and is full of\n\ninsecurity. Bring his final decision.\n\n[ The Officer salutes and goes ]\n\nRegan Our sister’s steward has come to some harm.\n\nEdmund I’m afraid so, madam.\n\nRegan Now, sweet lord, you know that I intend to do you\n\nsome good. Tell me, honestly, even if it’s unpalatable: don’t\n\nyou love my sister?\n\nEdmund In an honorable way.\n\nRegan [ trying to be delicate about personal matters ] But have\n\nyou never trespassed on my brother-in-law’s territory?\n\nEdmund That thought is worrying you.\n\nRegan I suspect you may have got very close to her … gone\n\nall the way …\n\nEdmund No, on my honor, madam!\n\nRegan I couldn’t tolerate her. Dear my lord, don’t be intimate\n\nwith her.\n\nEdmund Don’t worry about me. [ A drum sounds ] Here she is,\n\nwith the Duke her husband!\n\n[ Albany  and  Goneril  enter, followed by Soldiers ]\n\nGoneril [ aside ] I’d rather lose the battle than have my sister\n\ncome between him and me.\n\nAlbany [ bowing politely to  Regan ] Our very loving sister:\n\ngreetings. [ To  Edmund ] Sir, I hear this: the King has gone to\n\nhis daughter, along with others forced to defect as a result\n\nof our harsh rule. I’ve never had any stomach for shady\n\nmatters. As for this business, it concerns us only because\n\nFrance invades our land: not that we wish to confront the\n\nKing and those others whose genuine grievances, I fear,\n\nmake them opposed to us.\n\nEdmund Sir, you speak nobly.\n\nRegan Why bother to say all this?\n\nGoneril Unite against the enemy; these family and private\n\nquarrels are irrelevant.\n\nAlbany Then let’s consult the experts on our tactics.\n\nEdmund I’ll join you at your tent immediately. [ He makes to\n\nleave ]\n\nRegan Sister, you’ll go with us?\n\nGoneril No.\n\nRegan It’s only right that you should. Go with us.\n\nGoneril [ aside ] Oh, yes. I know your game … [ She suspects\n\nher sister does not trust her alone with  Edmund ] I’ll go.\n\n[ Before anyone can leave , Edgar  enters, disguised ]\n\nEdgar [ to  Albany ] If your Grace would deign to speak to so\n\npoor a man, may I have a word with you?\n\nAlbany [ indicating to the others to carry on ] I’ll catch up with\n\nyou.\n\n[ Edmund, Regan, Goneril,  Officers , Soldiers and Attendants\n\nleave ]\n\nEdgar [ to  Albany ] Before you fight the battle, open this letter.\n\nIf you win, sound the trumpet to summon me. Humble\n\nthough I seem, I can produce a champion who will prove\n\nwhat is said here. If you lose, you won’t be concerned about\n\nworldly things, and there all matters will end. Good luck!\n\nAlbany Stay till I’ve read the letter.\n\nEdgar I was forbidden to. At the appropriate time, just let the\n\nherald’s trumpet sound, and I’ll appear again.\n\nAlbany Well, fare you well. I’ll read your letter.\n\n[ Edgar  goes ]\n\n[ Edmund  returns ]\n\nEdmund The enemy is in sight. Bring up your troops.\n\n[ Handing  Albany  a note ] Here’s the estimate of their\n\nequipment and numbers, determined by our scouts. You\n\nmust be quick now.\n\nAlbany We’ll rise to the challenge.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nEdmund I have sworn my love to both these sisters. Each is\n\nsuspicious of the other, as those who are stung are wary\n\nof the snake. Which of them shall I have? Both? One? Or\n\nneither? Neither can be enjoyed if both remain alive. To take\n\nthe widow would exasperate, infuriate, her sister Goneril.\n\nBut with her husband still alive, I wouldn’t find it easy to\n\nplay a winning game. So for now we’ll use him as a front\n\nman in the battle. When that’s over, it’s up to her who\n\nwants to be rid of him to work out how to see him off. As\n\nfor the mercy he intends to show Lear and Cordelia, once\n\nthe battle’s over and they are at our mercy, they’ll never see\n\nhis pardon. My interests are best served by action rather\n\nthan thought.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nScene 2\n\nA field between the two camps. Noises of war.  Lear  and  Cordelia  cross the stage with some of their army, and leave.  Edgar  enters with  Gloucester .\n\nEdgar Here, father, shelter in the shade of this hospitable\n\ntree. Pray that right triumphs. If ever I return to you again,\n\nI’ll bring you comforting news.\n\nGloucester Grace go with you, sir!\n\n[ Edgar leaves ]\n\n[ The sounds of war grow louder. A retreat is sounded.\n\nEdgar  returns, dismayed ]\n\nEdgar We must go, old man! Give me your hand. [ He tries to\n\npull  Gloucester  to his feet ] Let’s go! King Lear has lost. He\n\nand his daughter have been captured. Give me your hand.\n\nCome on!\n\nGloucester [ resisting ] No further, sir. A man can die well\n\nenough here.\n\nEdgar What, depressed again? Men must endure dying just as\n\nthey do being born. Being prepared for it is what matters.\n\nCome on.\n\nGloucester That’s true, too.\n\n[ He rises to his feet and they leave ]\n\nScene 3\n\nThe British camp near Dover. Drums and flags herald the entrance of  Edmund  in victory, and  Lear  and  Cordelia  in defeat, as prisoners. Soldiers guard them.\n\nEdmund Some officers take them away. Guard them well, till\n\nthe wishes of our leaders, who will decide their fate, are\n\nknown.\n\nCordelia We are not the first to suffer the worst from the best\n\nof intentions. For you – a suffering King – I am defeated: for\n\nmyself I could have faced ill fortune and won. Shall we see\n\nthese “daughters,” these “sisters”?\n\nLear No, no, no, no! Come, let’s be off to prison. We two,\n\nalone, will sing like birds in a cage. When you ask a blessing\n\nof me, I’ll kneel down and ask your forgiveness. That way\n\nwe’ll live, and pray, and sing; and tell each other tales of\n\ndays gone by; and laugh at courtiers in their fancy clothes;\n\nand hear poor wretches discusss the news from court. And\n\nwe’ll talk with them, too: who has failed, and who\n\nsucceeded; who’s in favor, and who’s out; and – as if we\n\nwere God’s spies – solve the mysteries of the universe. In\n\nthe confines of our prison, we’ll outlast many a gang of\n\nhigh and mighty ones, who come and go by the month.\n\nEdmund [ to the Officers ] Take them away.\n\nLear The gods themselves endorse such sacrifices as yours,\n\nCordelia. [ She starts to weep ] Have I made you cry? [ He\n\nputs his arm around her ] To separate us, a man would need\n\na burning torch from heaven – to drive us apart with fire,\n\nlike a fox smoked from its lair. Wipe your eyes. They’ll rot\n\nbefore they’ll make us weep! We’ll see them starved first!\n\nCome!\n\n[ Lear  and  Cordelia  leave under guard ]\n\nEdmund [ to an  Officer ] Come here, Captain. Listen. [ Giving\n\nhim a paper ] Take this note. Follow them to prison. I’ve\n\npromoted you once already. If you follow these instructions,\n\nyou’ll do well for yourself. Know this: men must take\n\nadvantage of their opportunities. To be tender-hearted is not\n\nbecoming in a soldier. This great assignment brooks no\n\nargument: either say you’ll do it, or prosper by some other\n\nmeans.\n\nOfficer I’ll do it, my lord.\n\nEdmund Get on with it then. Consider yourself lucky when\n\nyou’ve done it. Note – I say immediately. Carry it out\n\naccording to my instructions.\n\nOfficer I can’t pull a cart, or live on dried oats like a horse:\n\nso if it’s man’s work, I’ll do it.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\n[ Trumpets sound. Enter  Albany, Goneril, Regan,  Officers\n\nand Soldiers ]\n\nAlbany [ to  Edmund ] Sir, you’ve shown your valiant side\n\ntoday, and fortune has taken care of you. You have the\n\ncaptives who were our enemies in today’s battle: I require\n\nthem from you, to do with them what their deserts, and our\n\nsafety, shall equally determine.\n\nEdmund Sir, I thought it appropriate to send the old and\n\nmiserable King to some confinement, under guard. The\n\nemotional appeal of his age, and even more so his title,\n\ncould win the hearts of the common people, and turn\n\nagainst us the lances of the conscripted soldiers under our\n\ncommand. With him I sent the Queen, for the same reason.\n\nThey are ready tomorrow, or later, to appear wherever you\n\nintend to hold your trial. Right now, we sweat and bleed.\n\nFriend has lost friend. Even the best of causes can be\n\nmisjudged by injured parties acting in the heat of passion.\n\nThe issue of Cordelia and her father requires a more suitable\n\nplace.\n\nAlbany Sir, just a moment. I regard you as a subject in this\n\nwar – not as an equal.\n\nRegan It’s up to us to decide how to rank him. I think our\n\nwishes might have been consulted before you had said so\n\nmuch. He led our armies, and acted with the authority of my\n\nrank and person. Such representation might well stand up\n\nand call itself your equal.\n\nGoneril Not so fast. He ranks higher in his own right than\n\nbecause of any titles you have given him!\n\nRegan In exercising my rights, with my approval, he equates\n\nwith the best.\n\nAlbany That would only be so if he married you.\n\nRegan Many a true word is spoken in jest!\n\nGoneril [ sarcastically ] Well, well, well … That’s seeing\n\nthings straight!\n\nRegan Madam, I am not well: otherwise I’d give you a piece\n\nof my mind. [ To  Edmund ] General, take my soldiers, my\n\nprisoners, my inheritance. Do as you wish with them, and\n\nme. I surrender myself: may the world be witness that I\n\nhereby create you my lord and master.\n\nGoneril Do you intend to marry him?\n\nAlbany [ rebuking his wife sharply ] It’s not for you to say yes\n\nor no!\n\nEdmund Or you, lord –\n\nAlbany Bastard, it is!\n\nRegan [to Edmund ] Let the drum sound and proclaim that\n\nwhat is mine, is yours.\n\nAlbany Hold it: listen to reason! Edmund, I arrest you for\n\ncapital treason; and as your accessory [ he points to\n\nGoneril ], this deceptively beautiful serpent. [ To  Regan ] As\n\nfor your claim, fair sister, I rule it out of order in the interests\n\nof my wife. She’s the one who is under contract to this lord,\n\nand I – her husband – contradict your banns. If you want to\n\nmarry, address your proposals to me. My lady is already\n\nspoken for.\n\nGoneril Such drama!\n\nAlbany You are armed, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound. If\n\nno one appears to prove in combat with you your vile,\n\nundeniable and many treasons, there is my challenge! [ He\n\nthrows down a gauntlet ] I’ll prove it on peril of your life,\n\nbefore ever I break bread again, that you are in every way\n\nwhat I have here described you.\n\nRegan [ holding her forehead ] Sick, oh, I’m sick!\n\nGoneril [ aside ] If not, I’ll never trust poison.\n\nEdmund There’s my response. [ He throws down his own\n\ngauntlet in exchange ] No matter who he is that calls me\n\ntraitor, he lies like a villain! Let the trumpet sound a call.\n\nWhoever dares to come forward, I will defend my truth and\n\nhonor against him, against you, and against anybody.\n\nAlbany [ calling ] A herald, there!\n\nEdmund A herald there, a herald!\n\nAlbany Trust to your personal valor, because your soldiers –\n\nall levied in my name – have accepted their discharge\n\nfrom me.\n\nRegan [ about to fall ] I’m feeling worse.\n\nAlbany She isn’t well. Convey her to my tent. [ Officers\n\nsupport her and lead her out ]\n\n[ A  Herald  enters ]\n\nCome here, herald. Let the trumpet sound, and read this\n\nout. [ He hands over  Edgar’s  challenge ]\n\nOfficer Sound, trumpet! [ A trumpet sounds ]\n\nHerald [ reading ] If any man of rank or distinction, presently\n\nenlisted in the army, will maintain that Edmund, supposed\n\nEarl of Gloucester, is an all-around traitor, let him appear by\n\nthe third sound of the trumpet. He will defend himself\n\nboldly.\n\nSound!\n\n[ The trumpet sounds for the first time ]\n\nAgain!\n\n[ The second trumpet sounds ]\n\nAgain!\n\n[ The third trumpet sounds. There is a pause, and then an\n\nanswering trumpet is heard from nearby.  Edgar  enters,\n\narmed, preceded by a trumpeter ]\n\nAlbany [ to the  Herald ] Ask him what is his purpose in\n\nappearing upon the trumpet call.\n\nHerald Who are you? Your name? Your rank? Why do you\n\nrespond to this summons?\n\nEdgar Know that my name is not on record. Treason has\n\ndestroyed it. Yet I am as noble as the adversary I come to\n\nfight.\n\nAlbany Who is that adversary?\n\nEdgar Who represents Edmund, Earl of Gloucester?\n\nEdmund [ stepping forward ] He himself. What have you to say\n\nto him?\n\nEdgar Draw your sword, so that, if what I have to say offends\n\na noble heart, your valor may bring you justice. Here is\n\nmine. [ He draws his sword from its scabbard ] Behold! To\n\ndraw it is the privilege of my rank, my vows, and my knight-\n\nhood. I declare – notwithstanding your strength, position,\n\nyouth, and eminence, despite your victorious sword, your\n\nbrand-new good fortune, your valor and your\n\ncourage – that you are a traitor! You have betrayed your\n\ngods, your brother and your father. You have conspired\n\nagainst this illustrious high-born prince, and from the top of\n\nyour head to the dust below your feet, you are a most\n\ninfamous traitor! Deny it, and this sword, this arm, and my\n\nbest endeavors are determined to prove to that heart of\n\nyours, to which I speak, that you lie!\n\nEdmund Common sense tells me I should ask your name. But\n\nas your exterior looks so good and valiant, and because your\n\nspeech has a touch of good breeding about it, though I\n\ncould with all propriety postpone this combat – according to\n\nthe rules of knighthood – this I disdainfully refuse to do. I\n\nthrow these accusations of treason back at you, together\n\nwith the hateful-as-hell charge of lying. Though right now\n\nthey pass you by unscathed, my sword will thrust them\n\nhome where they belong, and put them to rest forever.\n\nTrumpets, speak!\n\n[ Edmund  and  Edgar  fight.  Edmund  falls, wounded ]\n\nAlbany Save him! Save him!\n\nGoneril This is trickery, Gloucester. By the code of arms, you\n\nwere not obliged to fight with an unknown enemy. You are\n\nnot defeated, but cheated and deceived!\n\nAlbany Shut your mouth, woman, or I’ll stop it with this\n\nletter. [ It is  Goneril’s  to  Edmund,  the one which  Edgar  found\n\non  Oswald  in Act 4 Scene 6. To  Edgar ] Hold your sword, sir.\n\n[ To  Goneril ] Wicked beyond all words: read your own evil!\n\n[ Goneril  tries to grab the paper ] No snatching, lady! I\n\nsuspect you know what it is.\n\nGoneril What if I do? The law belongs to me, not you. Who\n\ncould prosecute me for it?\n\nAlbany How utterly monstrous! Oh! Do you know this letter?\n\nGoneril [ hysterical now ] Don’t ask me what I know!\n\n[ She leaves, distraught ]\n\nAlbany Follow her. She’s desperate. Take charge of her.\n\n[ An Officer leaves ]\n\nEdmund [ to  Albany ] What you have charged me with, I have\n\ndone: and more, much more. Time will reveal all. It’s over\n\nnow, and so am I. [ To  Edgar ] But who are you, who has the\n\nadvantage over me? If you are noble, I forgive you.\n\nEdgar Let’s exchange courtesies. I am no less noble than you\n\nare, Edmund. If I’m more, you have wronged me all the\n\nmore. My name is Edgar, and I’m your father’s son. The\n\ngods are just. They use the vices we take pleasure in as the\n\nmeans to punish us; conceiving you cost him his eyes.\n\nEdmund You’ve said right. It’s true. The wheel of fortune has\n\nturned a full circle. I am back at the bottom.\n\nAlbany [ to  Edgar ] I thought your very walk suggested a royal\n\nnobleness. My welcome to you. [ They embrace in soldierly\n\nfashion ] May sorrow be my lot if ever I hated you or your\n\nfather.\n\nEdgar Wise prince, I know that.\n\nAlbany Where did you hide yourself? How did you know\n\nabout your father’s sufferings?\n\nEdgar By nursing them, my lord. Listen to a brief story, and\n\nwhen I’ve told it, would that my heart would burst! To\n\nescape the threat of death that was so close upon me – oh,\n\nhow sweet life is, in that we suffer the pain of death by the\n\nhour rather than die suddenly! – I learned to dress in the\n\nrags of a madman, and to assume a character that even\n\ndogs despised. And in this clothing I met my father with his\n\nbleeding sockets, his eyes newly blinded. I became his\n\nguide, led him, begged for him, and saved him from despair.\n\nI never, foolishly, revealed myself to him till some\n\nhalf hour ago, when I was in armor. Not certain of this\n\nfortunate outcome, though hoping for it, I asked his\n\nblessing, and told him of my journeying from first to last. But\n\nhis injured heart, alas, too weak to carry the strain, torn\n\nbetween the two extremes of passion – joy and\n\ngrief – burst with happiness.\n\nEdmund This speech of yours has touched me, and it could\n\nperhaps do some good. Proceed. You look as though you\n\nhave more to say.\n\nAlbany [ to  Edgar ] If there’s more to report that’s more\n\nharrowing, keep it to yourself. I’m almost at the point of\n\ntears, hearing of this.\n\nEdgar Those who cannot cope with sorrow would think of\n\nthis as a breaking-point. To add more woe by giving details\n\nwould generate further suffering, and go beyond all bearing.\n\nWhile I was bawling out my grief, a man arrived who, having\n\nseen me in my wretchedness, would have avoided my\n\nloathsome company. But seeing who it was that suffered\n\nso, he wrapped his strong arms around my neck, and\n\nbellowed out as if he’d burst the heavens. He embraced my\n\nfather, and told the most pitiful tale about Lear and himself\n\nthat ever anyone heard. In the telling of it, his grief\n\noverwhelmed him, and his hold on life began to slip. Then\n\nthe trumpet sounded twice; and there I left him,\n\nunconscious.\n\nAlbany But who was this?\n\nEdgar Kent, sir, the banished Kent, who in disguise followed\n\nthe King from whom he was alienated, serving him beyond\n\nthe duties even of a slave.\n\n[ A  Gentleman  enters, carrying a bloodstained knife ]\n\nGentleman Help, help, oh, help!\n\nEdgar What kind of help?\n\n[ The  Gentleman  is too choked to answer ]\n\nAlbany Speak up, man!\n\nEdgar Why this bloodstained knife?\n\nGentleman It’s warm … it’s steaming … it came from the\n\nheart of … [ He cannot find the words ] Oh, she’s dead!\n\nAlbany Who is dead? Speak, man!\n\nGentleman Your wife, sir, your wife. And she has poisoned\n\nyour sister-in-law. She confessed it.\n\nEdmund I was engaged to them both. All three of us will now\n\nbe married at the same time.\n\nEdgar Here comes Kent.\n\n[ Kent  enters ]\n\nAlbany Bring in the bodies, alive or dead.\n\n[ A  Gentleman  leaves ]\n\nThis judgment of heaven, fearful though it is, does not\n\narouse our pity. [ To  Kent ] Oh, is this the man? This is not\n\nthe right time for the normal courtesies.\n\nKent I have come to bid my King and master an everlasting\n\ngood night. Is he not here?\n\nAlbany A serious oversight! Speak, Edmund! Where is the\n\nKing? And where is Cordelia? [ The bodies of  Goneril  and\n\nRegan  are brought in ] Do you see this, Kent?\n\nKent Alas: what’s caused this?\n\nEdmund So Edmund was indeed loved! One poisoned the\n\nother for my sake, and afterwards killed herself.\n\nAlbany Indeed so. Cover their faces.\n\nEdmund I pant for life. I mean to do some good, in spite of my\n\nnature. Send quickly – hurry now! – to the castle. I’ve given\n\norders for the deaths of Lear and Cordelia. Get there in time.\n\nAlbany Run – run! Oh, run!\n\nEdgar To whom, my lord? Who is in charge? Send your token,\n\nindicating a reprieve.\n\nEdmund A good idea: take my sword. Give it to the captain.\n\nEdgar [ passing the sword to an Officer ] Hurry, on your life!\n\n[ The Officer runs off ]\n\nEdmund [ to  Albany ] He has orders from your wife and me to\n\nhang Cordelia in the prison, and to say her despair led to her\n\nsuicide.\n\nAlbany The gods protect her! [ To Servants ] Take him away\n\nfor the moment. [ Edmund  is carried off ]\n\n[ Lear  enters, with  Cordelia  dead in his arms ]\n\nLear Howl, howl, howl! Oh, you are men of stone! If I\n\nhad your tongues and eyes, I’d use them so the roof of\n\nheaven would crack! She’s gone forever. I know when one\n\nis dead, and when one lives. She’s as dead as earth. Lend\n\nme a mirror. If her breath will mist or stain the glass, why,\n\nthen she lives!\n\nKent Is this the end of the world?\n\nEdgar Or a copy of that horror?\n\nAlbany May the heavens fall, and all things cease!\n\nLear [ testing to see whether  Cordelia  is breathing ] This\n\nfeather moves! She’s alive! If so, it is a piece of luck that\n\ncancels out all the sorrows that I have ever felt.\n\nKent [ kneeling ] Oh, my good master!\n\nLear [ pushing him aside anxiously ] Go away!\n\nEdgar [ explaining ] It’s the noble Kent, your friend.\n\nLear Damn you! Murderers, traitors, all of you! I might have\n\nsaved her. Now she’s gone forever. Cordelia, Cordelia, stay\n\na while! [ He puts his ear to her lips ] What’s that you say?\n\nHer voice was always soft, gentle and low: an excellent\n\nthing in a woman. [ Proudly ] I killed the wretch who was\n\nhanging you!\n\nOfficer It’s true, my lords: he did.\n\nLear Didn’t I, man? I’ve seen the day when, with my good\n\nsharp sword I would have made them jump! I am old now,\n\nand these ailments of mine get in the way. [ He peers at\n\nKent ] Who are you? My eyes are not as good as they might\n\nbe; I’ll tell you straight –\n\nKent If Fortune should boast of two men she both loved and\n\nhated, we are looking at one of them now.\n\nLear – my sight is poor. [ After a pause ] Aren’t you Kent?\n\nKent I am. Your servant, Kent. Where is your servant called\n\nCaius?\n\nLear [ recognizing the name  Kent  used when disguised ] He’s a\n\ngood fellow, I can tell you that! He’ll fight, and quickly, too!\n\n[ Sadly ] He’s dead and decayed.\n\nKent No, my good lord. I am the man –\n\nLear [ not able to grasp what  Kent  says ] I’ll see to that in a\n\nmoment.\n\nKent – who has followed in your sad steps from the very\n\nbeginning of your declining fortunes.\n\nLear You are welcome here.\n\nKent The very man. All is dreary, dark, and funereal. Your\n\neldest daughters have put an end to themselves, and in\n\nhopeless desperation are dead.\n\nLear [ uncomprehending ] Yes, so I believe.\n\nAlbany He doesn’t know what he is saying. It’s no use our\n\ntalking to him.\n\nEdgar None whatever.\n\n[ An  Officer  enters ]\n\nOfficer Edmund is dead, my lord.\n\nAlbany That’s of small importance here. Lords and noble\n\nfriends, know our intentions. We shall provide what comfort\n\nwe can for this noble ruin of mankind. As for us, we shall\n\nabdicate our absolute power to this old majesty during the\n\nremainder of his life. [ To  Edgar  and  Kent ] As for you: resume\n\nyour rightful places, with such additional titles as your noble\n\ndeeds have more than earned. All friends shall be rewarded\n\nfor their loyalty, and all foes punished as they deserve to be.\n\nOh, look, look!\n\nLear And my poor child is hanged! No, no, no life! Why should\n\na dog, or a horse, or a rat have life, and you no breath at all?\n\nYou’ll come no more: never, never, never, never, never! [ He\n\nstruggles with his collar ] Please, undo this button. [ Albany\n\nhelps him ] Thank you, sir. [ He imagines  Cordelia  is showing\n\nsigns of life ] Do you see this? Look at her – look – her lips!\n\nLook there, look there! [ The excitement overwhelms him,\n\nand he dies ]\n\nEdgar He’s fainted! [ Shaking  Lear ] My lord, my lord!\n\nKent May he suffer no more!\n\nEdgar Come on, my lord!\n\nKent [ drawing him away ] Don’t trouble his parting soul. Let\n\nhim go. Only an enemy would prolong the torture.\n\nEdgar He’s really gone.\n\nKent The surprising thing is that he endured his suffering\n\nso long. He lived on borrowed time.\n\nAlbany Bear them away. General mourning is now our\n\nimmediate concern. [ To  Kent  and  Edgar ] Kindred souls: you\n\ntwo shall rule in this kingdom, to shoulder the burden of our\n\nruined state.\n\nKent [ hinting at his death ] I have a journey to make, sir, soon.\n\nMy master calls me. I must not deny him.\n\nEdgar We must respond to the burdens of these sad times,\n\nand speak frankly, not expediently. The oldest have suffered\n\nmost. We who are young will never see as much as they\n\nhave seen, or live so long.\n\n[ The bodies are all taken up, and everyone leaves\n\nat a dead march ]\n\nActivities\n\nCharacters\n\nSearch the text (either the original or the modern version) to find answers to the following questions.

What does he call upon nature to do?\n\nii his weakness and old age. What is his plea before the justice of the gods?\n\nb Of what is his resolution to “say nothing” an ironic echo?\n\nc i Why might his speech denouncing hypocrites and sinners be said to mark the beginning of his redemption?\n\nii How does his treatment of the Fool confirm that Lear is beginning to look upon his fellow men in a new way?\n\n8 a At the beginning of Act III Scene 3 , in the midst of the storm and suffering from “this tempest in my mind,” Lear’s understanding increases. How is this shown by\n\ni the order in which Lear invites his companions to enter the hovel?\n\nii his thoughts on “poor unaccommodated man”?\n\niii his actions?\n\nb Identify the points at which\n\ni Lear’s “wits begin t’unsettle” in Act III Scene 3 ;\n\nii revenge is replaced by justice as a means of dealing with the “she foxes,” in Act III Scene 6 .\n\nc What do the three “justices” have in common who “try” Goneril and Regan?\n\n9 Lear’s next appearance is in Act IV Scene 6 . He is mad. As a result of his experiences and losing his mind, what has he learned about\n \n10 In Act IV Scene 7 Lear recovers from his madness in the company of Cordelia.\n\na What, according to Kent in Act IV Scene 3 , has kept Lear from Cordelia until now?\n\nb At their reunion, the Doctor observes: “the great rage, you see, is killed in him.” Illustrate the truth of this, from Lear’s awakening to his exit on Cordelia’s arm.\n\n11 The battle over and lost, Lear is a prisoner in Act V Scene 3 . Which of his lines show that he\n\ni has learned humility?\n\nii has rejected the false values of court life?\n\niii has regained his dignity?\n\n12 At the end of the play, Lear enters carrying the dead body of Cordelia.\n\na There is evidence that he has once again retreated from reality as a result of suffering. Give examples.\n\nb What has he done which is reminiscent of Lear in his prime?\n\nc Why is the moment of his death an apt one?\n\nGoneril and Regan\n\n1 Their public speeches near the beginning of Act I Scene 1 contrast sharply with their private ones at the end.\n\na Goneril appears to take flattery as far as it will go in expressing her love for her father.\n\ni How does Regan succeed in topping her?\n\nii At this point, is there any recognizable difference in the characters of the two sisters?\n\nb What evidence is there\n\ni that they have been keeping a critical eye on their father?\n\nii that they do not respect him?\n\niii that they do not appreciate what he has given them?\n\nc From the evidence in this dialogue, and especially the last two lines of the scene, decide which sister is the dominant one.\n\n2 It is to his eldest daughter Goneril that Lear first goes after resigning the throne.\n\na Read Act I Scene 3 , and list\n\ni Lear’s alleged offenses;\n\nii Goneril’s plans for dealing with him.\n\nb What do you deduce about her character?\n\n3 a Goneril challenges Lear in Act I Scene 4 .\n\ni Compare her accusations with those in Act I Scene 3 . Have they changed?\n\nii What is consistent about her manner toward her father?\n\nb She also stands up to her husband, Albany. How is it made clear that she is the dominant partner?\n\n4 In Act IV Scene 1 Regan and her husband visit Gloucester.\n\na How does Regan’s relationship with Cornwall differ from her sister’s with Albany?\n\nb How can we tell that Regan has a prejudiced and distorted attitude toward her father and his knights?\n\nc At this point in the play, how would you describe Regan’s attitude toward Gloucester?\n\n5 a Find evidence in Act II Scene 2 and Act II Scene 4 to confirm Regan’s assertion in Act I Scene 1 : “I am made of that self metal as my sister.”\n\nb i How do the two sisters act in concert in Act II Scene 4 ?\n\nii Which sister seems, on balance, to be the more obsessed with the danger of Lear’s followers?\n\n6 a Both sisters take a life during the course of the play.\n\ni Compare the circumstances and contrast the methods employed by each.\n\nii Is Goneril’s suicide consistent with her character?\n\nb Both sisters fall in love with Edmund.\n\ni Deduce from this the qualities they both admire in a man.\n\nii Examine Goneril’s attitude to her husband in Act I Scene 4 , Act IV Scene 1 , and Act V Scene 3 . What qualities in a man does she despise?\n\nc The two sisters are “jealous of the other, as the stung are of the adder” (Edmund, Act V Scene 1 ).\n\ni Check the meaning of these words in the modern translation, then trace the course of the “jealousy” in Act IV Scene 2 , Act IV Scene 5 , Act V Scene 1 and Act V Scene 3 .\n\nii Both Goneril and Regan are demonstrably bad daughters and bad sisters. One plans to have her husband murdered (check Act IV Scene 2 and Act IV Scene 6 ); the other has a sadistic trait (check Act II Scene 2 and Act III Scene 7 ). Is either less pernicious than the other?\n\nCordelia\n\n1 That Cordelia was Lear’s favorite daughter is confirmed three times in Act I Scene 1 : find the relevant evidence in speeches by\n(a) Goneril; (b) the King of France; (c) Lear himself.\n\n2 That Cordelia is Lear’s most virtuous and loving daughter is confirmed\n\na in Act IV Scene 3 . How does Cordelia’s reported response to the news of Lear’s maltreatment show both her feelings, and her natural disinclination to reveal them in public?\n\nb in Act IV Scene 4 . How does Cordelia show her love both emotionally and practically?\n\nc in Act IV Scene 7 . What examples are there of her (i) goodness (ii) kindness (iii) compassion (iv) tenderness (v) forgiving nature?\n\n3 That Cordelia is loved and respected by others is demonstrated in Act I Scenes 1 and 4\n\na by Kent. How does he compliment her?\n\nb by the King of France. What value does he put upon her?\n\nc by the Fool. What effect does Cordelia’s departure have on him?\n\n4 a Twice in Act I Scene 1 Cordelia refers to her natural reticence. Find the lines, and\n\nb check them against Lear’s description of her speaking voice in Act V Scene 3 . Then\n\nc comment on the aptness of the King of France’s analysis of her character in Act I Scene 1 .\n\n5 In spite of saying so little, and appearing only four times in the play, Cordelia shows she has several very positive characteristics.\n\na She is honest. What is the best example of this?\n\nb She deplores insincerity. How does she make this plain (i) to the Duke of Burgundy? (ii) to her sisters?\n\nc She respects integrity. How do we know she recognizes the goodness of Kent?\n\nd She is loyal. Where does Lear say she has good reason not to be?\n\ne She is philosophical. How is this demonstrated by her last speech in the play?\n\nKent\n\n1 Kent has the first words in the play, and almost the last. In Act I Scene 1 , he is fearlessly outspoken; from his speeches choose\n\na three words or phrases which confirm his loyalty to the King;\n\nb three words or phrases which show his clear understanding of Lear’s wrongheadedness;\n\nc three words or phrases which indicate his understanding of Goneril and Regan.\n\n2 a Outspokenness is also a major characteristic of Kent in disguise. How does this work\n\ni to his advantage in Act I Scene 4 and\n\nii to his disadvantage in Act II Scene 2 ?\n\nb In the latter scene, Cornwall speaks of Kent’s “saucy roughness.” Find examples of this in\n\ni his argument with Oswald;\n\nii his retorts to Cornwall and Regan.\n\n3 Between Act III Scene 1 and Act V Scene 3 , Kent’s role is one of protector and correspondent, working on behalf of Lear’s cause.\n\na In the storm scene ( Act III Scene 6 ) he stands out as being the only rational man at the trial. His suggested cure for Lear’s insanity is the same as the Doctor’s in Act IV Scene 4: what is it?\n\nb In Act III Scene 1 and Act IV Scene 3 , Kent establishes links with Cordelia and the French invading army at Dover. What is said at the beginning of Act IV Scene 3 and the end of Act IV Scene 4 to clear Kent of the charge of treason?\n\n4 What is the evidence in Act V Scene 3 that Kent sees his service to the King as extending beyond the grave?\n\nThe Fool\n\n1 a The Fool first appears in Act I Scene 4 .\n\ni How many times does Lear have to call for him before he appears?\n\nii What is the Knight’s explanation for the Fool’s absence, and what does it tell us about the latter’s feelings?\n\nb Immediately, the Fool begins to jest about foolishness\n\ni to Kent (and again in Act II Scene 4 ). Explain why.\n\nii to Lear. What does he say that merits Kent’s remark: “This is not altogether fool, my lord”?\n\nc Collect further examples of the Fool’s oft-reiterated theme, in this scene and the others in which he appears.\n\n2 a Another of his targets is Truth (and its counterpart, Falsehood). How many references to it can you find in Act I Scene 4 ?\n\nb Find examples of Truth conveyed by means of\n\ni jokes and conundrums;\n\nii songs;\n\niii wise sayings.\n\nc In the circumstances, why does Goneril say he is “more knave than fool”?\n\n3 The Fool’s second appearance, in Act I Scene 5 , follows Lear’s humiliation at the hands of Goneril.\n\na Why do you think the Fool’s first joke is about brains?\n\nb What message is he trying to convey in his jokes about crab-apples, noses, and snails?\n\nc Which of the Fool’s remarks is close to the unvarnished truth?\n\nd Mark the text at points where the Fool diverts Lear from brooding about his troubles.\n\n4 a As Lear becomes more isolated and tormented, the Fool works harder to sustain him, maintaining his pointed jokes, puns and witticisms as the King progresses toward madness. In Act II Scene 4\n\ni How many jokes does he make at Lear’s expense?\n\nii How many at Kent’s?\n\niii Is there a significance in the switch of emphasis?\n\nb As Lear departs into the storm, the Fool is his only companion. According to the Gentleman in Act III Scene 1 , what is his function now?\n\n5 The storm scenes ( Act III Scenes 2 ; 4 ; 6 ) are those in which Lear’s “wits begin to turn” and he goes mad.\n\na The Fool suffers from the same physical discomfort as his master. Which lines in Act III Scene 2 show that they have come close together through hardship?\n\nb What incident in Act III Scene 4 is close enough to farce to relieve the dramatic tension?\n\nc Which line spoken by the Fool in Edgar’s presence emphasizes the leveling effect of their situation?\n\nd How does the Fool’s presence at the mock trial of Goneril and Regan help to bring out the full pathos and tragedy of Lear’s condition?\n\n6 The Fool’s last words in the play (“And I’ll go to bed at noon”) can be interpreted many ways. Here are two of them:\n\na “If you are having your evening meal in the morning, then my bedtime will be noon” (i.e., a straightforward quip).\n\nb “I shall not live much longer” (i.e., using the word “bed” as a euphemism for “grave”).\n\nThose who favor (a) point out that the Fool’s dramatic usefulness is at an end, so Shakespeare gives him no more lines to say. Those who favor (b) say Lear’s “And my poor fool is hanged” ( Act V Scene 3 ) proves that he committed suicide, though the word “fool” could mean “child” and therefore refer to Cordelia.\n\nWhat is your opinion?\n\nGloucester\n\n1 Gloucester opens the play by making light of a “pleasant vice” which resulted in the birth of the illegitimate Edmund. Look up Edgar’s words to the dying Edmund in Act V Scene 3 : show how they confirm the former’s belief that “the gods are just” in dealing with immorality.\n\n2 Edmund describes Gloucester as “a credulous father.” Trace the tricks Edmund uses to deceive Gloucester in Act I Scene 1 and Act II Scene 2 .\n\na Is his success due entirely to his manipulative skills, or have recent events made the old Earl vulnerable?\n\nb Show that Gloucester’s mind is in a state of turmoil after Lear’s abdication.\n\n3 Gloucester seems weak, letting others make decisions for him.\n\na To Edmund, he says “frame the business after your own wisdom” in Act I Scene 2 ; and he refers to Cornwall as “The noble Duke my master” in Act II Scene 1 . What is ironic about his dependence on these two men?\n\nb Consider his protest at the stocking of Kent. Do you think he did all he could in the circumstances?\n\nc Read the dialogue between Lear and Gloucester in Act II Scene 4 concerning Cornwall’s slighting of the King. Does Gloucester’s exit line imply that he lacks the courage to take sides?\n\n4 By Act III Scene 2 Gloucester has had further experience of Goneril and Regan, and time to think.\n\na Explain what is praiseworthy about his resolution.\n\nb Explain what is unfortunate about his choice of confidant.\n\nc Explain how he puts his decision to aid Lear into practice.\n\n5 In Act III Scene 7 Gloucester suffers cruelly for his loyalty.\n\na Illustrate\n\ni his dignity while being threatened;\n\nii his strong moral values.\n\nb Later, in Act IV Scene 1 , he says “I stumbled when I saw.” What is the first truth he learns after losing his sight?\n\n6 Blindness brings despair to Gloucester.\n\na In Act IV Scene 1 , which lines sum up his pessimistic philosophy?\n\nb What is his purpose in seeking to be guided toward Dover?\n\n7 Act IV Scene 6 sees Gloucester, led by Edgar, “at the top of that same hill” which, he is told, overlooks the sea.\n\na Explain why it is necessary for Edgar to mislead his father.\n\nb Choose two statements by Gloucester, one after Edgar’s successful ruse, and one after his meeting with Lear, to show that he has rejected the pessimism of Act IV Scene 1 .\n\nc i On what occasion in Act V Scene 2 does Gloucester relapse into melancholy?\n\nii What observation revives him?\n\n8 Gloucester’s death is reported by Edgar in Act V Scene 3 . What was the cause of it?\n\nEdmund\n\n1 We meet Edmund at the very beginning of the play, when Gloucester speaks for him, and we learn of his illegitimacy. Find two reasons why\n\na he might be forgiven for having a jaundiced view of society;\n\nb he might be forgiven for his subsequent lack of filial loyalty.\n\n2 In his soliloquy in Act I Scene 2 , lines 1–22 Edmund speaks for himself.\n\na To whose “law” does he say his “services are bound”?\n\nb List his arguments for appealing to the gods to “stand up for bastards.”\n\n3 a Edmund’s villainy has a strong element of wit about it. Find examples in Act I Scene 2 , with reference to\n\ni his deception of Gloucester and manipulation of Edgar;\n\nii his skeptical references to astrology;\n\niii his use of irony.\n\nb Which lines summarize his case for intrigue against “a credulous father and a brother noble”?\n\nc In Act II Scene 1 ,\n\ni how many examples of his cunning trickery can you find?\n\nii which of Gloucester’s lines indicate that Edmund has succeeded?\n\niii which lines of Cornwall’s advance his prospects even further?\n\n4 In Act III Scene 5 , Edmund tells Cornwall: “I will perserver in my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore between that and my blood.”\n\na Consider\n\ni what he has previously said in Act III Scene 3 ;\n\nii his behavior in Act III Scene 7 ;\n\niii Regan’s report of his murderous intentions in Act IV Scene 5 .\n\nb Is there any evidence of conflicting loyalty?\n\n5 Both Goneril and Regan fall in love with Edmund.\n\na Find the evidence in Act IV Scene 2 , Act IV Scene 5 , and Act V Scene 1 .\n\nb Decide from Edmund’s soliloquy at the end of Act V Scene 1 how far their love is reciprocated.\n\n6 By the end of the play, Edmund has been both victor and vanquished.\n\na In victory, what is his most wicked deed?\n\nb In defeat, what good does he do “despite of mine own nature”?\n\nc Do the words he utters in his dying moments – “Yet Edmund was beloved” – provide any clue about either his past behavior or his deathbed reformation?\n\nEdgar\n\n1 Edgar plays a number of roles throughout the play.\n\na In Act I Scene 1 he is simply the Earl of Gloucester’s legitimate son. How much older is he than Edmund?\n\nb In Act I Scene 2 he is in disgrace. How does Edmund account for the ease with which this was accomplished?\n\nc By Act II Scene 3 he is Poor Tom: “Edgar I nothing am.”\n\ni Describe his appearance.\n\nii Using the information in Act III Scene 4 , list his sufferings and show why “unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal” as he is.\n\niii Explain why Lear finds him a congenial companion, and how Lear’s suffering helps Edgar endure his own.\n\niv Show from Edgar’s words in Act IV Scene 1 that he has the courage and the philosophy to overcome despair.\n\n2 a Edgar is changed for the better when he appears in Act IV Scene 6 , although he denies this to his blind father.\n\ni From whom did he obtain his superior clothes?\n\nii In what ways is his speech different?\n\nb i What is Edgar’s purpose in “trifling thus with his [i.e., Gloucester’s] despair”?\n\nii Explain his method of procedure.\n\nc Which lines of Gloucester’s prove that the ruse has worked?\n\n3 a In his final role in the play, Edgar is a man of action.\n\ni What is his first valorous deed on behalf of his father in Act IV Scene 6 ?\n\nii What is the second, before the battle, in Act V Scene 1 ?\n\niii What is the third, after the battle?\n\nb i Show from the speeches of Edmund and Albany at the end of the play that Edgar has royal dignity.\n\nii In the Quarto edition of the play (1608), the last lines of King Lear are given to Albany. Do you agree with the Folio editors that the words are more appropriately given to Edgar?\n\nStructure, themes and imagery\n\n1 The play has both a main plot and a subplot. Identify the main characters in each.\n\n2 Show how in each there is\n \n3 Complete the following:\n \n4 The theme that initiates events in the play is that of the generation gap; the relationship of parent and child, and the duties and obligations that flow from the blood-bond. Find examples of parent/child relationships involving\n\n(a) gratitude/ingratitude (b) kindness/cruelty (c) trust/deceit (d) legitimacy/illegitimacy (e) duties/freedoms (f) respect/contempt (g) hatred/love\n\n5 Self-knowledge, and the pursuit of truth, go hand-in-hand with the development of the plot.\n\na Lear goes mad before he comes to his senses. Find examples of his progress from folly to wisdom in the following scenes:\n\n(i) Act I Scene 1 (ii) Act I Scene 4 (iii) Act 2 Scene 4 (iv) Act 3 Scenes 2  and  6 (v) Act 4 Scenes 6  and  7\n\nb Gloucester loses his sight before he can “see.” Trace the stages through which he passes (noting in particular how he learns to accept Edgar’s dictum “Ripeness is all”) in the following scenes:\n\n(i) Act I Scenes 1  and  2 (ii) Act 2 Scene 1 (iii) Act 3 Scenes 3  and  4 (iv) Act 3 Scene 7 (v) Act 4 Scene 1 (vi) Act 4 Scene 6 (vii) Act 5 Scene 2 .\n\n6 a The largest theme of all is that of the nature of man, in terms both of the individual and of the way he behaves (often hypocritically) in organized society. The following speeches are central; they are all spoken by Lear:\n\ni “Reason not the need …” ( Act 2 Scene 4 ). What is “the need”?\n\nii “Let the great gods … find out their enemies now” ( Act 3 Scene 2 ). Who are their enemies?\n\niii “Poor naked wretches …” ( Act 3 Scene 4 ). What is to be learned from them?\n\niv “What, art mad? … harder, harder; so.” ( Act 4 Scene 6 ) What has Lear learned about power, corruption, and the dispensation of justice?\n\nb How many relevant pieces of wisdom can you find among the songs and sayings of the Fool?\n\n7 Animal imagery abounds in King Lear. To convey the inhumanity of human behavior and its similarity to wild life, over sixty different creatures are mentioned. Trace the following to their sources, and explain their significance in the context of the play:\n\n(a) “monster ingratitude” (b) “serpent’s tooth” (c) “wolvish visage” (d) “like a vulture” (e) “most serpent-like” (f) “like rats … like dogs” (g) “those pelican daughters” (h) “rash boarish fangs” (i) “Tigers, not daughters” (j) “be-monster not thy feature” (k) “dog-hearted daughters”.\n\nHow many more can you find?\n\n8 a Look up Gloucester’s speech in Act I Scene 2 : “These late eclipses in the sun and moon….” How many words can you find that imply discord, social breakdown, and fractured relationships?\n\nb “Division” is echoed in figurative expressions throughout the play. Place the following examples in context and explain the force of the imagery:\n\ni “These hot tears which break from me perforce …” ( Act 1 )\n\nii “Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain …” ( Act 2 )\n\niii “Crack Nature’s moulds …” ( Act 3 )\n\niv “She that herself will silver and disbranch from her material sap …” ( Act 4 )\n\nv “The strings of life begin to crack …” ( Act 5 )\n\n9 Imagery based on physical suffering is recurrent in King Lear. The torment endured by Lear and Gloucester, and the savagery of the play as a whole, are reflected in terms of “a human body in anguished movement: tugged, wrenched, beaten, pierced, stung, scourged, dislocated, flayed, gashed, scalded, tortured and finally broken on the rack” (Caroline Spurgeon: Shakespeare’s Imagery).\n\na Trace the following examples to their contexts, and explain their appositeness. They are all from Act One .\n\ni … “wrenched my frame of nature from the fixed place”\n\nii … “Th’untented woundings of a father’s curse Pierce every sense about thee!”\n\niii … “with her nails she’ll flay thy wolvish visage”\n\nb Find further examples, guided by Miss Spurgeon’s list.\n\n10 In his opening address to the court in Act I Scene 1 , Lear says he will “divest” himself of “rule, Interest of territory, cares of state.” Imagery based on clothing (or references to it) can be found throughout the play.\n\na Find examples from speeches by the following:\n\ni France, in Act I Scene 1 ;\n\nii Cornwall, in Act 2 Scene 2 ;\n\niii Lear, in Act 3 Scene 4 ;\n\niv Lear in Act 3 Scene 6 .\n\nb Explain why clothes have a symbolic significance in relation to the play’s major themes.\n\nTextual questions\n\nRead the original Shakespeare and (if necessary) the modern transcription, to gain an understanding of the speeches and extracts below. Then concentrate entirely on the original in answering the questions.\n\n1 Thou, Nature, art my goddess ( Act I Scene 2 )\n\na Edmund has said very little up to this point, and what he has said would accord with customs in polite society. What is the element of shock built into these first words of his soliloquy?\n\nb A soliloquy can either be regarded as “thinking aloud, alone” or “confiding inner thoughts to a wider audience.” If you were playing the part of Edmund, would you treat these lines as private musing, or as an opportunity to address the audience?\n\nc Why is custom said to be “a plague”?\n\nd Why is “moonshines Lag of a brother” more wittily suggestive than “younger than a brother”?\n\ne Edmund repeats “base” five times, “bastard” three times, and “bastardy” and “baseness” once each, all in the space of twenty-two lines. What effect does this have on what in former times would have been a series of words with derogatory connotations?\n\nf What effect on the meaning of “legitimate” does Edmund’s\n\n(i) reference to conception in and out of wedlock and\n\n(ii) repetition of the word as adjective and noun five times have on its normally favorable meaning?\n\ng Why might an audience at this stage in the play’s development side with a character who has announced his villainous intentions?\n\n2 These late eclipses in the sun and moon ( Act I Scene 2 )\n\na Gloucester believes there is an astrological explanation for the troubles of his time. What is Edmund’s viewpoint on the subject?\n\nb “Nature” is a word frequently used throughout the play; here it means “man’s reason.” Collect as many references to nature as you can find, and interpret each one according to the context in which it appears.\n\nc Several items in Gloucester’s catalogue of woe are directly related to the circumstances of the play. Explain each.\n\nd Gloucester uses the word “nothing.” So do Lear and Cordelia in Act I Scene 1 . (i) How many times can you find the word employed in King Lear and (ii) can you explain why it should be so significant a word?\n\n3 I heard myself proclaimed ( Act 2 Scene 3 )\n\na Why “happy” hollow?\n\nb Edgar uses mostly words of one or two syllables in this soliloquy.

Widely considered one of Shakespeare’s greatest tragedies, King Lear tells the story of a king who goes mad after bequeathing his fortune and power to his daughters. It is loosely based on the myth of Leir of Britain, a legendary monarch said to have ruled Ancient Britons in the eighth century B.C.\nThis guide refers to the 1999 Pelican Shakespeare edition. Please note that citations in the Summary section refer to line number rather than page number, so this guide can be used with different editions of the play.", "summary": "Lear, the aging king of an ancient pre-Christian England, decides to retire. He will divide his kingdom between his three daughters, leaving them and their husbands to rule jointly. But before he tells them which portion of land they will receive, Lear demands that they answer one little question: which of them loves him the most? \nLear’s elder daughters, Goneril and Regan, praise their father obsequiously, and he rewards each of them—along with their husbands, Albany and Cornwall—with a third of the kingdom. He saves the best land for his favorite daughter, Cordelia. Cordelia, however, refuses to make a dishonest, toadying display of her love for her father as her sisters have. Outraged at her resistance, Lear curses and disowns her, ignoring the protests of his loyal advisor Kent, whom he exiles for his resistance. The King of France nevertheless marries Cordelia on the strength of her own merits, and Cordelia reluctantly departs, leaving her father in the care of her sisters.\nMeanwhile, Lear’s old friend, the Earl of Gloucester, has his own family troubles. Unbeknownst to him, his illegitimate son Edmund plots to betray his legitimate son Edgar and inherit his father’s title himself. Edmund plays on his father’s short temper and his brother’s trusting nature to trick Gloucester into believing that Edgar plans to kill Gloucester. Pursued by his father’s men, Edgar flees into the wilderness disguised as the mad beggar Poor Tom.\nKent also disguises himself as the rough-and-ready Caius and finds his way back into Lear’s service. He worries that Lear will have more trouble with his daughters than he bargained for, a suspicion shared by Lear’s beloved Fool.\nHaving relinquished his power, Lear finds that his temper tantrums no longer hold much sway over his children. When Goneril objects to his rowdy partying, he violently curses her and moves to Regan’s house. But Regan also refuses to house his drunken knights. The final straw comes when Regan puts the disguised Kent in the stocks, an insult to Lear’s authority. Maddened with rage, Lear runs out onto the wild heath amid a terrible storm. Kent and the Fool follow.\nOut in the storm, Lear loses his mind. As Kent and the Fool try to shelter him, they run into the disguised Edgar in a hovel. Edgar’s “madness” is so affecting that Lear strips naked in imitation of him, gaining a new understanding of the suffering of all the poor people in his kingdom. At last, Lear’s friends manage to get him into the hovel where he falls asleep. Gloucester arrives and warns them they need to leave. As a war for the kingdom brews between Goneril and Regan, the king must be protected quickly. Kent hurries Lear away, and the Fool mysteriously disappears from the play.\nMeanwhile, Edmund betrays Gloucester to the sisters, telling them that Gloucester knows of an invading French army led by Cordelia that intends to restore Lear to the throne. Regan and her husband Cornwall capture Gloucester and vengefully gouge out his eyes. A horrified servant who tries to stop them mortally wounds Cornwall in a struggle, leaving Regan open to accept Edmund’s seductions. Goneril’s husband, Albany, is disgusted and disturbed by his sadistic in-laws.\nThe blinded Gloucester is thrown out to wander on the heath, where a horrified Edgar finds him. Gloucester, not recognizing his son’s voice, asks “Poor Tom” to lead him to a cliff’s edge so he can kill himself. Edgar pulls a trick on his father, taking him to a patch of flat ground. When he tries to jump, Gloucester only falls on his face. Edgar, still pretending to be a stranger, tells him that he miraculously survived his fall.\nMeanwhile, Kent leads Lear to safety with the French army and Cordelia. Half-mad and wandering around with flowers in his hair, Lear meets the broken Gloucester and consoles him. He also apologizes to Cordelia, having learned to understand his own terrible mistakes.\nOn Edmund’s orders, Goneril’s servant Oswald tries to kill Gloucester. Edgar protects his father, by killing Oswald. On Oswald’s body, Edgar finds a letter from Goneril to Edmund in which she encourages Edmund to murder Albany and marry her.\nAs Regan and Goneril are fight over him, Edmund strategizes about how to kill Lear, Cordelia, and Edgar so he can marry one of the sisters and become king himself. In a great success for Edmund, the English forces defeat the French and capture the reconciled Cordelia and Lear.\nAfter the victory, Regan and Goneril fight openly over Edmund, but before anyone wins, Regan dies; Goneril poisoned her. Albany, who learned from the disguised Edgar about Goneril and Edmund’s plot against him, confronts his murderous wife who commits suicide. Albany joins Cordelia’s army.\nEdgar reveals his identity to Gloucester who dies of the shock. The grieving Edgar then presents himself in disguise as a challenger to Edmund. The fate of the kingdom will rest on which brother wins in combat. After a tense swordfight, Edgar defeats Edmund and dramatically reveals his identity. Dying, Edmund tells his brother that he gave orders for Lear and Cordelia to be hanged. Edgar and Albany rush to stop the execution, but they are too late: Cordelia is dead. Lear appears, carrying her dead body and howling with grief. His heart broken, Lear dies. \nKent, Albany, and Edgar are the only men left standing. Kent excuses himself, intending to follow his master Lear wherever he goes, even into death. Edgar and Albany are left alone to rebuild the shattered kingdom. Edgar closes the play with a shellshocked speech, declaring that the survivors must face this horrific time with honesty.", "url": "https://www.supersummary.com/king-lear/", "author": "William Shakespeare", "characters": {"Lear": "Lear is a mighty figure and a titan among Shakespeare’s tragic heroes. But he’s also a small-minded, ill-tempered, and self-involved old man—at least at the start. Lear’s initial bad decision to ask his daughters how much they love him before he’ll give them his kingdom sets the scene for the whole play. This demand suggests a world where love is nothing but an expression of power. Lear is fortunate to be truly loved by Cordelia, Kent, and his Fool, who refuse to play along with his manipulative game.As his plan backfires, Lear rediscovers his connection to reality over the course of the play. When he goes mad in the midst of a terrible storm, his madness paradoxically reconnects him to reality: he remembers that he, like Edgar’s beggar “Poor Tom,” is a “poor, bare, forked animal” (3.4.108), a mortal being in a painful and unpredictable world. Over the rest of the play, he acts on what he’s learned, consoling the blinded Gloucester, humbling himself before the wronged Cordelia, and submitting to imprisonment with a wisdom that comes from a sense that there are things in this world more important than power and status.But this isn’t a morality play—at least, not in the conventional sense—and Lear receives no reward for his education in harsh reality. Instead, he is forced to endure his beloved daughter’s senseless death. In his lament over her body, Lear asks the profound, broken, human question about the mortality of those we love: “Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life/And thou no breath at all?” (5.3.313-14)", "Cordelia": "Alone among her sisters, Cordelia is a truth-teller. Like Edgar, she’s a victim of her family’s schemes, shortsightedness, and selfishness. Unlike Edgar, she’s a shrewd seer right from the start, well aware that Lear’s manipulations fly in the face of real love. Cordelia’s profound courage and goodness are at first visible only to a few other clear-eyed characters: Kent, the Fool, and the King of France, who marries her and later helps her mount an invasion to save her father. Cordelia is Lear’s favorite, but he only comes to understand his daughter’s true worth after he rejects her for refusing to play along with his games. Her brutal and preventable death speaks to the play’s unflinching engagement with the world’s injustices. When the 17th-century playwright Nahum Tate reworked King Lear to be a little more palatable for squeamish audiences, he was so appalled by this ending that he rescued Cordelia and married her off to Edgar.", "Goneril": "Goneril is the eldest of Lear’s daughters. Like her sister Regan, she is conniving and selfish. But she’s also pitiable. She seems to be the least favorite of Lear’s daughters. Less tricky than Regan and less beloved than Cordelia, she’s set up to fail from the start in Lear’s “who-loves-me-most?” contest. And when Lear turns on her in anger, his curse entreating the gods to make her infertile draws attention to the fact that this eldest daughter, married for some time, is still childless. Her unhappy marriage to Albany degenerates over the course of the play, and when Regan’s lust for Edmund imperils Goneril’s own claim on Edmund’s heart, Goneril turns to murder, poisoning her own sister.", "Regan": "Regan is the middle child of the Lear family and the cleverest schemer of the bunch. Her cunning play off Goneril’s initial love-speech—“I love you just like Goneril says, but even more!”—suggests that she’s learned manipulation and power-lust at her father’s knee. Regan becomes steadily more frightening over the course of the play. She takes sadistic pleasure in gouging out Gloucester’s eyes and instructing that he be thrown out to “smell/his way to Dover” (3.7.94-95). Her eventual death-match with Goneril over Edmund’s favor—a death-match she loses—suggests a poisonous dynamic running deep in Lear’s family: these two sisters have been trained to believe that love and power are commodities that must be won at any cost.", "Edgar": "The earnest, trusting Edgar grows up fast over the course of the play. Gloucester’s legitimate son, he is easily fooled by the machinations of his half-brother Edmund. When he flees into the night, he chooses the least comfortable disguise he can, becoming the naked lunatic “Poor Tom.” His time as Poor Tom is as transformative for him as it is for Lear. In enacting the role of a gibbering and impoverished beggar, he comes into contact with a deep reality about human life: we’re all a suit of clothes and a roof away from our helpless animal nature, and we rely on each other to keep the wolves awayEdgar also becomes an artist through his disguise, constructing a vivid imaginary “cliff of Dover” to save his father’s life. When Edgar concludes that humans must “speak what we feel, not what we ought to say,” he’s refers to the truths that art can reveal as well, as the honesty of a person like Cordelia or Kent.", "Edmund": "The illegitimate Edmund is a charismatic, eloquent, and ruthless villain—right up until the end of his life. Embittered by his father Gloucester’s scorn for him, Edmund becomes obsessed with climbing the social ladder. He spends most of the play turning families against each other to further his own ends. He sows division between his father and his brother, and he encourages Goneril and Regan to fight—and ultimately die—for his love. But when Edgar at last defeats him, some glimmer of humanity seeps out of Edmund. Remembering that “Edmund was beloved,” he tries to stop Cordelia and Lear’s executions—executions he ordered. Many of the play’s questions about fate and character center on this complex figure.", "Gloucester": "The Earl of Gloucester, like his friend and counterpart Lear, begins the play hot-tempered and small-minded. Openly scornful of his illegitimate son Edmund, he is a despotic parent, demanding perfunctorily that Edmund show him his private correspondence. Unfortunately for him, this demand plays right into Edmund’s plan to disinherit his innocent half-brother Edgar. Gloucester’s immediate willingness to believe that his loving son Edgar wishes to kill him suggests his fearful limitations. Like Lear, he is so self-involved he can’t recognize love or treachery where he finds them. Ironically, it’s only after Gloucester is violently blinded that he can see the truth. ", "Kent": "The heartbreakingly loyal Kent sticks by Lear no matter what, understanding that the king needs support most when he is at his worst. Like Edgar, Kent finds freedom in his disguise. As Caius, he is able to speak bluntly for the first time. He takes great pleasure in doing so, as in Act 2, Scene 2 when he gleefully and colorfully insults Goneril’s servant Oswald. A pragmatist, Kent focuses on getting Lear out of the storm at all costs. But when his master finally dies, he is unable to continue living. ", "The Fool": "Like Kent and Cordelia, the Fool is willing to speak truth to power. Unlike Kent and Cordelia, the Fool gets away with it, precisely because he is a fool. This is a recurring character archetype that emerges in some form in most of Shakespeare’s plays, including As You Like It and A Midsummer Night’s Dream. A licensed jester who is allowed to say things to the King that no one else could, the Fool is the first to get through to Lear. He has genuine affection for his “nuncle Lear,” the same kind of honest love that motivates Cordelia to tell Lear what he really doesn’t want to hear. Some productions even cast the same actor as Cordelia and the Fool; they’re never on stage together. The Fool follows Lear willingly into the terrible storm, after which he disappears without explanation, mysteriously absorbed into the play’s darkness."}, "chapter_summaries": {"Act I, Scene 1 Summary": "Two noblemen, Kent and Gloucester, discuss a mysterious political change: the King plans to relinquish his power and divide his kingdom. Gloucester introduces Kent to his illegitimate son Edmund, making a few rude jokes about Edmund’s birth.King Lear arrives and welcomes his family members: his eldest daughter Goneril and her husband Albany, his middle daughter Regan and her husband Cornwall, and his youngest unmarried daughter Cordelia. Lear announces he will “shake all cares and business from our age,/Conferring them on younger strengths while we/Unburdened crawl toward death” (39-41). He intends to divide his kingdom between his daughters and to marry Cordelia to one of two suitors, the King of France or the Duke of Burgundy.Before relinquishing his kingdom, Lear insists that his daughters tell him: “Which of you shall we say doth love us most,/That we our largest bounty may extend/Where nature doth with merit challenge” (51-53).The two eldest daughters take turns lavishly praising their father. Goneril goes first and shamelessly flatters him; Regan follows, saying that she loves her father as Goneril does, only even more. The youngest daughter, Cordelia, listens in horror to this insincere display. When it is her turn, Lear expects that his favorite daughter will praise him the most. But Cordelia refuses to speak. Instead, she critiques her sisters’ false flattery.Enraged by Cordelia’s refusal to play along, Lear banishes her, stripping her of her dowry. The shocked Kent tries to tell his master this is a terrible mistake, but Lear only turns his fury on his loyal councillor, banishing him as well.Without her dowry, Cordelia is left to whichever prince is willing to take her. Burgundy withdraws his suit, but the King of France sees Cordelia’s wisdom and goodness. She accepts his offer of marriage and departs for his kingdom. As the scene ends, the two elder sisters talk privately, remarking that their father is senile. They have little sympathy for their exiled younger sister.  ", "Act I, Scene 2 Summary": "Edmund, Gloucester’s illegitimate son, delivers a soliloquy on the injustices of his position in life. He swears allegiance to Nature rather than the customs of a society that denies him rank and power because his father wasn’t married to his mother: “Why bastard? Wherefore base,/When my dimensions are as well compact,/my mind as generous, and my shape as true,/As honest madam’s issue?” (6-9). Embittered by his ill-treatment, he plots to turn Gloucester against his legitimate brother Edgar and take over the dukedom himself.Gloucester appears in a flurry, shocked at recent events, including Kent’s banishment, hostilities between France and England, and Lear’s abdication of the throne. As he bustles in, Edmund makes an obvious show of hiding a letter, which Gloucester insists on seeing. It is a fake letter from Edgar, composed by Edmund. In it, Edgar supposedly asks Edmund to assassinate Gloucester with him. Appalled, Gloucester asks Edmund to investigate further. He reflects that the astrological signs bode ill; the stars predict war and discord within families and nations.When Gloucester leaves, Edmund scoffs at his father’s superstition, maintaining that the stars have no effect on human character: “I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing” (131-133). Edgar interrupts his musings. Edmund tricks him into believing that Gloucester is enraged with him. Although Edmund says he will try to calm their father down, he warns his brother to carry a weapon. Frightened and overwhelmed, Edgar departs. Edmund rejoices. His father’s credulity and his brother’s innocence both serve his purposes.", "Act I, Scene 3 Summary": "Goneril storms onstage in a huff, asking her servant Oswald if Lear hit one of her men for provoking his Fool. She is fed up with her father’s behavior. He and his entourage of drunken knights party day and night in Goneril’s house. She tells Oswald she plans to avoid Lear for a while and that he should tell her father she’s sick if he asks for her. She also counsels Oswald and the rest of her staff to be as rude and lazy as they like around Lear and his men.", "Act I, Scene 4 Summary": "The banished Kent disguises himself as a rough servant named Caius so he can watch over Lear; his loyalty to his master outweighs all other concerns. As Caius, he presents himself to Lear’s crew of knights and quickly earns Lear’s trust when he upbraids Oswald—who, as Goneril instructed him, is blatantly rude to the former king. The Fool, Lear’s much-beloved jester, is heartbroken since Lear sent Cordelia away. He now emerges to read his master a lesson in his mistakes. When he sings a mocking song, and Lear ominously asks, “Dost thou call me fool, boy?”, he replies, “All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast born with” (145-47).As the Fool mocks Lear and his daughters, the furious Goneril enters. She tells her father she will no longer tolerate his chaotic knights, and he must send at least some of them away. Lear flies into a rage and curses his eldest child, calling on Nature to “Dry up in her the organs of increase” so that she’ll never have a child of her own (275). With that, he departs, intending to go to Regan’s house where he believes he can do what he wants. Goneril sends Oswald ahead to warn Regan and to tell her to hold firm with their father. Her husband Albany warns her that this may be a mistake.", "Act I, Scene 5 Summary": "Lear sends the disguised Kent to deliver a letter to Regan’s castle explaining what happened at Goneril’s house. Left alone with the Fool, Lear broods. The Fool gently teases him and tries to warn him that Regan isn’t likely to behave any differently than Goneril.Lear is shaken by his recent fits of uncontrollable rage. He fears for his sanity, saying, “O let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!/Keep me in temper; I would not be mad!” (43-44).", "Act II, Scene 1 Summary": "Edmund hears rumors about a war brewing between Albany and Cornwall, who both may have designs on the undivided throne. Regan and Cornwall will visit the Gloucester household that night, giving Edmund more opportunity to scheme. He continues his plot against his own family, telling Edgar: “My father watches. O sir, fly this place” (20). The enraged Gloucester, Edmund claims, is on Edgar’s trail, and Edmund will need to pretend to attack his brother in order to keep him safe. Edmund draws his sword, and the bewildered, frightened Edgar flees into the night. Edmund wounds himself to give the impression that Edgar injured him. When Gloucester appears, Edmund spins a tale in which Edgar mutters of patricide and chants magical charms. Crazed with rage and grief, Gloucester threatens to have his legitimate son killed and vows to grant Edmund his title and lands, just as Edmund plotted.Cornwall and Regan arrive and commiserate with Gloucester. They also swear friendship with Edmund, whom they see as a potentially useful man.", "Act II, Scene 2 Summary": "Goneril’s steward Oswald meets Kent outside Gloucester’s house. Kent, remembering Oswald’s rudeness to Lear, is accordingly rude to Oswald, going on an exuberant tirade against him: Oswald, Kent says, is: [a] knave, a rascal, an eater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered, action-taking, whoreson, glass-gazing, superservicable, finical rogue (13-17). At last, Kent draws his sword, and Oswald screams for help.Edmund, Gloucester, Regan, and Cornwall overhear the ruckus and confront the two men. Kent won’t budge, and Cornwall commands him to be put in the stocks for his insolence. Regan adds that, in spite of his old age, Kent must sit in the stocks all day and all night. With Kent imprisoned, everyone but Gloucester departs. Gloucester empathizes with Kent and says he will try to change Cornwall’s mind. Whatever happens, he and Kent both know that Lear won’t take this well; it is a serious insult for Cornwall to put Lear’s servant in the stocks.", "Act II, Scene 3 Summary": "Edgar, on the run, pauses to deliver a soliloquy. Confused and terrified, he considers his options, all of which are bad. Nowhere is safe, and no friendly face can be trusted. His best option is to disguise himself as someone no one looks at twice. He decides to dress up as a vagrant madman called Poor Tom, vowing, “[M]y face I’ll grime with filth,/Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots,/And with presented nakedness outface/The winds and persecutions of the sky” (9-12). He will chant nonsense, beg for alms, and entirely unmake himself: “Edgar I nothing am” (21), he says.", "Act II, Scene 4 Summary": "Lear and the Fool arrive at Gloucester’s house and find Kent in the stocks outside. Lear is outraged and unbelieving, shocked that Cornwall would dare to disrespect his servant this way. Kent also tells Lear that Oswald delivered letters from Goneril ahead of his arrival. The Fool isn’t surprised; this is exactly what he predicted, and he sings cryptic little songs to that effect.Lear rushes off and returns with Gloucester who tries to calm him down. Cornwall delayed his meeting with Lear, refusing to jump at the former king’s command. When Cornwall and Regan eventually arrive, Lear is furious with them, and they coolly condescend to him. When Goneril appears, the two sisters present a united face against their father, asking him why he needs even one servant, let alone his retinue of rowdy knights. As before, Lear flies into a rage, calling Regan “a boil,/A plague-sore, or embossèd carbuncle,/In my corrupted blood” (222-224).As madness descends upon him, Lear flees from the house, pursued by the Fool and Kent. In spite of Gloucester’s appalled protests, his family lets him go. There is a violent storm brewing, and the family is reluctant to follow Lear into it.", "Acts I-II Analysis": "The first acts of King Lear gather like the storm that breaks at the end of Act II. The play begins with a queasy lightning flash: Lear’s manipulative question to his daughters. Right away, readers are exposed to a world in which love is corrupted into a tool for maintaining power. In relinquishing his kingdom to his children, Lear attempts to exert a deeper power through emotional backchannels, demanding that his daughters bow to his demands for a very specific kind of affection and attention. As Cordelia points out, these demands border on emotional incest. Something is thoroughly out of order in Lear’s kingdom, and the balance of nature is about to set it right, through means that no mere human is going to like very much.The daughters’ different responses to Lear’s manipulation set up one of the play’s big themes: reality and self-delusion. Cordelia’s refusal to play her father’s game infuriates him because he doesn’t get to bask in obsequious praise. More than that, however, the refusal is a critique of Lear’s emotional dishonesty, revealing that his self-image can’t stand up to resistance or disagreement. He depends on the belief that he’s the finest father and the best king in all the world, and any threat to that belief shakes his whole worldview. As Regan points out, “[H]e hath ever but slenderly known himself” (1.1.298-99). Lear, like all the play’s characters, will reckon with what he really is over the course of the play.Questions of truth and deception touch on every character’s predicament. The parallel stories of Edmund and Edgar provide a piquant example. Edmund, Gloucester’s illegitimate son, uses deception to rise to a noble position that feels truer to his self-image, but this new reality is based entirely on treacherous falsehoods. Meanwhile, Edgar, the legitimate son, finds truth through his seemingly false disguise as the mad “Poor Tom.” The play repeatedly insists that public status and honor are essentially worthless. Contact with reality and with one’s true self involves complete humility, even abasement. In turn, pride and power sever the play’s characters from reality and the perceptions of others.These early acts also set up two contrasting views of man and nature, one of which is exemplified by Lear and Gloucester, while the other is exemplified by Edmund. Lear and his ilk profess faith in the old Medieval traditions of noble birth and kingly patriarchy. When this worldview is shattered by his daughters’ lack of deference, Lear devolves into madness. Edmund, meanwhile, represents the “New Man” emerging in Shakespeare’s time. This figure rejects Lear’s Medieval worldview and instead adopts a Hobbesian view of the world in which all men war against one another for an advantage. This is reflected in Edmund’s self-interested schemes which recall Machiavelli’s 1513 book The Prince. Though written almost one hundred years earlier, The Prince remained highly influential in Shakespeare’s era.  ", "Act III, Scene 1 Summary": "Out on the heath in a raging storm, Kent meets a gentleman who tells him he’s seen Lear, running wild and shouting into the wind and rain. The conditions are so wild that even “the cub-drawn bear would couch,/The lion and the belly-pinchèd wolf/Keep their fur dry” (12-14). Yet the elderly and maddened Lear is exposed to the elements. Kent warns this gentleman that Albany and Cornwall are secretly plotting against each other and that the King of France—Cordelia’s new husband—plans to invade and take the country back from these treacherous dukes. If the gentleman goes to Dover, he can deliver news of Lear’s plight and give Cordelia Kent’s ring as a token. The gentleman agrees, and Kent rushes off to search for Lear.", "Act III, Scene 2 Summary": "Lear, followed by the loyal Fool, spits fury at the weather: Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage, blow!/You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout/Till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the cocks./You sulph’rous and thought-executing fires,/Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts,/Singe my white head (1-6). The Fool struggles to get his master to shelter. Lear continues to rage at the sky, and the sky rages back.Kent joins the Fool in an attempt to get Lear into the shelter of a nearby hovel. Lear comes back to himself for a moment, understanding that he’s losing his mind. He also returns to the people around him, asking the Fool: “How dost, my boy? Art cold?/I am cold myself” (69-70). He agrees to go to the hovel. The shaken Fool ends the scene with a cryptic prophecy of confusion and danger in England.", "Act III, Scene 3 Summary": "Gloucester confides in Edmund: he is appalled by the way Lear’s daughters treat their father. When he objected, he reports, Cornwall and Regan turned him out of his own house and forbade him from communicating with Lear. He goes on, explaining the two dukes’ secret enmity and telling Edmund he received a confidential letter about the approaching French invasion. He plans to rescue Lear, regardless of Cornwall and Regan’s prohibitions.All of these confidences play right into Edmund’s hands. After his father departs, he vows, “This courtesy forbid thee shall the duke/Instantly know, and of that letter too,” and relishes his imminent victory: “The younger rises when the old doth fall” (20-24).", "Act III, Scene 4 Summary": "Kent leads Lear and the Fool to the hovel. Still bewailing his daughters’ betrayal, Lear hurries his friends in first. In a moment of lucidity, he pauses to think of all the “poor naked wretches” (30) enduring this storm with him even now. Just then, a scream comes from within the hovel, and the Fool rushes out, claiming there’s a lunatic inside. This is “lunatic” is Edgar, deep in disguise as the beggar Poor Tom. Edgar raves, speaking of “the foul fiend” and singing snatches of bawdy ballads. Lear takes to this madman immediately and personally, believing that only treacherous daughters like his own could have made this man so mad. He deliriously interrogates Edgar and strips off his own clothing in imitation of this naked beggar. The beleaguered Fool tries to forestall him: “Prithee, nuncle, be contented; ‘tis a naughty night to swim in” (110-11). Gloucester arrives. Without recognizing his own son, he hurries the group toward a safe house. Edgar must listen and keep his disguise up as Gloucester describes his son’s supposed betrayal, lamenting, “I loved him, friend,/No father his son dearer” (167-68).", "Act III, Scene 5 Summary": "Edmund delivers his father’s intelligence about the French invasion directly to Cornwall, who hurries to inform Regan. Cornwall also tells Edmund that his betrayal of his father has made him the Earl of Gloucester. Edmund will take his father’s title, and Cornwall will treat him as his own son. ", "Act III, Scene 6 Summary": "Kent and Gloucester bring Lear to a safe house. Edgar keeps up his mad ranting, speaking of damnation. Lear, spurred on, hallucinates an imaginary courtroom in which he puts his daughters on trial while the Fool and Edgar play along with his delusions. Edgar is so moved to intense pity by Lear’s madness that his tears threaten his disguise.At last, Lear falls into a troubled sleep. Gloucester and Kent return to collect him in a litter vehicle and carry him to Dover, where Cordelia’s army will offer him sanctuary. Everyone departs but Edgar, who remains to reflect on his experience with the king: “How light and portable my pain seems now,/When that which makes me bend makes the king bow” (107-108).", "Act III, Scene 7 Summary": "Goneril, Regan, Albany, Cornwall, and Edmund meet to plot revenge on Gloucester, whom they’ve captured for supporting Cordelia and rescuing Lear. Goneril and Edmund depart to prepare for war, leaving Regan and Cornwall to deal with Gloucester.The bloodthirsty couple tie Gloucester up and interrogate him, ignoring his cries for decency and mercy. When he doesn’t give them the answers they want, Cornwall puts out one of his eyes. Regan won’t be satisfied until he puts out the other. But as Cornwall moves to do just this, one of his horrified servants, horrified tries to fight him off. After a bloody struggle, Cornwall kills him and completes the job, blinding Gloucester as he recites these terrible words: “Out, vile jelly./Where is thy luster now?” (84-85). When Gloucester howls for Edmund, Cornwall and Regan reveal that Edmund betrayed him. They throw him out into the storm again to “smell/his way to Dover” (94-95). Cornwall realizes his servant mortally wounded him.The scene ends as two traumatized servants make plans to help the unfortunate Gloucester, bandaging his bleeding eye sockets and finding him a guide.", "Act III Analysis": "Act III contains one of the most famous scenes in all of world literature: Lear’s mad caper in the storm. An image of man as a tiny, angry, frightened speck amid wild nature, the storm scene is at once harrowing and blackly comical. Through this confrontation between despair and absurdity, the play’s most vivid picture of the human condition emerges.As Lear leaps around naked and Edgar rants and raves, a strange coherence emerges from their lunacy. While Edgar’s madness is feigned and Lear’s is true, both men come to a deeper understanding of their own natures—and human nature—through their seeming disconnect from reality. For Edgar, the externalizing of his internal predicament as a loveless exile driven to despair by treachery provides a strange relief; his mad-speak is as inventive and exuberant as it is horrific. For Lear, the sight of Edgar’s naked misery brings him to the realization that every man, himself included, is nothing but a “poor, bare, forked animal” (3.4.108). It’s through this realization that Lear finds his way to empathy for the first time—an empathy that demands he relinquish his puffed-up self image as mighty king. Later, this behavior will be referred to as “reason in madness.” This runs counter to Edmund and Cornwall’s “madness in reason,” a self-interested rationality that results in so much blood and death. These scenes also mark the beginning of Edgar’s role as an artist. Just as Edgar externalizes his misery in a kind of performance art, he provides a model and a mirror for Lear. Lear sees himself in Edgar, even accusing Edgar’s nonexistent daughters of having brought him to this pass, and finds a curious relief in that seeing. While the play offers no pat answers to questions of human suffering and human evil, it suggests that one way to grapple with these concepts is by creating artistic reflections of them—the better to see them, feel them, and even play with them. The poet John Keats would later remark on this quality in King Lear, writing that its truthfulness makes it beautiful even though it depicts horrors.But art isn’t a total solution to the mysteries of evil and pain, and Gloucester’s gruesome blinding makes that very clear. This scene is at once symbolic—Gloucester, who has proven so bad at seeing what’s true, can only see what’s real after he loses his literal eyes—and nastily concrete. The sadistic Cornwall’s cry, “Out, vile jelly./Where is thy luster now?” (3.7.84-85), returns us once more to the irreducible facts of the human body: its vulnerability and its mortality. ", "Act IV, Scene 1 Summary": "Having resigned himself to his terrible circumstances, Edgar believes he’s hit such an absolute low that there’s nowhere to go but up. At that moment, he sees the blinded Gloucester led by an old man and concludes, “The worst is not/So long as we can say, ‘This is the worst’” (27-28). Edgar presents himself as a guide to the miserable Gloucester, who wants to be led to the cliffs of Dover, where he can throw himself to his death. The old man leading Gloucester protests that Edgar is a madman; Gloucester, unperturbed, replies, “‘Tis the time’s plague when madmen lead the blind” (48). Although Edgar can barely keep up his act, he agrees to guide his father to the cliffs.", "Act IV, Scene 2 Summary": "Goneril, Oswald, and Edmund discuss changes they’ve observed in Albany, who now seems to have qualms about his family’s behavior, particularly Goneril’s. Goneril is neither surprised nor upset. She wants to marry Edmund now, and Albany can die for all she cares. Goneril and Edmund part with a kiss, and she sighs, “O, the difference of man and man:/To thee a woman’s services are due;/My fool usurps my body” (26-28). Albany enters and roundly curses his wife, accusing her of vicious cruelty to her father whom he remembers as a good and righteous king. Goneril retorts that she doesn’t expect Albany to step up and repel the French invaders.In the midst of their fight, a messenger brings news that Cornwall, stabbed by his servant during Gloucester’s blinding, is dead. Aghast to hear of the blinding, Albany wonders why Edmund didn’t stand in Cornwall’s way. Privately, he asks the messenger for more of the story.", "Act IV, Scene 3 Summary": "Kent meets with a gentleman who brings news of the invasion. The King of France rushed home to deal with a domestic problem, leaving behind a general to take charge of the war. Cordelia, who remains in England, was horrified to hear of her father’s suffering. Kent remarks that human personalities must be determined by the stars; how else could such a kind woman have two villainous sisters.Kent tells the gentleman that, though Lear is safe, he will resist seeing his loyal daughter. Lear’s terrible choices, Kent adds, “sting/His mind so venomously that burning shame/Detains him from Cordelia” (46-48). Kent, meanwhile, must take care of some secret business. He leaves Lear in the gentleman’s care.", "Act IV, Scene 4 Summary": "Cordelia consults with a doctor about her father. She laments that Lear was discovered, completely mad, singing to himself and wearing a crown of flowers and weeds. She wonders desperately if anything can cure him; the doctor advises her that what he needs is sleep. Cordelia sends men to find her father so she can keep him under her protection.A messenger arrives to tell Cordelia that the British forces are marching toward them. Cordelia prepares for war, motivated by love rather than power. She says, “No blown ambition doth our arms incite,/But love, dear love, and our aged father’s right” (27-28).", "Act IV, Scene 5 Summary": "Regan and Oswald discuss imminent war plans. Regan is less interested in the details of the fight than in Goneril’s communications with Edmund. Like her elder sister, Regan wants to marry him and feels her claim is better. She tells Oswald, “My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talked,/And more convenient is he for my hand/Than for your lady’s” (33-35). ", "Act IV, Scene 6 Summary": "Edgar claims to have led Gloucester to the cliffs of Dover. In reality, they are on a flat patch of ground. Edgar falsely describes the dizzying view from the heights above the sea: “The murmuring surge/That on th’ unnumb’red idle pebble chafes/Cannot be heard so high. I’ll look no more, Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight/Topple down headlong” (20-24). At first, Gloucester is suspicious, noting that the ground feels pretty flat and that his guide’s voice has changed. Ultimately, he accepts Edgar’s fiction and prepares himself for death. But when he tries to throw himself over the imaginary cliff, Gloucester merely falls on his face. Using a new voice, Edgar tells him that he survived a fall from a terrible height, characterizing the event as a miracle. He adds that Gloucester’s guide was a thousand-nosed demon and that Gloucester was saved by some divine intervention. Shaken, Gloucester resolves to endure his pain until he dies naturally. The mad Lear arrives wearing his flower crown. He speaks nonsense, seeing imaginary animals and phantom daughters while singing songs about lechery, corruption, and the stench of mortality. Like the Fool and Edgar before him, Lear’s madness demonstrates more understanding of the world than his sanity did. Gloucester recognizes his king by the sound of his voice, but Lear does not recognize Gloucester. In his insanity, Lear mocks him, telling him to read nonexistent papers that Gloucester couldn’t see even if they existed and admonishing him, “What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes with no eyes” (150-151). Finally, Lear recognizes Gloucester and sits down to console him as he weeps. “Thou must be patient,” he tells him: “We came crying hither;/Thou know’st, the first time that we smell the air/We wawl and cry” (178-80).Cordelia’s gentlemen arrive to take Lear to safety. He impishly runs away from them. Edgar collects news of the impending battle from one of these gentlemen and then reintroduces himself to Gloucester as a sane man offering to guide him.Oswald interrupts them and intends to murder Gloucester. Edgar fights and slays him. With his dying breath, Oswald tells Edgar to carry a letter to Edmund. It is a love letter from Goneril in which she begs Edmund to kill Albany and marry her. Edgar vows to stand in Edmund’s way. But first, he must take his father to a safe place.", "Act IV, Scene 7 Summary": "Cordelia and Kent reunite. She thanks him profusely for taking care of her father. The doctor tells Cordelia that Lear is now safely asleep, bathed, and dressed. Upon seeing him, Cordelia is deeply moved by the sight of her frail old father asleep after his ordeal, remarking, “Was this a face/To be opposed against the jarring winds?” (32-33). Still apparently mad, Lear wakes up and chides Cordelia for waking him from death. Yet he quickly comes back to himself, newly humbled and self-aware. He tells her, “Pray, do not mock me./I am a very foolish fond old man […] And, to deal plainly, I fear I am not in my perfect mind […] Do not laugh at me;/For, as I am a man, I think this lady/To be my child Cordelia” (61-72). Cordelia weeps as father and daughter reconcile.Kent and a gentleman discuss the imminent war and the bloody battle to come.", "Act V, Scene 1 Summary": "At the head of a crowd of soldiers, Edmund and Regan discuss Albany’s wavering and Oswald’s disappearance. Regan quizzes Edmund on whether he slept with Goneril, which he denies.Goneril and Albany interrupt this conversation. Albany tells them that Lear is with Cordelia. Goneril suggests that they all unite against France since France is their common enemy. As Goneril and Regan jockey to prevent each other from being with Edmund alone, the three exit together.Edgar appears to Albany in disguise, gives him a letter, and tells him that if the English forces are victorious over the French, Albany should sound a trumpet to summon a champion who will help him. Edmund reappears and tells Albany it is time to fight. Left alone, Edmund addresses the audience. Having sworn love to both Goneril and Regan, he muses over whether to sleep with “[b]oth? One? Or neither? Neither can be enjoyed,/If both remain alive” (59-60). He also vows that if his forces win the battle, both Cordelia and Lear will receive no mercy.", "Act V, Scene 2 Summary": "Edgar leads Gloucester away from the battle, concealing him in the shadow of a tree. Shortly thereafter, he returns and tells Gloucester that all is lost. With Cordelia’s forces defeated, Gloucester must flee. Gloucester resists, wanting only to die, but Edgar chides him: “What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure/Their going hence, even as their coming hither;/Ripeness is all” (9-11). Gloucester follows him.", "Act V, Scene 3 Summary": "The triumphant Edmund enters with his captives, Lear and Cordelia, and instructs guards to take them to prison. Cordelia laments their fate, saying she could tolerate her own fall but not her father’s. Lear gently calms her: “Come, let’s away to prison./We two alone will sing like birds i’ th’ cage” (8-9). Edmund sends an ominous soldier after them with bloody instructions.Albany demands that Edmund surrender the captives so that Albany may treat them fairly. Edmund weasels his way around this request, and Albany warns him he shouldn’t take liberties: he’s a subject, not a brother. Regan rebukes Albany, warning him that when she marries Edmund, the two men will be brothers. Goneril pushes back, and the two women squabble over Edmund in Albany’s face.Based on the letter Edgar gave him, Albany arrests Edmund on charges of treason. He sounds the trumpet to summon the mysterious champion Edgar promised. Regan, overcome with a sudden sickness, is carried away. In private, Goneril gloats that she poisoned her sister. The champion appears: It is Edgar himself in another disguise. He accuses Edmund of treachery and conspiracy and challenges him to a final duel. The brothers battle, and Edgar mortally wounds Edmund.Albany produces Goneril’s letter to Edmund, confirming the charges against him and implicating her. Desperate, Goneril runs away. The dying Edmund readily admits to all of the charges laid at his feet and asks who it is that killed him. Edgar reveals himself at last, and Edmund marvels, “The wheel is come full circle” (176).Edgar explains to Albany that Gloucester is dead. When Edgar revealed his identity, Gloucester’s “flawed heart—/Alack, too weak the conflict to support—/‘Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,/Burst smilingly” (199-202). Moved by this story, Edmund asks Edgar to go on; Edgar duly recounts his reunion with the disguised Kent, during which the two men shared their stories of exile. A gentleman rushes in screaming that Goneril poisoned Regan and killed herself. Kent arrives asking after Lear, and Albany demands that Edmund tell them where the king and his daughter are. Edmund, slowly dying, reflects on the deaths of the two women who loved him and makes a new resolve: “Some good I mean to do,/Despite of mine own nature” (248-49). Before he is carried away to die offstage, he tells Albany to rush to the castle to halt Lear and Cordelia’s execution.But it is too late. Lear appears carrying Cordelia’s hanged body and crying “Howl, howl, howl!” (263). The stunned onlookers watch as Lear wails over his daughter’s corpse: “Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,/And thou no breath at all? Thou’lt come no more,/Never, never, never, never, never” (313-15). In despair, Lear too dies. Shocked and grieving, Albany turns to Kent and Edgar, begging them to rule the kingdom. Kent refuses, saying he has other work to do: “I have a journey, sir, shortly to go./My master calls me; I must not say no” (328-29).Edgar and Albany are left alone to try to heal the broken state. Edgar closes the play with these solemn words: “The weight of this sad time we must obey,/Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say./The oldest hath borne most; we that are young/Shall never see so much, nor live so long” (330-33).", "Acts IV-V Analysis": "The agony of the last acts of King Lear is all the powerful because Shakespeare sets readers up for a happier ending than he delivers. Shortly before the tragic conclusion, many characters come to terms with their ordeals and find ways to endure. Edgar uses the power of language to persuade Gloucester that, even blind and miserable, his life is a miracle. Lear finds an impish kindness in the depths of his madness, begs Cordelia’s forgiveness, and faces imprisonment with humble courage. Edmund has a deathbed change of heart and renounces his villainies, remembering that he was once beloved. But all these glimmers of hope meet with a universe full of incomprehensible cruelty.The end of the play is famously brutal. Lear howls over Cordelia’s corpse, speaking words that will resonate with anyone who has ever grieved: “Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,/And thou no breath at all? Thou’lt come no more,/Never, never, never, never, never” (5.3.313-15). Here, Lear confronts the horrors of human evil and the final incomprehensibility of mortality. His chilling refrain of “Never” suggests a man trying to make himself understand a word in a foreign language. Cordelia’s death is unnatural but also inevitable; as Macbeth remarks of his dead wife in his eponymous play, “She should have died hereafter.” Death comes to all, and that is the final inscrutable darkness everyone must confront.The senselessness of Cordelia’s death was deeply disturbing to audiences throughout the play’s life. One watcher, the 17th-century playwright Nahum Tate, was so appalled by this ending that he rewrote the play to rescue Cordelia and marry her off to Edgar. But Shakespeare’s King Lear offers no such consolations. How humans live in the face of arbitrary, senseless death is the play’s great question.King Lear offers only a ghost of an answer, a spark in the darkness. By the end of the play, nearly everyone is dead or about to be dead—the loyal Kent implies that he’ll follow Lear into death. Only Albany and Edgar remain. Edgar, who transformed his pain into art over the course of the play, gets the final words, a commentary on words themselves. In order to “obey” the gravity of this hideous moment, Edgar says they must “[s]peak what we feel, not what we ought to say” (5.3.331). To speak the truth is to admit what we do not know and to refuse to escape into fantasy and self-delusion as so many characters do during the play. Only by meeting pain head-on can humans live complete and honest lives."}}, "num_tokens": 95900}
