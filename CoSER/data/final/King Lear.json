I\n\nhave so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am\n\nbrazed to it.\n\nKent I cannot conceive you.\n\nGloucester Sir, this young fellow’s mother could;\n\nwhereupon she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir,\n\na son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed. Do\n\nyou smell a fault?\n\nKent I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so\n\nproper.\n\nGloucester But I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year\n\nelder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though\n\nthis knave came something saucily to the world before he\n\nwas sent for, yet was his mother fair; there was good sport\n\nat his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledged.\n\nDo you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?\n\nEdmund No, my lord.\n\nGloucester My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter\n\nas my honourable friend.\n\nEdmund My services to your lordship.\n\nKent I must love you, and sue to know you better.\n\nEdmund Sir, I shall study deserving.\n\nGloucester He hath been out nine years, and away he shall\n\nagain. The King is coming.\n\n[ Sennet. Enter  King Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril,\n\nRegan, Cordelia,  and Attendants ]\n\nLear Attend the Lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.\n\nGloucester I shall, my Liege.\n\n[ Exeunt  Gloucester  and  Edmund]\n\nLear Meantime, we shall express our darker purpose.\n\nGive me the map there. Know that we have divided\n\nIn three our kingdom; and ’tis our fast intent\n\nTo shake all cares and business from our age,\n\nConferring them on younger strengths, while we\n\nUnburdened crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,\n\nAnd you, our no less loving son of Albany,\n\nWe have this hour a constant will to publish\n\nOur daughters’ several dowers, that future strife\n\nMay be prevented now. The princes, France and\n\nBurgundy,\n\nGreat rivals in our youngest daughter’s love,\n\nLong in our court have made their amorous sojourn,\n\nAnd here are to be answered. Tell me, my daughters –\n\nSince now we will divest us both of rule,\n\nInterest of territory, cares of state –\n\nWhich of you shall we say doth love us most?\n\nThat we our largest bounty may extend\n\nWhere nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,\n\nOur eldest-born, speak first.\n\nGoneril Sir, I love you more than words can wield the\n\nmatter;\n\nDearer than eye-sight, space and liberty;\n\nBeyond what can be valued rich or rare;\n\nNo less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;\n\nAs much as child e’er loved, or father found;\n\nA love that makes breath poor and speech unable;\n\nBeyond all manner of so much I love you.\n\nCordelia [ aside ] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be\n\nsilent.\n\nLear Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,\n\nWith shadowy forests and with champains riched,\n\nWith plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,\n\nWe make thee lady; to thine and Albany’s issues\n\nBe this perpetual. What says our second daughter,\n\nOur dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak.\n\nRegan I am made of that self metal as my sister,\n\nAnd prize me at her worth. In my true heart\n\nI find she names my very deed of love:\n\nOnly she comes too short: that I profess\n\nMyself an enemy to all other joys\n\nWhich the most precious square of sense possesses,\n\nAnd find I am alone felicitate\n\nIn your dear Highness’ love.\n\nCordelia [ aside ] Then poor Cordelia!\n\nAnd yet not so; since I am sure my love’s\n\nMore ponderous than my tongue.\n\nLear To thee and thine, hereditary ever,\n\nRemain this ample third of our fair kingdom,\n\nNo less in space, validity, and pleasure,\n\nThan that conferred on Goneril. Now, our joy,\n\nAlthough our last, not least; to whose young love\n\nThe vines of France and milk of Burgundy\n\nStrive to be interessed; what can you say to draw\n\nA third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.\n\nCordelia Nothing, my lord.\n\nLear Nothing?\n\nCordelia Nothing.\n\nLear Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.\n\nCordelia Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave\n\nMy heart into my mouth: I love your Majesty\n\nAccording to my bond; no more nor less.\n\nLear How, how, Cordelia! Mend your speech a little,\n\nLest it may mar your fortunes.\n\nCordelia Good my lord,\n\nYou have begot me, bred me, loved me: I\n\nReturn those duties back as are right fit,\n\nObey you, love you, and most honour you.\n\nWhy have my sisters husbands, if they say\n\nThey love you all? Happily, when I shall wed,\n\nThat lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry\n\nHalf my love with him, half my care and duty:\n\nSure I shall never marry like my sisters,\n\nTo love my father all.\n\nLear But goes thy heart with this?\n\nCordelia Ay, my good lord.\n\nLear So young, and so untender?\n\nCordelia So young, my lord, and true.\n\nLear Let it be so; thy truth then be thy dower:\n\nFor, by the sacred radiance of the sun,\n\nThe mysteries of Hecate and the night,\n\nBy all the operation of the orbs\n\nFrom whom we do exist and cease to be,\n\nHere I disclaim all my paternal care,\n\nPropinquity and property of blood,\n\nAnd as a stranger to my heart and me\n\nHold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,\n\nOr he that makes his generation messes\n\nTo gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom\n\nBe as well neighboured, pitied, and relieved,\n\nAs thou my sometime daughter.\n\nKent Good my liege –\n\nLear Peace, Kent!\n\nCome not between the dragon and his wrath.\n\nI loved her most, and thought to set my rest\n\nOn her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!\n\nSo be my grave my peace, as here I give\n\nHer father’s heart from her! Call France. Who stirs?\n\nCall Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,\n\nWith my two daughters’ dowers digest this third;\n\nLet pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.\n\nI do invest you jointly with my power,\n\nPre-eminence, and all the large effects\n\nThat troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,\n\nWith reservation of an hundred knights\n\nBy you to be sustained, shall our abode\n\nMake with you by due turn. Only we shall retain\n\nThe name and all th’ addition to a king;\n\nThe sway, revenue, execution of the rest,\n\nBeloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,\n\nThis coronet part between you.\n\nKent Royal Lear,\n\nWhom I have ever honoured as my King,\n\nLoved as my father, as my master followed,\n\nAs my great patron thought on in my prayers, –\n\nLear The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.\n\nKent Let it fall rather, though the fork invade\n\nThe region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,\n\nWhen Lear is mad. What would’st thou do, old man?\n\nThink’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak\n\nWhen power to flattery bows? To plainness honour’s bound\n\nWhen majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state;\n\nAnd, in thy best consideration, check\n\nThis hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,\n\nThy youngest daughter does not love thee least;\n\nNor are those empty-hearted whose low sounds\n\nReverb no hollowness.\n\nLear Kent, on thy life, no more.\n\nKent My life I never held but as a pawn\n\nTo wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,\n\nThy safety being the motive.\n\nLear Out of my sight!\n\nKent See better, Lear; and let me still remain\n\nThe true blank of thine eye.\n\nLear Now, by Apollo –\n\nKent Now, by Apollo, King,\n\nThou swear’st thy gods in vain.\n\nLear O vassal! Miscreant!\n\n[ Laying his hand on his sword ]\n\nAlb., Corn. Dear sir, forbear.\n\nKent Do: kill thy physician, and the fee bestow\n\nUpon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift;\n\nOr, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,\n\nI’ll tell thee thou dost evil.\n\nLear Hear me, recreant!\n\nOn thine allegiance, hear me!\n\nSince thou hast sought to make us break our vow,\n\nWhich we durst never yet, and with strained pride\n\nTo come betwixt our sentence and our power,\n\nWhich nor our nature nor our place can bear,\n\nOur potency made good, take thy reward.\n\nFive days we do allot thee for provision\n\nTo shield thee from disasters of the world;\n\nAnd on the sixth to turn thy hated back\n\nUpon our kingdom: if on the tenth day following\n\nThy banished trunk be found in our dominions,\n\nThe moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,\n\nThis shall not be revoked.\n\nKent Fare thee well, King; sith thus thou wilt appear,\n\nFreedom lives hence, and banishment is here.\n\n[ To  Cordelia ] The gods to their dear shelter take thee,\n\nmaid,\n\nThat justly think’st and has most rightly said!\n\n[ To  Goneril  and  Regan ] And your large speeches may your\n\ndeeds approve,\n\nThat good effects may spring from words of love.\n\nThus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;\n\nHe’ll shape his old course in a country new.\n\n[ Exit ]\n\n[ Flourish. Re-enter  Gloucester,  with  France, Burgundy,\n\nand Attendants ]\n\nGloucester Here’s France and Burgundy, my noble lord.\n\nLear My Lord of Burgundy,\n\nWe first address toward you, who with this king\n\nHath rivalled for our daughter. What, in the least,\n\nWill you require in present dower with her,\n\nOr cease your quest of love?\n\nBurgundy Most royal Majesty,\n\nI crave no more than hath your Highness offered,\n\nNor will you tender less.\n\nLear Right noble Burgundy,\n\nWhen she was dear to us, we did hold her so,\n\nBut now her price is fallen. Sir, there she stands:\n\nIf aught within that little-seeming substance,\n\nOr all of it, with our displeasure pieced,\n\nAnd nothing more, may fitly like your grace,\n\nShe’s there, and she is yours.\n\nBurgundy I know no answer.\n\nLear Will you, with those infirmities she owes,\n\nUnfriended, new-adopted to our hate,\n\nDowered with our curse and strangered with our oath,\n\nTake her, or leave her?\n\nBurgundy Pardon me, royal Sir;\n\nElection makes not up in such conditions.\n\nLear Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,\n\nI tell you all her wealth. [ To  France ] For you, great King,\n\nI would not from your love make such a stray\n\nTo match you where I hate; therefore beseech you\n\nT’avert your liking a more worthier way\n\nThan on a wretch whom Nature is ashamed\n\nAlmost to acknowledge hers.\n\nFrance This is most strange,\n\nThat she, whom even but now was your best object,\n\nThe argument of your praise, balm of your age,\n\nThe best, the dearest, should in this trice of time\n\nCommit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle\n\nSo many folds of favour. Sure, her offence\n\nMust be of such unnatural degree\n\nThat monsters it, or your fore-vouched affection\n\nFall into taint; which to believe of her,\n\nMust be a faith that reason without miracle\n\nShould never plant in me.\n\nCordelia I yet beseech your Majesty –\n\nIf for I want that glib and oily art\n\nTo speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,\n\nI’ll do’t before I speak – that you make known\n\nIt is no vicious blot, murder or foulness,\n\nNo unchaste action, or dishonoured step,\n\nThat hath deprived me of your grace and favour,\n\nBut even for want of that for which I am richer,\n\nA still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue\n\nThat I am glad I have not, though not to have it\n\nHath lost me in your liking.\n\nLear Better thou\n\nHadst not been born than not t’have pleased me better.\n\nFrance Is it but this? A tardiness in nature\n\nWhich often leaves the history unspoke\n\nThat it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy,\n\nWhat say you to the lady? Love’s not love\n\nWhen it is mingled with regards that stand\n\nAloof from th’ entire point. Will you have her?\n\nShe is herself a dowry.\n\nBurgundy Royal King,\n\nGive but that portion which yourself proposed,\n\nAnd there I take Cordelia by the hand,\n\nDuchess of Burgundy.\n\nLear Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.\n\nBurgundy I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father\n\nThat you must lose a husband.\n\nCordelia Peace be with Burgundy!\n\nSince that respect and fortunes are his love,\n\nI shall not be his wife.\n\nFrance Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;\n\nMost choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!\n\nThee and thy virtues here I seize upon:\n\nBe it lawful I take up what’s cast away.\n\nGods, gods! ’Tis strange that from their cold’st neglect\n\nMy love should kindle to inflamed respect.\n\nThy dowerless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,\n\nIs queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.\n\nNot all the dukes of waterish Burgundy\n\nCan buy this unprized precious maid of me.\n\nBid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:\n\nThou losest here, a better where to find.\n\nLear Though hast her, France; let her be thine; for we\n\nHave no such daughter, nor shall ever see\n\nThat face of hers again; therefore be gone\n\nWithout our grace, our love, our benison.\n\nCome, noble Burgundy.\n\n[ Flourish. Exeunt  Lear, Burgundy, Cornwall, Albany,\n\nGloucester,  and Attendants ]\n\nFrance Bid farewell to your sisters.\n\nCordelia The jewels of our father, with washed eyes\n\nCordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;\n\nAnd like a sister am most loath to call\n\nYour faults as they are named. Love well our father:\n\nTo your professed bosoms I commit him:\n\nBut yet, alas, stood I within his grace,\n\nI would prefer him to a better place.\n\nSo farewell to you both.\n\nRegan Prescribe not us our duty.\n\nGoneril Let your study\n\nBe to content your lord, who hath received you\n\nAt fortune’s alms; you have obedience scanted,\n\nAnd well are worth the want that you have wanted.\n\nCordelia Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides;\n\nWho cover faults, at last shame them derides.\n\nWell may you prosper!\n\nFrance Come, my fair Cordelia.\n\n[ Exeunt  France  and  Cordelia ]\n\nGoneril Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most\n\nnearly appertains to us both. I think our father will hence\n\nto-night.\n\nRegan That’s most certain, and with you; next month with\n\nus.\n\nGoneril You see how full of changes his age is; the\n\nobservation we have made of it hath not been little: he\n\nalways loved our sister most; and with what poor judgment\n\nhe hath now cast her off appears too grossly.\n\nRegan ’Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but\n\nslenderly known himself.\n\nGoneril The best and soundest of his time hath been but\n\nrash; then must we look from his age to receive not alone\n\nthe imperfections of long-engraffed condition, but\n\ntherewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and\n\ncholeric years bring with them.\n\nRegan Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him\n\nas this of Kent’s banishment.\n\nGoneril There is further compliment of leave-taking between\n\nFrance and him. Pray you, let us hit together: if our father\n\ncarry authority with such disposition as he bears, this last\n\nsurrender of his will but offend us.\n\nRegan We shall further think of it.\n\nGoneril We must do something, and i’ th ’heat.",

O\n\nheavens, that this treason were not, or not I the detector!\n\nCornwall Go with me to the Duchess.\n\nEdmund If the matter of this paper be certain, you have\n\nmighty business in hand.\n\nCornwall True or false, it hath made thee Earl of\n\nGloucester.

Pray, innocent, and beware the foul\n\nfiend.\n\nFool Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a\n\ngentleman or a yeoman?\n\nLear A king, a king!\n\nFool No; he’s a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son; for\n\nhe’s a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before\n\nhim.\n\nLear To have a thousand with red burning spits\ni’ th’ night?\n\nLet pity not believe it!’ There she shook\n\nThe holy water from her heavenly eyes,\n\nAnd clamour moistened, then away she started\n\nTo deal with grief alone.\n\nKent It is the stars,\n\nThe stars above us, govern our conditions;\n\nElse one self mate and make could not beget\n\nSuch different issues. You spoke not with her since?\n\nGentleman No.\n\nKent Was this before the King returned?\n\nGentleman No, since.\n\nKent Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear’s i’ th’ town;\n\nWho sometime, in his better tune, remembers\n\nWhat we are come about, and by no means\n\nWill yield to see his daughter.\n\nGentleman Why, good sir?\n\nKent A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,\n\nThat stripped her from his benediction, turned her\n\nTo foreign casualties, gave her dear rights\n\nTo his dog-hearted daughters: these things sting\n\nHis mind so venomously that burning shame\n\nDetains him from Cordelia.\n\nGentleman Alack, poor gentleman!\n\nKent Of Albany’s and Cornwall’s powers you heard not?\n\nGentleman ’Tis so, they are afoot.\n\nKent Well, sir, I’ll bring you to our master Lear,\n\nAnd leave you to attend him.

Edmund, I think, is gone,\n\nIn pity of his misery, to dispatch\n\nHis nighted life; moreover, to descry\n\nThe strength o ’th’ enemy.\n\nOswald I needs must after him, madam, with my letter.\n\nRegan Our troops set forth to-morrow; stay with us,\n\nThe ways are dangerous.\n\nOswald I may not, madam;\n\nMy lady charged my duty in this business.\n\nRegan Why should she write to Edmund?

I know you are of her bosom.\n\nOswald I, madam!\n\nRegan I speak in understanding: y’are, I know’t:\n\nTherefore I do advise you, take this note:\n\nMy lord is dead; Edmund and I have talked;\n\nAnd more convenient is he for my hand\n\nThan for your lady’s. You may gather more.\n\nIf you do find him, pray you give him this,\n\nAnd when your mistress hears thus much from you,\n\nI pray desire her call her wisdom to her:\n\nSo, fare you well.\n\nIf you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,\n\nPreferment falls on him that cuts him off.\n\nOswald Would I could meet him, madam: I should show\n\nWhat party I do follow.\n\nRegan Fare thee well.\n\n[ Exeunt ]\n\nScene 6\n\nThe country near Dover.

How fearful\n\nAnd dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low!\n\nThe crows and choughs that wing the midway air\n\nShow scarce so gross as beetles; halfway down\n\nHangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!\n\nMethinks he seems no bigger than his head.\n\nThe fishermen that walk upon the beach\n\nAppear like mice, and yond tall anchoring bark\n\nDiminished to her cock; her cock a buoy\n\nAlmost too small for sight.

Speak!\n\nThus might he pass indeed; yet he revives.\n\nWhat are you, sir?\n\nGloucester Away, and let me die.\n\nEdgar Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,\n\nSo many fathom down precipitating,\n\nThou’ dst shivered like an egg; but thou dost breathe,\n\nHast heavy substance, bleed’ st not, speak’ st, art sound.\n\nTen masts at each make not the altitude\n\nWhich thou hast perpendicularly fell:\n\nThy life’s a miracle. Speak yet again.\n\nGloucester But have I fallen or no?\n\nEdgar From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.\n\nLook up a-height: the shrill-gorged lark so far\n\nCannot be seen or heard: do but look up.\n\nGloucester Alack! I have no eyes.\n\nIs wretchedness deprived that benefit\n\nTo end itself by death? ’Twas yet some comfort,\n\nWhen misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage,\n\nAnd frustrate his proud will.\n\nEdgar Give me your arm:\n\nUp: so; how is’t? Feel you your legs? You stand.\n\nGloucester Too well, too well.\n\nEdgar This is above all strangeness.\n\nUpon the crown o’ th’ cliff what thing was that\n\nWhich parted from you?\n\nGloucester A poor unfortunate beggar.\n\nEdgar As I stood here below, methought his eyes\n\nWere two full moons; he had a thousand noses,\n\nHorns whelked and waved like the enridged sea:\n\nIt was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,\n\nThink that the clearest gods, who make them honours\n\nOf men’s impossibilities, have preserved thee.\n\nGloucester I do remember now; henceforth I’ll bear\n\nAffliction till it do cry out itself\n\n‘Enough, enough,’ and die. That thing you speak of\n\nI took it for a man; often ’twould say\n\n‘The fiend, the fiend’: he led me to that place.\n\nEdgar Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?\n\n[ Enter  Lear,  fantastically dressed with wild flowers ]\n\nThe safer sense will ne’ er accommodate\n\nHis master thus.\n\nLear No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the King\n\nhimself.\n\nEdgar O, thou side-piercing sight!\n\nLear Nature’s above art in that respect. There’s your press-\n\nmoney. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper: draw\n\nme a clothier’s yard. Look, look! a mouse. Peace, peace! This\n\npiece of toasted cheese will do’t. There’s my gauntlet; I’ll\n\nprove it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. Oh, well flown\n\nbird; i’ th’ clouts i’ th’ clout: hewgh! Give the word.\n\nEdgar Sweet marjoram.\n\nLear Pass.\n\nGloucester I know that voice.\n\nLear Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered me\n\nlike a dog, and told me I had the white hairs in my beard ere\n\nthe black ones were there. To say ‘ay’ and ‘no’ to every thing\n\nthat I said! ‘Ay’ and ‘no’ too was no good divinity. When the\n\nrain came to wet me once and the wind to make me chatter,\n\nwhen the thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I\n\nfound ’em, there I smelt ’em out. Go to, they are not men\n\no’ their words: they told me I was every thing; ’tis a lie, I am\n\nnot ague-proof.\n\nGloucester The trick of that voice I do well remember:\n\nIs’t not the King?\n\nLear Ay, every inch a king:\n\nWhen I do stare, see how the subject quakes.\n\nI pardon that man’s life. What was thy cause?\n\nAdultery?\n\nThou shalt not die; die for adultery! No:\n\nThe wren goes to’t, and the small gilded fly\n\nDoes lecher in my sight.\n\nLet copulation thrive; for Gloucester’s bastard son\n\nWas kinder to his father than my daughters\n\nGot ’tween the lawful sheets.\n\nTo’t, luxury, pell-mell! For I lack soldiers.\n\nBehold yond simp’ring dame,\n\nWhose face between her forks presages snow;\n\nThat minces virtue, and does shake the head\n\nTo hear of pleasure’s name;\n\nThe fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to’t\n\nWith a more riotous appetite.\n\nDown from the waist they are Centaurs,\n\nThough women all above:\n\nBut to the girdle do the gods inherit,\n\nBeneath is all the fiends’: there’s hell, there’s darkness,\n\nThere is the sulphurous pit, burning, scalding,\n\nStench, consumption; fie, fie, fie! pah, pah!\n\nGive me an ounce of civet, good apothecary,\n\nTo sweeten my imagination.\n\nThere’s money for thee.\n\nGloucester O, let me kiss that hand.\n\nLear Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.\n\nGloucester O ruined piece of nature! This great world\n\nShall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?\n\nLear I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny\n\nat me?\n\nNo, do thy worst, blind Cupid; I’ll not love.\n\nRead thou this challenge; mark but the penning of it.\n\nGloucester Were all thy letters suns, I could not see.\n\nEdgar [ aside ] I would not take this from report; it is,\n\nAnd my heart breaks at it.\n\nLear Read.\n\nGloucester What, with the case of eyes?\n\nLear O, ho! are you there with me? No eyes in your head,\n\nnor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case,\n\nyour purse in a light: yet you see how this world goes.\n\nGloucester I see it feelingly.\n\nLear What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes\n\nwith no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond justice rails\n\nupon simple thief. Hark, in thine ear: change places,\n\nand, handy-dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief?\n\nThou hast seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar?\n\nGloucester Ay, sir.\n\nLear And the creature run from the cur? There thou\n\nmight’st behold\n\nThe great image of Authority:\n\nA dog’s obeyed in office.\n\nThou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!\n\nWhy dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;\n\nThou hotly lusts to use her in that kind\n\nFor which thou whip’st her. The usurer hangs the\n\ncozener.\n\nThrough tattered clothes small vices do appear;\n\nRobes and furred gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,\n\nAnd the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:\n\nArm it in rags, a pigmy’s straw does pierce it.\n\nNone does offend, none, I say, none; I’ll able ’em:\n\nTake that of me, my friend, who have the power\n\nTo seal the accuser’s lips. Get thee glass eyes;\n\nAnd, like a scurvy politician, seem\n\nTo see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now;\n\nPull off my boots; harder, harder; so.\n\nEdgar [ aside ] O, matter and impertinency mixed;\n\nReason in madness.\n\nLear If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes;\n\nI know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester;\n\nThou must be patient; we came crying hither:\n\nThou know’st the first time that we smell the air\n\nWe wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.\n\nGloucester Alack, alack the day!\n\nLear When we are born, we cry that we are come\n\nTo this great stage of fools. This’ s a good block!\n\nIt were a delicate stratagem to shoe\n\nA troop of horse with felt; I’ll put’ t in proof,\n\nAnd when I have stolen upon these sons-in-law,\n\nThen, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!\n\n[ Enter a  Gentleman,  with Attendants ]\n\nGentleman O, here he is; lay hand upon him. Sir,\n\nYour most dear daughter –\n\nLear No rescue? What! a prisoner! I am even\n\nThe natural fool of fortune. Use me well;\n\nYou shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;\n\nI am cut to the brains.\n\nGentleman You shall have any thing.\n\nLear No seconds? All myself?\n\nWhy this would make a man a man of salt,\n\nTo use his eyes for garden water-pots,\n\nAy, and laying autumn’s dust. I will die bravely,\n\nLike a smug bridegroom. What! I will be jovial:\n\nCome, come; I am a king, masters, know you that?\n\nGentleman You are a royal one, and we obey you.\n\nLear Then there’s life in’t. Nay, an you get it, you shall get\n\nit by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.\n\n[ Exit running. Attendants follow ]\n\nGentleman A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,\n\nPast speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter,\n\nWho redeems nature from the general curse\n\nWhich twain have brought her to.\n\nEdgar Hail, gentle sir!\n\nGentleman Sir, speed you: what’s your will?\n\nEdgar Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?\n\nGentleman Most sure and vulgar; every one hears that,\n\nWhich can distinguish sound.\n\nEdgar But, by your favour,\n\nHow near’s the other army?\n\nGentleman Near, and on speedy foot; the main descry\n\nStands on the hourly thought.\n\nEdgar I thank you, sir: that’s all.\n\nGentleman Though that the Queen on special cause is here,\n\nHer army is moved on.\n\nEdgar I thank you, sir.\n\n[ Exit  Gentleman ]\n\nGloucester You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me:\n\nLet not my worser spirit tempt me again\n\nTo die before you please!\n\nEdgar Well pray you, father.\n\nGloucester Now, good sir, what are you?\n\nEdgar A most poor man, made tame to fortune’s blows;\n\nWho, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,\n\nAm pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,\n\nI’ll lead you to some biding.\n\nGloucester Hearty thanks:\n\nThe bounty and the benison of heaven\n\nTo boot, and boot!\n\n[ Enter  Oswald ]\n\nOswald A proclaimed prize!

[ The Attendant goes ]\n\n[ Oswald  enters ]\n\nOh, you, sir. You. Come here, sir. Who am I, sir?\n\nOswald My lady’s father.\n\nLear “My lady’s father”! My lord’s lackey, you lousy dog!\n\nYou wretch! You cur!\n\nOswald I am none of these, my lord; I beg your pardon.\n\nLear Do you exchange looks with me, you rascal? [ He strikes\n\nOswald  angrily ]\n\nOswald I won’t be struck, my lord.\n\nKent Or tripped, either, you contemptible lout? [ Oswald  falls\n\nto the ground ]\n\nLear Thank you, fellow. You’re my servant, and I’ll take care\n\nof you.\n\nKent [ to  Oswald ] Come on, sir, get up and go! I’ll teach you\n\nyour place! Be off with you: go! If you want to be stretched\n\nout full length again, stay. But away with you! Use your\n\ncommon sense. [ Oswald  runs off ] That’s right.\n\nLear Now, my friendly fellow, thank you: there’s something\n\non account. [ He gives  Kent  some money ]\n\n[ The  Fool  enters ]\n\nFool Let me hire him too: here’s my coxcomb. [ He offers  Kent\n\nhis jester’s cap, which resembles a cock’s comb in shape\n\nand color ]\n\nLear Hello, there, my pretty fellow! How have you been?\n\nFool Sir, you had better have my coxcomb.\n\nKent Why, Fool?\n\nFool Why? For siding with someone who’s out of favor. No,\n\nif you can’t side with the winners, you’ll be in trouble\n\nshortly. So there: take my coxcomb. Why, this fellow\n\n[ indicating  Lear ] has alienated two of his daughters and\n\ndone the third one a blessing without intending to. If you\n\njoin his service, you’ll have to wear my coxcomb. [ To  Lear ]\n\nGreetings, uncle. I wish I had two coxcombs and two\n\ndaughters.\n\nLear Why, my boy?\n\nFool If I gave them all my possessions, I’d keep my coxcombs\n\nfor myself. [ He offers his cap to  Lear ] There’s mine. Beg the\n\nsecond off your daughters.\n\nLear Watch it, now: you’ll be whipped!\n\nFool Truth is a dog that’s sent to his kennel. He gets whipped,\n\nwhereas flattery, the hound bitch, is allowed to stand in\n\nfront of the fire, and stink.\n\nLear [ brooding ] It’s quite insufferable!\n\nFool Sir, I’ll tell you something.\n\nLear Do.\n\nFool Listen carefully, uncle:\n\nOwn more than you show,\n\nDon’t tell all you know,\n\nLend less than you’ve got,\n\nRide more than you trot,\n\nDon’t believe all you’re told,\n\nDon’t risk all your gold;\n\nGive up drink and your whores,\n\nDon’t stray out of doors,\n\nAnd you will have more\n\nThan two tens to the score.\n\nKent This is a lot of nothing, Fool.\n\nFool Then it’s like the advice of a lawyer working without\n\na fee: you get it for nothing. Can’t you make use of nothing,\n\nuncle?\n\nLear Why no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing.\n\nFool [ to  Kent ] Do me a favor. Tell him that’s what his\n\nincome amounts to. He won’t believe a Fool.\n\nLear A bitter Fool!\n\nFool [ to  Lear ] Do you know the difference, my boy, between a\n\nbitter Fool and a sweet one?\n\nLear No, lad, tell me.\n\nFool Whoever counselled you\n\nTo give away your land,\n\nCome place him here by me,\n\nWhile you for him there stand:\n\nThe sweet and bitter fool\n\nWill instantly appear;\n\nThe one in motley here –\n\nThe other standing there!\n\n[ He points to  Lear  as the bitter one ]\n\nLear Are you calling me a fool, boy?\n\nFool All your other titles you have given away. That one you\n\nwere born with.\n\nKent He’s not all fool, my lord.\n\nFool No, indeed. Lords and great men won’t let me be.

[ He’s thinking of regaining the\n\nthrone ] Monstrous ingratitude!\n\nFool If you were my Fool, uncle, I’d have you beaten for being\n\nold too soon.\n\nLear How do you mean?\n\nFool You shouldn’t have got old till you’d acquired some\n\nsense.\n\nLear Oh, don’t let me go mad; not mad, sweet heaven! Keep\n\nme sane. I don’t want to be mad!\n\n[ A  Gentleman  enters ]\n\nWell, are the horses ready?\n\nGentleman Ready, my lord.\n\nLear [ to the  Fool ] Come on, boy …\n\nFool [ to the audience ]\n\nThe virgin of today, who laughs at my departure,\n\nWon’t be one much longer, unless something’s cut\n\nshorter.\n\n[ They go ]\n\nAct two\n\nScene 1\n\nInside the castle of the  Earl of Gloucester. Edmund  enters and meets  Curan,  a courtier.\n\nEdmund God be with you, Curan.\n\nCuran And you, sir. I’ve been with your father, and informed\n\nhim that the Duke of Cornwall, and his Duchess Regan, will\n\nbe here with him tonight.\n\nEdmund How has that come about?\n\nCuran I don’t know. You’ve heard the latest? I mean the\n\nrumors, since at the moment they’re only idle gossip.\n\nEdmund No, I haven’t. What are they?\n\nCuran Haven’t you heard of the impending wars between the\n\nDukes of Cornwall and Albany?\n\nEdmund Not a word.\n\nCuran You probably will soon. Fare you well, sir.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nEdmund The Duke coming here tonight! So much the better!\n\nMarvelous! This fits in with my scheme. My father has\n\nhidden himself to overhear my brother and I’ve got some\n\ndelicate business to do. Speed and good fortune, come\n\nto my aid! [ He calls up the adjacent stairs ] Brother, a word\n\nwith you! Come down! Brother, I say!\n\n[ Edgar  descends ]\n\n[ To the audience ] My father is watching. [ Whispering to\n\nEdgar,  and assuming an agitated manner ] Sir, run away!\n\nYour hiding place has been discovered. You have the\n\nadvantage of night cover. Have you not been speaking out\n\nagainst the Duke of Cornwall? He’s coming here now,\n\novernight, in great haste, and Regan is with him. Have you\n\nsaid anything supportive of his case against the Duke of\n\nAlbany? Think hard.\n\nEdgar I’m sure of it. Not a word.\n\nEdmund I can hear my father coming. Excuse me: I must\n\npretend to draw my sword upon you. [ He does so ] Draw\n\nyours. Make as if to defend yourself. [ Edgar,  bewildered,\n\ndoes as he is told ] Do your best. [ Speaking out loud for\n\nGloucester  to hear ] Surrender! Come to my father! Light\n\nthere! [ Whispering ] Run, brother. [ Aloud ] Torches, torches!\n\n[ Pushing  Edgar  out ] So, farewell. [ Edgar  runs off ] Some\n\nblood on me would be convincing evidence of my tough\n\nstruggle. [ He cuts his arm ] I’ve seen drunkards do more than\n\nthis in fun. [ Calling pathetically ] Father, father! [ After  Edgar ]\n\nStop, stop! Will no one help?\n\n[ Gloucester  enters with Servants and torches ]\n\nGloucester Now, Edmund, where’s the villain?\n\nEdmund He was standing here in the dark, his sharp sword\n\ndrawn, mumbling wicked spells, and making incantations to\n\nthe moon to seek her favor.\n\nGloucester But where is he?\n\nEdmund [ playing for time ] Look, sir, I’m bleeding.\n\nGloucester Where is the villain, Edmund?\n\nEdmund [ pointing ] He fled this way, sir, when he was quite\n\nunable –\n\nGloucester Follow him, quick! Go after him! [ Servants rush\n\noff in pursuit ] “Quite unable” to do what?\n\nEdmund Persuade me to murder your lordship. And I told him\n\nthe vengeful gods deal ruthlessly with parricides. I spoke\n\nabout how the bond between father and son was complex\n\nand strong. Sir, in short, seeing how bitterly opposed I was\n\nto his unnatural plan, with a deadly thrust he lunged at my\n\ndefenseless body with his naked sword and wounded my\n\narm. But when he saw my energetic response to the\n\nchallenge, inspired by the justice of the cause – or perhaps\n\naghast at the noise I made – he suddenly ran off.\n\nGloucester No matter how far he goes, there’s nowhere in\n\nthis land where he can stay free. Once found, kill him. The\n\nnoble Duke, my master and chief patron, comes here\n\ntonight. With his authority I’ll announce that whoever finds\n\nhim will be rewarded for bringing the murderous coward to\n\nhis execution. For anyone who hides him, death!\n\nEdmund When I tried to dissuade him from his plan, and\n\nfound he was determined to proceed, with angry words I\n\nthreatened to expose him. He replied, “You poverty-stricken\n\nbastard! Do you think anyone would believe a word you said\n\nif I spoke to the contrary? No. I’d deny it all – indeed I\n\nwould, even if you produced my own handwriting – and say\n\nit was your scheme, plot and treacherous proposal. People\n\nwould have to be very stupid not to see that the profits from\n\nmy death give you an obvious and powerful motive for\n\nseeking it.”\n\nGloucester Oh, that unnatural and confirmed villain! He’d\n\ndeny his letter, did he say? He’s no child of mine.\n\n[ The  Duke of Cornwall’s  trumpet-call is heard ]\n\nListen! The Duke’s trumpets. I don’t know why he’s come.\n\nI’ll block all seaports. The villain won’t escape. The Duke\n\nmust grant me that. Also, I’ll send a picture of him far and\n\nwide so that all the kingdom will take note of him. And I’ll\n\ndevise a way of your inheriting my lands, you loyal and true\n\nson.\n\n[ Cornwall, Regan  and their Attendants enter ]\n\nCornwall Greetings, my noble friend! Since I arrived just\n\nnow, I’ve heard strange news.\n\nRegan If it’s true, no vengeance is adequate in pursuit of the\n\noffender. How are you, my lord?\n\nGloucester Oh, madam, my old heart is broken. It’s broken!\n\nRegan What, did my father’s godson seek your life? The one\n\nmy father named: your Edgar?\n\nGloucester Oh, lady, lady. Shame would have it hidden.\n\nRegan Wasn’t he a companion of the riotous knights who\n\nserved my father?\n\nGloucester I don’t know, madam. It’s too awful. Too awful.\n\nEdmund [ taking his cue from Regan ] Yes, madam, he was one\n\nof that lot.\n\nRegan No wonder, then, that he was so disloyal. They’ve\n\nincited him to plan the old man’s death, so that he can\n\nsquander his wealth. Just this very evening I’ve been told\n\nabout them by my sister, with such warnings that if they\n\ncome to stay at my house, I won’t be there.\n\nCornwall Nor I, Regan, that’s for sure. Edmund, I hear you\n\nhave behaved like a good son to your father.\n\nEdmund It was my duty, sir.\n\nGloucester He revealed Edgar’s plot, and received the wound\n\nyou see while trying to arrest him.\n\nCornwall Is he being pursued?\n\nGloucester Yes, my good lord.\n\nCornwall If he’s captured, never fear his doing harm again.\n\nMake your own plans, using my resources as you please. As\n\nfor you, Edmund, whose virtuous loyalty is so commendable\n\nat this present time, you shall be one of us. Trustworthy\n\nnatures such as yours we have great need of. We seize upon\n\nyour services.\n\nEdmund [ bowing ] I shall serve you truly, sir, whatever else.\n\nGloucester On his behalf I thank your Grace.\n\nCornwall You don’t know why we came to visit you –\n\nRegan – so unexpectedly, traveling through the darkness of\n\nthe night. Business of some importance, Gloucester,\n\nrequiring your advice. Our father has written to us – and so\n\nhas our sister – about certain quarrels. I thought it best to\n\nanswer him away from home. The messengers are waiting\n\nto be dispatched. Our good old friend, be of good cheer, and\n\ngive us your much-needed advice about these matters,\n\nwhich require instant action.\n\nGloucester Your servant, madam. Your Graces are most\n\nwelcome.\n\n[ Trumpets sound as they leave ]\n\nScene 2\n\nOutside Gloucester’s castle.  Kent  and  Oswald  meet. Dawn has not yet broken.\n\nOswald Good morning to you, friend. Are you a servant here?\n\nKent Yes.\n\nOswald Where may we put our horses?\n\nKent In the mud.\n\nOswald Please, if you love me, tell me.\n\nKent I don’t love you.\n\nOswald Well, then, I don’t much care for you.\n\nKent Any more of your lip, and I’ll make you care.\n\nOswald Why the abuse? I don’t know you.\n\nKent I know you, man.\n\nOswald What do you know of me?\n\nKent You’re a rogue, a rascal, a scrap-food guzzler. A low,\n\nproud, shallow, beggarly, scruffy, upstart of a dirty, shabby,\n\ncowardly, officious, mincing rogue. A down-and-out slave.\n\nA man who’d be a pimp to get a good job, and who’s\n\nnothing but a mixture of knave, beggar, coward, procurer,\n\nand the son and heir of a mongrel bitch. A fellow I’ll beat till\n\nhe shrieks if he denies one syllable of what I’ve said!\n\nOswald Why, what a terrible fellow you are, to curse\n\nsomeone who is neither known to you, nor knows you!\n\nKent What a hard-faced rascal you are, to deny you know me!\n\nIs it two days since I tripped you up in front of the King?\n\nDraw your sword, you rogue, ’cos though it may be night,\n\nthe moon’s shining. I’ll pierce you so the moonlight shines\n\nthrough you! [ He draws ] You lousy, rascally phony! Draw!\n\nOswald Go away! I’ll have nothing to do with you!\n\nKent Draw, you rascal! You’re here with letters critical of the\n\nKing, and you side with Lady Stuck-Up against her royal\n\nfather. Draw, you rogue, or I’ll give you a real roasting!\n\nDraw, you rascal! Come on!\n\nOswald Help! Murder! Help!\n\nKent Fight, you coward! Stand your ground, you rogue! You\n\nfoppish coward, fight! [ He beats  Oswald  with the flat of his\n\nsword ]\n\nOswald Help! Murder! Murder!\n\n[ Edmund  enters with his rapier drawn ]\n\nEdmund Hey, what’s all this about? Break!\n\nKent I’ll deal with you, young shaver, if you like! Come on, I’ll\n\nteach you a few things! Come on, laddie! [ He challenges\n\nEdmund  too ]\n\n[ Cornwall  enters, with  Regan, Gloucester  and Servants ]\n\nGloucester Weapons! Fighting! What’s all this?\n\nCornwall No more, upon your lives: the next to strike dies!\n\nWhat’s the matter?\n\nRegan They are the messengers from our sister and the King.\n\nCornwall What’s the quarrel? Speak.\n\nOswald I’m out of breath, my lord.\n\nKent No wonder; your courage was so aroused. You cowardly\n\nrascal, you’re not natural. Some tailor stitched you together.\n\nCornwall You’re an odd fellow. A tailor make a man?\n\nKent Yes, a tailor, sir. A stone-cutter or a painter couldn’t\n\nhave done such a botched job, even if he’d only been\n\nworking for a couple of years.\n\nCornwall So tell me, how did your quarrel start?\n\nOswald This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared on\n\naccount of his grey beard –\n\nKent You useless wretch! You good-for-nothing! My lord,\n\nwith your permission I’ll grind this coarse villain into mortar,\n\nand plaster the wall of a privy with him. Spare my grey\n\nbeard, you dodo bird?\n\nCornwall Quiet, man! You uncouth hooligan: have you no\n\nrespect?\n\nKent Yes, sir. But anger takes precedent.\n\nCornwall Why are you so angry?\n\nKent Because such a wretch as this should display a sword\n\nbut not show any honesty. Smiling rogues such as these\n\noften gnaw like rats through bonds of love that are too tight\n\nto be undone by other means. They satisfy the lusts of their\n\ndebauched masters. They add fuel to anger; they bring chill\n\nto moods of dejection; they deny, affirm, and turn with\n\nthe wind according to their masters’ moods – knowing\n\nnothing but how to follow, like dogs. Damn your twitching\n\nface! Are you laughing at me, as if I were a fool? You goose,\n\nif you were on Salisbury Plain I’d make you cackle your way\n\nback home to Winchester.\n\nCornwall What, are you mad, old fellow?\n\nGloucester How did you come to quarrel? Explain that.\n\nKent No two men hate each other more than I and that rogue.\n\nCornwall Why do you call him a rogue? What has he done\n\nwrong?\n\nKent I don’t like his face.\n\nCornwall Or mine, or his, or hers, probably.\n\nKent Sir, I’m a plain man. I have seen better faces in my time\n\nthan any I see before me now.\n\nCornwall This is a fellow who, having been praised for\n\nbluntness, has assumed a cheeky impertinence; but he\n\nmisuses it. [ Sarcastically ] Oh no, he can’t flatter. Not he!\n\nHe has a plain, honest mind. He has to speak the truth. If\n\npeople will take it, fine. If not, it’s just his way. I know\n\nthese rogues. Behind this bluntness they conceal more\n\ncraftiness, and have corrupter purposes, than twenty\n\ngroveling bootlickers who never put a foot wrong.\n\nKent [ mockingly overpolite ] Sir, in all good faith, in sincere\n\ntruthfulness, with the gracious approval of your mightiness,\n\nwhose power – like the great ball of fire round the sun –\n\nCornwall [ interrupting ] What’s your game?\n\nKent [ reverting to normality ] To change my manner of\n\nspeech, which you disapprove of so much: I know, sir, that\n\nI’m no flatterer. The man who tricked you with plain-\n\nspeaking was a plain rogue. That I’ll never be, even if you\n\nbegged me and I risked your displeasure by turning you\n\ndown.\n\nCornwall [ to  Oswald ] What offense did you give him?\n\nOswald I didn’t give him any. Recently, through a\n\nmisunderstanding, his master the King chose to strike me.\n\nThen, backing his Majesty up and pandering to his anger, he\n\ntripped me from behind. While I was down, he insulted me,\n\nabused me, and made himself out to be such a hero that he\n\ngot credit from it, and was praised by the King for tackling a\n\nman who was offering no aggression. And, inspired by this\n\namazing achievement, he drew on me here again.\n\nKent All rogues and cowards think the noble Ajax is a coward\n\ncompared with them.\n\nCornwall Bring the stocks here! You fierce old rogue, you\n\nelderly braggart! We’ll teach you!\n\nKent Sir, I’m too old to learn. Don’t call your stocks for me. I\n\nserve the King, on whose business I was sent to you. In\n\nstocking his messenger, you would be showing scant\n\nrespect, insulting the King personally, and his office.\n\nCornwall Bring the stocks! Upon my life and honor, he’ll sit\n\nthere till noon.\n\nRegan Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too.\n\nKent Why, madam, if I were your father’s dog you wouldn’t\n\ntreat me like that.\n\nRegan Sir, you being his stooge, I will.\n\nCornwall This is a fellow of the very sort our sister wrote\n\nabout. Come, bring along the stocks.\n\n[ They are carried in ]\n\nGloucester Let me plead with your Grace not to do this. He’s\n\ngreatly at fault, and the good King, his master, will rebuke\n\nhim for it. The undignified punishment you propose is the\n\nsort that the most disreputable and discredited wretches are\n\npunished with, for petty pilfering and minor misdemeanors.\n\nThe King won’t take kindly to having his messenger\n\nshackled like this.\n\nCornwall I’ll answer for that.\n\nRegan My sister might be far more offended, having her\n\nservant abused and assaulted for carrying out her business.\n\nPut his legs in.\n\n[ Kent  is put in the stocks ]\n\nCornwall Let’s go, my lord.\n\n[ All but  Gloucester  and  Kent  leave ]\n\nGloucester I’m sorry for you, friend. It’s the Duke’s whim. As\n\nall the world well knows, his temperament will brook no\n\nrestraint or obstacle. I’ll plead for you.\n\nKent Please don’t, sir. I’ve gone without sleep and traveled a\n\nrough road. I’ll sleep away some of the time; the rest I’ll\n\nwhistle. Even a good man’s fortunes can get down at the\n\nheels. Good day to you!\n\nGloucester The Duke’s at fault in this. It will be taken badly.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nKent Good King, who should have heeded the old proverb:\n",

Horses are tied by the heads, dogs and\n\nbears by the neck, monkeys by the waist, and men by the\n\nlegs. When a man gets too frisky, then he has to wear\n\nwooden stockings.\n\nLear Who has so mistaken your status that he has placed you\n\nhere?\n\nKent lt’s both “he” and “she”: your son-in-law and daughter.\n\nLear No.\n\nKent Yes.\n\nLear No, I say!\n\nKent I say yes.\n\nLear No, no. They would not!\n\nKent Yes, yes. They have.\n\nLear By Jupiter, I swear no!\n\nKent By Juno, I swear yes.\n\nLear They wouldn’t dare do it. They could not – would\n\nnot – do it! It’s worse than murder to do such a violent\n\noutrage against the King’s officer. Tell me, with reasonable\n\nhaste, how you could have deserved – or they imposed –\n\nthis treatment, coming as you did from me.\n\nKent My lord, when I delivered your Highness’s letters to\n\nthem at their home, I’d no sooner risen from my bow than a\n\nsweating courier, anxious in his haste, half breathless, came\n\npanting greetings from his mistress Goneril. He delivered\n\nletters, ignoring the fact that he was interrupting me, which\n\nthey read at once. On noting the contents, they summoned\n\ntheir servants and immediately took to their horses. They\n\nordered me to follow and await an answer at their leisure.\n\nThey gave me cold looks. So when I met the other\n\nmessenger here – whose welcome, I realized, had poisoned\n\nmine – and observed that he was the very same fellow who\n\nhad recently behaved so insolently before your Highness,\n\nhaving more courage than sense, I drew my sword. He\n\nawakened the servants with his loud and cowardly cries.\n\nYour son-in-law and daughter found this offense worthy of\n\nthe shame I’m now suffering.\n\nFool Winter isn’t over while there are wild geese about like\n\nthat!\n\nFathers who’ve no money\n\nHave children who ignore ‘em.\n\nBut fathers who are rich\n\nHave children who adore ‘em.\n\nLuck, that shameless whore,\n\nNever helps the poor.\n\nSo, you’ll have more income [ a pun : dolours ( sorrows )\n\nversus dollars ( money )] from your daughters than you can\n\ncope with in one year.\n\nLear Oh, how this smothering feeling spreads up towards my\n\nheart! [ He opens his collar ] The choking disease! Stay down,\n\nyou spreading sorrow, keep your lowly place! Where is this\n\ndaughter?\n\nKent With the Earl, sir, indoors.\n\nLear Don’t follow me. Stay here.\n\n[ He rushes off ]\n\nGentleman Did you really give no more offense than that?\n\nKent None. How come the King has so few with him?\n\nFool If you’d been put in the stocks for that question, you\n\nwould have well deserved it.\n\nKent Why, Fool?\n\nFool You must learn from the ant: there’s nothing to be\n\ngained from toiling on behalf of a lost cause. All who follow\n\ntheir noses are guided by their eyes, except blind men, and\n\nmost of them can smell a man who stinks. When a huge\n\nwheel runs down a hill, don’t hold onto it lest you break your\n\nneck trying to keep up with it. When it’s going upwards,\n\nthough, let it pull you with it. When a wise man gives you\n\nbetter advice, return mine. It’s really only for knaves, since\n\nit’s given by a Fool.\n\nThe man who works in hope of gain,\n\nAnd has no sense of loyalty,\n\nWill quit when fortune’s on the wane,\n\nAnd leave you in calamity.\n\nBut I won’t leave. The Fool will stay,\n\nAnd let the wise man go;\n\nThe knave turns Fool who runs away;\n\nThis Fool’s no knave, you know.\n\nKent Where did you learn this, Fool?",

You\n\nmust be quick now.\n\nAlbany We’ll rise to the challenge.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nEdmund I have sworn my love to both these sisters. Each is\n\nsuspicious of the other, as those who are stung are wary\n\nof the snake. Which of them shall I have? Both? One? Or\n\nneither? Neither can be enjoyed if both remain alive. To take\n\nthe widow would exasperate, infuriate, her sister Goneril.\n\nBut with her husband still alive, I wouldn’t find it easy to\n\nplay a winning game. So for now we’ll use him as a front\n\nman in the battle. When that’s over, it’s up to her who\n\nwants to be rid of him to work out how to see him off. As\n\nfor the mercy he intends to show Lear and Cordelia, once\n\nthe battle’s over and they are at our mercy, they’ll never see\n\nhis pardon. My interests are best served by action rather\n\nthan thought.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\nScene 2\n\nA field between the two camps. Noises of war.  Lear  and  Cordelia  cross the stage with some of their army, and leave.  Edgar  enters with  Gloucester .\n\nEdgar Here, father, shelter in the shade of this hospitable\n\ntree. Pray that right triumphs. If ever I return to you again,\n\nI’ll bring you comforting news.\n\nGloucester Grace go with you, sir!\n\n[ Edgar leaves ]\n\n[ The sounds of war grow louder. A retreat is sounded.\n\nEdgar  returns, dismayed ]\n\nEdgar We must go, old man! Give me your hand. [ He tries to\n\npull  Gloucester  to his feet ] Let’s go! King Lear has lost. He\n\nand his daughter have been captured. Give me your hand.\n\nCome on!\n\nGloucester [ resisting ] No further, sir. A man can die well\n\nenough here.\n\nEdgar What, depressed again? Men must endure dying just as\n\nthey do being born. Being prepared for it is what matters.\n\nCome on.\n\nGloucester That’s true, too.\n\n[ He rises to his feet and they leave ]\n\nScene 3\n\nThe British camp near Dover. Drums and flags herald the entrance of  Edmund  in victory, and  Lear  and  Cordelia  in defeat, as prisoners. Soldiers guard them.\n\nEdmund Some officers take them away. Guard them well, till\n\nthe wishes of our leaders, who will decide their fate, are\n\nknown.\n\nCordelia We are not the first to suffer the worst from the best\n\nof intentions. For you – a suffering King – I am defeated: for\n\nmyself I could have faced ill fortune and won. Shall we see\n\nthese “daughters,” these “sisters”?\n\nLear No, no, no, no! Come, let’s be off to prison. We two,\n\nalone, will sing like birds in a cage. When you ask a blessing\n\nof me, I’ll kneel down and ask your forgiveness. That way\n\nwe’ll live, and pray, and sing; and tell each other tales of\n\ndays gone by; and laugh at courtiers in their fancy clothes;\n\nand hear poor wretches discusss the news from court. And\n\nwe’ll talk with them, too: who has failed, and who\n\nsucceeded; who’s in favor, and who’s out; and – as if we\n\nwere God’s spies – solve the mysteries of the universe. In\n\nthe confines of our prison, we’ll outlast many a gang of\n\nhigh and mighty ones, who come and go by the month.\n\nEdmund [ to the Officers ] Take them away.\n\nLear The gods themselves endorse such sacrifices as yours,\n\nCordelia. [ She starts to weep ] Have I made you cry? [ He\n\nputs his arm around her ] To separate us, a man would need\n\na burning torch from heaven – to drive us apart with fire,\n\nlike a fox smoked from its lair. Wipe your eyes. They’ll rot\n\nbefore they’ll make us weep! We’ll see them starved first!\n\nCome!\n\n[ Lear  and  Cordelia  leave under guard ]\n\nEdmund [ to an  Officer ] Come here, Captain. Listen. [ Giving\n\nhim a paper ] Take this note. Follow them to prison. I’ve\n\npromoted you once already. If you follow these instructions,\n\nyou’ll do well for yourself. Know this: men must take\n\nadvantage of their opportunities. To be tender-hearted is not\n\nbecoming in a soldier. This great assignment brooks no\n\nargument: either say you’ll do it, or prosper by some other\n\nmeans.\n\nOfficer I’ll do it, my lord.\n\nEdmund Get on with it then. Consider yourself lucky when\n\nyou’ve done it. Note – I say immediately. Carry it out\n\naccording to my instructions.\n\nOfficer I can’t pull a cart, or live on dried oats like a horse:\n\nso if it’s man’s work, I’ll do it.\n\n[ He goes ]\n\n[ Trumpets sound. Enter  Albany, Goneril, Regan,  Officers\n\nand Soldiers ]\n\nAlbany [ to  Edmund ] Sir, you’ve shown your valiant side\n\ntoday, and fortune has taken care of you. You have the\n\ncaptives who were our enemies in today’s battle: I require\n\nthem from you, to do with them what their deserts, and our\n\nsafety, shall equally determine.\n\nEdmund Sir, I thought it appropriate to send the old and\n\nmiserable King to some confinement, under guard. The\n\nemotional appeal of his age, and even more so his title,\n\ncould win the hearts of the common people, and turn\n\nagainst us the lances of the conscripted soldiers under our\n\ncommand. With him I sent the Queen, for the same reason.\n\nThey are ready tomorrow, or later, to appear wherever you\n\nintend to hold your trial. Right now, we sweat and bleed.\n\nFriend has lost friend. Even the best of causes can be\n\nmisjudged by injured parties acting in the heat of passion.\n\nThe issue of Cordelia and her father requires a more suitable\n\nplace.\n\nAlbany Sir, just a moment. I regard you as a subject in this\n\nwar – not as an equal.\n\nRegan It’s up to us to decide how to rank him. I think our\n\nwishes might have been consulted before you had said so\n\nmuch. He led our armies, and acted with the authority of my\n\nrank and person. Such representation might well stand up\n\nand call itself your equal.\n\nGoneril Not so fast. He ranks higher in his own right than\n\nbecause of any titles you have given him!\n\nRegan In exercising my rights, with my approval, he equates\n\nwith the best.\n\nAlbany That would only be so if he married you.\n\nRegan Many a true word is spoken in jest!\n\nGoneril [ sarcastically ] Well, well, well … That’s seeing\n\nthings straight!\n\nRegan Madam, I am not well: otherwise I’d give you a piece\n\nof my mind. [ To  Edmund ] General, take my soldiers, my\n\nprisoners, my inheritance. Do as you wish with them, and\n\nme. I surrender myself: may the world be witness that I\n\nhereby create you my lord and master.\n\nGoneril Do you intend to marry him?\n\nAlbany [ rebuking his wife sharply ] It’s not for you to say yes\n\nor no!\n\nEdmund Or you, lord –\n\nAlbany Bastard, it is!\n\nRegan [to Edmund ] Let the drum sound and proclaim that\n\nwhat is mine, is yours.\n\nAlbany Hold it: listen to reason! Edmund, I arrest you for\n\ncapital treason; and as your accessory [ he points to\n\nGoneril ], this deceptively beautiful serpent. [ To  Regan ] As\n\nfor your claim, fair sister, I rule it out of order in the interests\n\nof my wife. She’s the one who is under contract to this lord,\n\nand I – her husband – contradict your banns. If you want to\n\nmarry, address your proposals to me. My lady is already\n\nspoken for.\n\nGoneril Such drama!\n\nAlbany You are armed, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound. If\n\nno one appears to prove in combat with you your vile,\n\nundeniable and many treasons, there is my challenge! [ He\n\nthrows down a gauntlet ] I’ll prove it on peril of your life,\n\nbefore ever I break bread again, that you are in every way\n\nwhat I have here described you.\n\nRegan [ holding her forehead ] Sick, oh, I’m sick!\n\nGoneril [ aside ] If not, I’ll never trust poison.\n\nEdmund There’s my response. [ He throws down his own\n\ngauntlet in exchange ] No matter who he is that calls me\n\ntraitor, he lies like a villain! Let the trumpet sound a call.\n\nWhoever dares to come forward, I will defend my truth and\n\nhonor against him, against you, and against anybody.\n\nAlbany [ calling ] A herald, there!\n\nEdmund A herald there, a herald!\n\nAlbany Trust to your personal valor, because your soldiers –\n\nall levied in my name – have accepted their discharge\n\nfrom me.\n\nRegan [ about to fall ] I’m feeling worse.\n\nAlbany She isn’t well. Convey her to my tent. [ Officers\n\nsupport her and lead her out ]\n\n[ A  Herald  enters ]\n\nCome here, herald. Let the trumpet sound, and read this\n\nout. [ He hands over  Edgar’s  challenge ]\n\nOfficer Sound, trumpet! [ A trumpet sounds ]\n\nHerald [ reading ] If any man of rank or distinction, presently\n\nenlisted in the army, will maintain that Edmund, supposed\n\nEarl of Gloucester, is an all-around traitor, let him appear by\n\nthe third sound of the trumpet. He will defend himself\n\nboldly.\n\nSound!\n\n[ The trumpet sounds for the first time ]\n\nAgain!\n\n[ The second trumpet sounds ]\n\nAgain!\n\n[ The third trumpet sounds. There is a pause, and then an\n\nanswering trumpet is heard from nearby.  Edgar  enters,\n\narmed, preceded by a trumpeter ]\n\nAlbany [ to the  Herald ] Ask him what is his purpose in\n\nappearing upon the trumpet call.\n\nHerald Who are you? Your name? Your rank? Why do you\n\nrespond to this summons?\n\nEdgar Know that my name is not on record. Treason has\n\ndestroyed it. Yet I am as noble as the adversary I come to\n\nfight.\n\nAlbany Who is that adversary?\n\nEdgar Who represents Edmund, Earl of Gloucester?\n\nEdmund [ stepping forward ] He himself. What have you to say\n\nto him?\n\nEdgar Draw your sword, so that, if what I have to say offends\n\na noble heart, your valor may bring you justice. Here is\n\nmine. [ He draws his sword from its scabbard ] Behold! To\n\ndraw it is the privilege of my rank, my vows, and my knight-\n\nhood. I declare – notwithstanding your strength, position,\n\nyouth, and eminence, despite your victorious sword, your\n\nbrand-new good fortune, your valor and your\n\ncourage – that you are a traitor! You have betrayed your\n\ngods, your brother and your father. You have conspired\n\nagainst this illustrious high-born prince, and from the top of\n\nyour head to the dust below your feet, you are a most\n\ninfamous traitor! Deny it, and this sword, this arm, and my\n\nbest endeavors are determined to prove to that heart of\n\nyours, to which I speak, that you lie!\n\nEdmund Common sense tells me I should ask your name. But\n\nas your exterior looks so good and valiant, and because your\n\nspeech has a touch of good breeding about it, though I\n\ncould with all propriety postpone this combat – according to\n\nthe rules of knighthood – this I disdainfully refuse to do. I\n\nthrow these accusations of treason back at you, together\n\nwith the hateful-as-hell charge of lying. Though right now\n\nthey pass you by unscathed, my sword will thrust them\n\nhome where they belong, and put them to rest forever.\n\nTrumpets, speak!\n\n[ Edmund  and  Edgar  fight.  Edmund  falls, wounded ]\n\nAlbany Save him! Save him!\n\nGoneril This is trickery, Gloucester. By the code of arms, you\n\nwere not obliged to fight with an unknown enemy. You are\n\nnot defeated, but cheated and deceived!\n\nAlbany Shut your mouth, woman, or I’ll stop it with this\n\nletter. [ It is  Goneril’s  to  Edmund,  the one which  Edgar  found\n\non  Oswald  in Act 4 Scene 6. To  Edgar ] Hold your sword, sir.\n\n[ To  Goneril ] Wicked beyond all words: read your own evil!\n\n[ Goneril  tries to grab the paper ] No snatching, lady! I\n\nsuspect you know what it is.\n\nGoneril What if I do? The law belongs to me, not you. Who\n\ncould prosecute me for it?\n\nAlbany How utterly monstrous! Oh! Do you know this letter?\n\nGoneril [ hysterical now ] Don’t ask me what I know!\n\n[ She leaves, distraught ]\n\nAlbany Follow her. She’s desperate. Take charge of her.\n\n[ An Officer leaves ]\n\nEdmund [ to  Albany ] What you have charged me with, I have\n\ndone: and more, much more. Time will reveal all. It’s over\n\nnow, and so am I. [ To  Edgar ] But who are you, who has the\n\nadvantage over me? If you are noble, I forgive you.\n\nEdgar Let’s exchange courtesies. I am no less noble than you\n\nare, Edmund. If I’m more, you have wronged me all the\n\nmore. My name is Edgar, and I’m your father’s son. The\n\ngods are just. They use the vices we take pleasure in as the\n\nmeans to punish us; conceiving you cost him his eyes.\n\nEdmund You’ve said right. It’s true. The wheel of fortune has\n\nturned a full circle. I am back at the bottom.\n\nAlbany [ to  Edgar ] I thought your very walk suggested a royal\n\nnobleness. My welcome to you. [ They embrace in soldierly\n\nfashion ] May sorrow be my lot if ever I hated you or your\n\nfather.\n\nEdgar Wise prince, I know that.\n\nAlbany Where did you hide yourself? How did you know\n\nabout your father’s sufferings?\n\nEdgar By nursing them, my lord. Listen to a brief story, and\n\nwhen I’ve told it, would that my heart would burst! To\n\nescape the threat of death that was so close upon me – oh,\n\nhow sweet life is, in that we suffer the pain of death by the\n\nhour rather than die suddenly! – I learned to dress in the\n\nrags of a madman, and to assume a character that even\n\ndogs despised. And in this clothing I met my father with his\n\nbleeding sockets, his eyes newly blinded. I became his\n\nguide, led him, begged for him, and saved him from despair.\n\nI never, foolishly, revealed myself to him till some\n\nhalf hour ago, when I was in armor. Not certain of this\n\nfortunate outcome, though hoping for it, I asked his\n\nblessing, and told him of my journeying from first to last. But\n\nhis injured heart, alas, too weak to carry the strain, torn\n\nbetween the two extremes of passion – joy and\n\ngrief – burst with happiness.\n\nEdmund This speech of yours has touched me, and it could\n\nperhaps do some good. Proceed. You look as though you\n\nhave more to say.\n\nAlbany [ to  Edgar ] If there’s more to report that’s more\n\nharrowing, keep it to yourself. I’m almost at the point of\n\ntears, hearing of this.\n\nEdgar Those who cannot cope with sorrow would think of\n\nthis as a breaking-point. To add more woe by giving details\n\nwould generate further suffering, and go beyond all bearing.\n\nWhile I was bawling out my grief, a man arrived who, having\n\nseen me in my wretchedness, would have avoided my\n\nloathsome company.

      "text": "3 The Fool’s second appearance, in Act I Scene 5 , follows Lear’s humiliation at the hands of Goneril.\n\na Why do you think the Fool’s first joke is about brains?\n\nb What message is he trying to convey in his jokes about crab-apples, noses, and snails?\n\nc Which of the Fool’s remarks is close to the unvarnished truth?\n\nd Mark the text at points where the Fool diverts Lear from brooding about his troubles.\n\n4 a As Lear becomes more isolated and tormented, the Fool works harder to sustain him, maintaining his pointed jokes, puns and witticisms as the King progresses toward madness. In Act II Scene 4\n\ni How many jokes does he make at Lear’s expense?\n\nii How many at Kent’s?\n\niii Is there a significance in the switch of emphasis?\n\nb As Lear departs into the storm, the Fool is his only companion. According to the Gentleman in Act III Scene 1 , what is his function now?\n\n5 The storm scenes ( Act III Scenes 2 ; 4 ; 6 ) are those in which Lear’s “wits begin to turn” and he goes mad.\n\na The Fool suffers from the same physical discomfort as his master. Which lines in Act III Scene 2 show that they have come close together through hardship?\n\nb What incident in Act III Scene 4 is close enough to farce to relieve the dramatic tension?\n\nc Which line spoken by the Fool in Edgar’s presence emphasizes the leveling effect of their situation?\n\nd How does the Fool’s presence at the mock trial of Goneril and Regan help to bring out the full pathos and tragedy of Lear’s condition?\n\n6 The Fool’s last words in the play (“And I’ll go to bed at noon”) can be interpreted many ways. Here are two of them:\n\na “If you are having your evening meal in the morning, then my bedtime will be noon” (i.e., a straightforward quip).\n\nb “I shall not live much longer” (i.e., using the word “bed” as a euphemism for “grave”).\n\nThose who favor (a) point out that the Fool’s dramatic usefulness is at an end, so Shakespeare gives him no more lines to say. Those who favor (b) say Lear’s “And my poor fool is hanged” ( Act V Scene 3 ) proves that he committed suicide, though the word “fool” could mean “child” and therefore refer to Cordelia.\n\nWhat is your opinion?\n\nGloucester\n\n1 Gloucester opens the play by making light of a “pleasant vice” which resulted in the birth of the illegitimate Edmund. Look up Edgar’s words to the dying Edmund in Act V Scene 3 : show how they confirm the former’s belief that “the gods are just” in dealing with immorality.\n\n2 Edmund describes Gloucester as “a credulous father.” Trace the tricks Edmund uses to deceive Gloucester in Act I Scene 1 and Act II Scene 2 .\n\na Is his success due entirely to his manipulative skills, or have recent events made the old Earl vulnerable?\n\nb Show that Gloucester’s mind is in a state of turmoil after Lear’s abdication.\n\n3 Gloucester seems weak, letting others make decisions for him.\n\na To Edmund, he says “frame the business after your own wisdom” in Act I Scene 2 ; and he refers to Cornwall as “The noble Duke my master” in Act II Scene 1 . What is ironic about his dependence on these two men?\n\nb Consider his protest at the stocking of Kent. Do you think he did all he could in the circumstances?\n\nc Read the dialogue between Lear and Gloucester in Act II Scene 4 concerning Cornwall’s slighting of the King. Does Gloucester’s exit line imply that he lacks the courage to take sides?\n\n4 By Act III Scene 2 Gloucester has had further experience of Goneril and Regan, and time to think.\n\na Explain what is praiseworthy about his resolution.\n\nb Explain what is unfortunate about his choice of confidant.\n\nc Explain how he puts his decision to aid Lear into practice.\n\n5 In Act III Scene 7 Gloucester suffers cruelly for his loyalty.\n\na Illustrate\n\ni his dignity while being threatened;\n\nii his strong moral values.\n\nb Later, in Act IV Scene 1 , he says “I stumbled when I saw.” What is the first truth he learns after losing his sight?\n\n6 Blindness brings despair to Gloucester.\n\na In Act IV Scene 1 , which lines sum up his pessimistic philosophy?\n\nb What is his purpose in seeking to be guided toward Dover?\n\n7 Act IV Scene 6 sees Gloucester, led by Edgar, “at the top of that same hill” which, he is told, overlooks the sea.\n\na Explain why it is necessary for Edgar to mislead his father.\n\nb Choose two statements by Gloucester, one after Edgar’s successful ruse, and one after his meeting with Lear, to show that he has rejected the pessimism of Act IV Scene 1 .\n\nc i On what occasion in Act V Scene 2 does Gloucester relapse into melancholy?\n\nii What observation revives him?\n\n8 Gloucester’s death is reported by Edgar in Act V Scene 3 . What was the cause of it?\n\nEdmund\n\n1 We meet Edmund at the very beginning of the play, when Gloucester speaks for him, and we learn of his illegitimacy. Find two reasons why\n\na he might be forgiven for having a jaundiced view of society;\n\nb he might be forgiven for his subsequent lack of filial loyalty.\n\n2 In his soliloquy in Act I Scene 2 , lines 1–22 Edmund speaks for himself.\n\na To whose “law” does he say his “services are bound”?\n\nb List his arguments for appealing to the gods to “stand up for bastards.”\n\n3 a Edmund’s villainy has a strong element of wit about it. Find examples in Act I Scene 2 , with reference to\n\ni his deception of Gloucester and manipulation of Edgar;\n\nii his skeptical references to astrology;\n\niii his use of irony.\n\nb Which lines summarize his case for intrigue against “a credulous father and a brother noble”?\n\nc In Act II Scene 1 ,\n\ni how many examples of his cunning trickery can you find?\n\nii which of Gloucester’s lines indicate that Edmund has succeeded?\n\niii which lines of Cornwall’s advance his prospects even further?\n\n4 In Act III Scene 5 , Edmund tells Cornwall: “I will perserver in my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore between that and my blood.”\n\na Consider\n\ni what he has previously said in Act III Scene 3 ;\n\nii his behavior in Act III Scene 7 ;\n\niii Regan’s report of his murderous intentions in Act IV Scene 5 .\n\nb Is there any evidence of conflicting loyalty?\n\n5 Both Goneril and Regan fall in love with Edmund.\n\na Find the evidence in Act IV Scene 2 , Act IV Scene 5 , and Act V Scene 1 .\n\nb Decide from Edmund’s soliloquy at the end of Act V Scene 1 how far their love is reciprocated.\n\n6 By the end of the play, Edmund has been both victor and vanquished.\n\na In victory, what is his most wicked deed?\n\nb In defeat, what good does he do “despite of mine own nature”?\n\nc Do the words he utters in his dying moments – “Yet Edmund was beloved” – provide any clue about either his past behavior or his deathbed reformation?\n\nEdgar\n\n1 Edgar plays a number of roles throughout the play.\n\na In Act I Scene 1 he is simply the Earl of Gloucester’s legitimate son. How much older is he than Edmund?\n\nb In Act I Scene 2 he is in disgrace. How does Edmund account for the ease with which this was accomplished?\n\nc By Act II Scene 3 he is Poor Tom: “Edgar I nothing am.”\n\ni Describe his appearance.\n\nii Using the information in Act III Scene 4 , list his sufferings and show why “unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal” as he is.\n\niii Explain why Lear finds him a congenial companion, and how Lear’s suffering helps Edgar endure his own.\n\niv Show from Edgar’s words in Act IV Scene 1 that he has the courage and the philosophy to overcome despair.\n\n2 a Edgar is changed for the better when he appears in Act IV Scene 6 , although he denies this to his blind father.\n\ni From whom did he obtain his superior clothes?\n\nii In what ways is his speech different?\n\nb i What is Edgar’s purpose in “trifling thus with his [i.e., Gloucester’s] despair”?\n\nii Explain his method of procedure.\n\nc Which lines of Gloucester’s prove that the ruse has worked?\n\n3 a In his final role in the play, Edgar is a man of action.\n\ni What is his first valorous deed on behalf of his father in Act IV Scene 6 ?\n\nii What is the second, before the battle, in Act V Scene 1 ?\n\niii What is the third, after the battle?\n\nb i Show from the speeches of Edmund and Albany at the end of the play that Edgar has royal dignity.\n\nii In the Quarto edition of the play (1608), the last lines of King Lear are given to Albany. Do you agree with the Folio editors that the words are more appropriately given to Edgar?\n\nStructure, themes and imagery\n\n1 The play has both a main plot and a subplot. Identify the main characters in each.\n\n2 Show how in each there is\n \n3 Complete the following:\n \n4 The theme that initiates events in the play is that of the generation gap; the relationship of parent and child, and the duties and obligations that flow from the blood-bond. Find examples of parent/child relationships involving\n\n(a) gratitude/ingratitude (b) kindness/cruelty (c) trust/deceit (d) legitimacy/illegitimacy (e) duties/freedoms (f) respect/contempt (g) hatred/love\n\n5 Self-knowledge, and the pursuit of truth, go hand-in-hand with the development of the plot.\n\na Lear goes mad before he comes to his senses. Find examples of his progress from folly to wisdom in the following scenes:\n\n(i) Act I Scene 1 (ii) Act I Scene 4 (iii) Act 2 Scene 4 (iv) Act 3 Scenes 2  and  6 (v) Act 4 Scenes 6  and  7\n\nb Gloucester loses his sight before he can “see.” Trace the stages through which he passes (noting in particular how he learns to accept Edgar’s dictum “Ripeness is all”) in the following scenes:\n\n(i) Act I Scenes 1  and  2 (ii) Act 2 Scene 1 (iii) Act 3 Scenes 3  and  4 (iv) Act 3 Scene 7 (v) Act 4 Scene 1 (vi) Act 4 Scene 6 (vii) Act 5 Scene 2 .\n\n6 a The largest theme of all is that of the nature of man, in terms both of the individual and of the way he behaves (often hypocritically) in organized society. The following speeches are central; they are all spoken by Lear:\n\ni “Reason not the need …” ( Act 2 Scene 4 ). What is “the need”?\n\nii “Let the great gods … find out their enemies now” ( Act 3 Scene 2 ). Who are their enemies?\n\niii “Poor naked wretches …” ( Act 3 Scene 4 ). What is to be learned from them?\n\niv “What, art mad? … harder, harder; so.” ( Act 4 Scene 6 ) What has Lear learned about power, corruption, and the dispensation of justice?\n\nb How many relevant pieces of wisdom can you find among the songs and sayings of the Fool?\n\n7 Animal imagery abounds in King Lear. To convey the inhumanity of human behavior and its similarity to wild life, over sixty different creatures are mentioned. Trace the following to their sources, and explain their significance in the context of the play:\n\n(a) “monster ingratitude” (b) “serpent’s tooth” (c) “wolvish visage” (d) “like a vulture” (e) “most serpent-like” (f) “like rats … like dogs” (g) “those pelican daughters” (h) “rash boarish fangs” (i) “Tigers, not daughters” (j) “be-monster not thy feature” (k) “dog-hearted daughters”.\n\nHow many more can you find?\n\n8 a Look up Gloucester’s speech in Act I Scene 2 : “These late eclipses in the sun and moon….” How many words can you find that imply discord, social breakdown, and fractured relationships?\n\nb “Division” is echoed in figurative expressions throughout the play. Place the following examples in context and explain the force of the imagery:\n\ni “These hot tears which break from me perforce …” ( Act 1 )\n\nii “Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain …” ( Act 2 )\n\niii “Crack Nature’s moulds …” ( Act 3 )\n\niv “She that herself will silver and disbranch from her material sap …” ( Act 4 )\n\nv “The strings of life begin to crack …” ( Act 5 )\n\n9 Imagery based on physical suffering is recurrent in King Lear. The torment endured by Lear and Gloucester, and the savagery of the play as a whole, are reflected in terms of “a human body in anguished movement: tugged, wrenched, beaten, pierced, stung, scourged, dislocated, flayed, gashed, scalded, tortured and finally broken on the rack” (Caroline Spurgeon: Shakespeare’s Imagery).\n\na Trace the following examples to their contexts, and explain their appositeness. They are all from Act One .\n\ni … “wrenched my frame of nature from the fixed place”\n\nii … “Th’untented woundings of a father’s curse Pierce every sense about thee!”\n\niii … “with her nails she’ll flay thy wolvish visage”\n\nb Find further examples, guided by Miss Spurgeon’s list.\n\n10 In his opening address to the court in Act I Scene 1 , Lear says he will “divest” himself of “rule, Interest of territory, cares of state.” Imagery based on clothing (or references to it) can be found throughout the play.\n\na Find examples from speeches by the following:\n\ni France, in Act I Scene 1 ;\n\nii Cornwall, in Act 2 Scene 2 ;\n\niii Lear, in Act 3 Scene 4 ;\n\niv Lear in Act 3 Scene 6 .\n\nb Explain why clothes have a symbolic significance in relation to the play’s major themes.\n\nTextual questions\n\nRead the original Shakespeare and (if necessary) the modern transcription, to gain an understanding of the speeches and extracts below. Then concentrate entirely on the original in answering the questions.\n\n1 Thou, Nature, art my goddess ( Act I Scene 2 )\n\na Edmund has said very little up to this point, and what he has said would accord with customs in polite society. What is the element of shock built into these first words of his soliloquy?\n\nb A soliloquy can either be regarded as “thinking aloud, alone” or “confiding inner thoughts to a wider audience.” If you were playing the part of Edmund, would you treat these lines as private musing, or as an opportunity to address the audience?\n\nc Why is custom said to be “a plague”?\n\nd Why is “moonshines Lag of a brother” more wittily suggestive than “younger than a brother”?\n\ne Edmund repeats “base” five times, “bastard” three times, and “bastardy” and “baseness” once each, all in the space of twenty-two lines. What effect does this have on what in former times would have been a series of words with derogatory connotations?\n\nf What effect on the meaning of “legitimate” does Edmund’s\n\n(i) reference to conception in and out of wedlock and\n\n(ii) repetition of the word as adjective and noun five times have on its normally favorable meaning?\n\ng Why might an audience at this stage in the play’s development side with a character who has announced his villainous intentions?\n\n2 These late eclipses in the sun and moon ( Act I Scene 2 )\n\na Gloucester believes there is an astrological explanation for the troubles of his time. What is Edmund’s viewpoint on the subject?\n\nb “Nature” is a word frequently used throughout the play; here it means “man’s reason.” Collect as many references to nature as you can find, and interpret each one according to the context in which it appears.\n\nc Several items in Gloucester’s catalogue of woe are directly related to the circumstances of the play. Explain each.\n\nd Gloucester uses the word “nothing.” So do Lear and Cordelia in Act I Scene 1 . (i) How many times can you find the word employed in King Lear and (ii) can you explain why it should be so significant a word?\n\n3 I heard myself proclaimed ( Act 2 Scene 3 )\n\na Why “happy” hollow?\n\nb Edgar uses mostly words of one or two syllables in this soliloquy. (i) How does this help to emphasize important information and (ii) how does this help to emphasize the words which are exceptions to the rule?\n\nc Edgar is planning to be “Poor Tom” here. Compare what is said of him, and by him, in Act 3 Scene 4 . Does he carry out his plans to the letter?\n\nd The play is set in ancient Britain: what evidence is there here that Elizabethan audiences did not object to anachronisms?\n\ne Reread Act I Scene 2 : what is ironic about Edgar’s choice of name for his new identity?\n\n4 I prithee, daughter , do not make me mad ( Act 2 Scene 4 )\n\na In this speech, Lear says “I can be patient.” “Patient” and “patience” are words with many echoes throughout the play. Find as many as you can.\n\nb Here patience is shown in the way Lear’s outbursts are followed by checks. Mark the text (i) where you believe Lear raises his voice in anger, and (ii) where he disciplines himself with self-control.\n\nc (i) Some lines are effective here because they are antithetical: that is, one half of the line is balanced against the other. Find examples, and say how they add to the pathos of Lear’s words.\n\n(ii) Sometimes Lear’s mounting anger results in repetition in sets of three words or phrases. Find two examples.\n\nd How does Lear make his critical points perfectly clear while affecting not to?\n\n5 O, reason not the need ( Act 2 Scene 4 )\n\na The first lines relate significantly to the process whereby Lear’s folly is redeemed. Explain why.\n\nb Lear only once refers to “God” in his speeches. Here, as elsewhere, he addresses “heavens” and “you gods.” Sometimes in the play the gods are regarded as malevolent (find Gloucester’s anguished cry in Act 4 Scene 1 ) and sometimes benign (note his retraction in Act 4 Scene 6 ). What position does Lear take here?\n\nc How is Lear’s pathetic impotence conveyed (i) in disjointed sentences and (ii) by a short line?\n\nd If you were producing the play, would you have Lear leave the stage in tears, or not? Discuss the alternatives and give reasons for your decision.\n\n6 Blow , winds , and crack your cheeks! ( Act 3 Scene 2 )\n\na The Elizabethan theater had primitive sound effects, and performances took place on fine days in the open air. How does Shakespeare\n\ni create the illusion of a storm by means of words?\n\nii succeed in conveying a sense of Lear’s impending mental breakdown?\n\nb The passionate force of Lear’s raging is conveyed by the verbs he uses to command the elements.\n\ni List them, and\n\nii show how water, fire, explosion and destruction are called upon to carry out his orders.\n\nc In this speech, some lines are composed of multisyllabic and/or hyphenated words; others are mainly monosyllabic.\n\ni List them, and\n\nii show how water, fire, explosion and destruction are called upon to carry out his orders.\n\n7 Examine the following key speeches in similar detail:\n\na Poor naked wretches, whereso’er you are ( Act 3 Scene 4 )\n\nb Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile ( Act 4 Scene 2 )\n\nc Come on, sir, here’s the place: stand still ( Act 4 Scene 6 )\n\nd Ay, every inch a king ( Act 4 Scene 6 )\n\ne And the creature run from the cur ( Act 4 Scene 6 )\n\nf Pray do not mock me ( Act 4 Scene 7 )\n\ng No, no, no, no!

      "profile": "Albany is a nobleman of Britain in William Shakespeare's *King Lear* and the husband of Goneril, Lear’s ruthless eldest daughter. While he initially appears as a passive and somewhat overshadowed figure in the turbulent world of the play, Albany evolves into one of its moral anchors, demonstrating integrity, compassion, and a strong sense of justice. His character offers a counterpoint to the unchecked ambition and cruelty seen in others, particularly his wife.  \n\nPhysically, while the text provides no explicit description, Albany's demeanor and dialogue suggest a steady, grounded presence. He is a man of principled restraint, often choosing careful reflection over rash action. His initial passivity, however, leaves him vulnerable to manipulation by Goneril, whose ambitions far exceed her loyalty to him. Their marriage quickly dissolves into a toxic web of mistrust and antipathy, as Albany perceives—and eventually condemns—her ruthless betrayal of her father, King Lear.  \n\nAlbany’s personality is defined by his slow but steady transformation from a hesitant observer to an assertive moral force. Early in the play, he is portrayed as kind-hearted but indecisive, unwilling to directly oppose Goneril’s plots despite his evident discomfort. However, as the chaos in Lear’s kingdom escalates, Albany undergoes significant growth. Spurred by his outrage at Goneril's cruelty and the injustices inflicted upon Lear and Cordelia, he finds his voice and stands against tyranny and moral corruption.  \n\nAlbany plays a crucial role in the resolution of the play's conflicts. He allies himself with Edgar and leads his forces against the invading French army commanded by Cordelia and Lear, though his ultimate loyalty lies not with conquest but with restoring order to the realm. After the battle, Albany reveals his strength of character by seeking justice for the conspiracy between Goneril and Edmund, her lover. He exposes their treachery, paving the way for Edgar to confront Edmund and for Goneril's schemes to unravel disastrously.  \n\nA figure of quiet integrity, Albany survives the play’s tragic trajectory. By the end, he emerges as one of the few characters left standing, tasked with the immense burden of leading the fractured kingdom after Lear’s death. His final gesture, offering shared rule to Kent and Edgar, underscores his humility and desire for collaborative governance. Ultimately, Albany’s arc is that of a reluctant leader who rises to the occasion, proving that moral conviction, even when delayed, can prevail where ambition and cruelty falter."

      "profile": "Cordelia is the youngest and most virtuous of King Lear's three daughters in Shakespeare's tragic play \"King Lear.\" Renowned for her honesty and integrity, she is a beacon of truth and loyalty amidst a landscape riddled with duplicity and betrayal. Unlike her elder sisters, Goneril and Regan, who flatter Lear with exaggerated declarations of love to gain inheritance, Cordelia remains steadfast in her sincerity. Her refusal to engage in hollow flattery leads to her disinheritance as Lear, blinded by vanity and pride, misinterprets her answer as a lack of affection.\n\nDespite being cast aside, Cordelia's moral fortitude ensures she finds favor with the King of France, who esteems her virtues above material wealth. This union bolsters her position and provides her a platform from which she later returns to England to help her beleaguered father. Cordelia is often described as possessing a humble and gentle demeanor, with her presence exuding a natural grace that commands respect.\n\nCordelia's core motivation is rooted in her unwavering love and duty towards her father, King Lear. Even after being wronged, she continues to care for him, demonstrating her deep compassion and strength of character. Her primary aim remains to protect and restore Lear amidst the tumultuous chaos unleashed by Goneril and Regan's schemes.\n\nHer relationships are deeply intertwined with the play's central conflict. She shares an estranged yet passionate bond with Lear, and her fairness starkly contrasts with the evil machinations of her sisters. In her dealings with France, Cordelia remains noble and earnest, a stark counterpoint to the self-serving relationships seen elsewhere in the narrative.\n\nThroughout the play, Cordelia endures significant trials, from being disowned to facing the capture and ensuing peril in Edmund's treacherous machinations. Despite these adversities, her resilience and grace remain unmarred. As the narrative progresses, she emerges as a symbol of hope and redemption, embodying an ideal that contrasts sharply with the play's darker elements.\n\nIn the climax, captured alongside her father, Cordelia confronts her fate with dignity and fortitude. Her attempt to stand resolute against Edmund's tyranny highlights her enduring courage and devotion. Tragically, despite her noble intentions and unwavering love, her efforts culminate in her death, a poignant reminder of the senseless cruelty and injustice pervading the world around her.\n\nCordelia's character arc portrays a profound journey from an earnest, disinherited daughter standing up for truth to a symbol of sacrifice and integrity. Her tragic end only underscores the senseless tragedy that engulfs the kingdom, further solidifying her role as a moral compass in the unraveling story of \"King Lear.\""

      "profile": "The Duke of Albany, one of the figures navigating the turbulent tides of Shakespeare's *King Lear*, stands as a complicated but ultimately redeemable character within a realm rife with treachery and discord. As the husband of Goneril, Lear's eldest and most ruthless daughter, Albany begins the play as a seemingly passive and ineffectual nobleman, overshadowed by the cunning and ambition of his wife. Though he is tied by marriage to Goneril's malice and schemes, Albany's progression throughout the play demonstrates a growing moral clarity and a willingness to defy tyranny.\n\nPhysically, Shakespeare provides little description of Albany’s appearance, leaving the focus on his internal qualities and development. Initially, Albany's demeanor is marked by reluctance to challenge his wife’s cruelty, appearing indecisive or complacent. He fails to intervene as Goneril and her sister Regan conspire against their father, King Lear, and abuse their newly gained power. Albany’s silence and inaction at the start cast him as complicit, even if not directly malevolent.\n\nAs the story progresses, Albany's inherent goodness and honor begin to surface, spurred by his growing awareness of the injustices around him. His moral conscience is ignited when he sees firsthand the devastating effects of Goneril and Regan’s cold-hearted schemes. Unlike his wife, Albany feels a deep sense of loyalty to the natural order and to Lear as king and father. He condemns Goneril's betrayal of Lear and begins to distance himself from her villainous actions. This moral awakening marks a turning point for Albany, one in which he transitions from a passive observer to an active participant in the play's events.\n\nAlbany’s most significant relationships—those with Goneril and Lear—highlight his role as a character striving for redemption. His marriage to Goneril deteriorates as her cruelty escalates, ultimately culminating in her infidelity and plans to murder him in favor of her lover, Edmund. Albany, however, retains a measure of dignity and strength, refusing to sink to her level. His relationship with Lear underscores Albany’s eventual transformation; though initially failing to protect the king, Albany emerges by the play’s conclusion as a figure advocating justice and attempting to restore order to the fractured kingdom.\n\nKey decisions and actions showcase Albany’s growth. His decisive confrontation with Goneril and Edmund in the final acts signals his complete rejection of their treachery. Aligning himself with the forces loyal to Lear and Cordelia, Albany asserts himself as a champion of righteousness and the rightful social hierarchy, striving to undo the chaos wrought by his wife and her allies. Notably, he assumes a leadership role in the aftermath of the climactic battles, displaying both humility and a sense of responsibility as the kingdom lies in ruins.\n\nAlbany’s character arc is defined by his slow yet steady awakening to his own moral convictions. From a man hesitant to act in the face of wrongdoing, he evolves into a voice of reason and justice, bringing some measure of hope to a bleak and tragic narrative. His ultimate rejection of Goneril’s evil solidifies Albany as a figure of integrity, albeit one whose early inaction contributed to the suffering he later seeks to amend.\n\nIn the grim world of *King Lear*, where morality is often overshadowed by ambition and betrayal, the Duke of Albany provides a rare glimpse of redemption and personal growth, making him an understated yet crucial presence in the tragedy’s unfolding."

      "profile": "The Duke of Burgundy, a minor but pivotal character in William Shakespeare's \"King Lear,\" is initially presented as a suitor to King Lear's youngest and most virtuous daughter, Cordelia. Burgundy stands as a symbol of materialism and opportunism, embodying the qualities of a nobleman more concerned with wealth and status than genuine affection or moral integrity.\n\nPhysically, Burgundy is likely envisioned as a typical nobleman of the Elizabethan era, adorned with the regalia befitting his rank, reflecting his status and the societal values he upholds. His motivations are made starkly clear through his interactions with Lear and Cordelia. Burgundy's desire for a beneficial marriage is driven by the prospects of material gain and influence, showcasing a personality that places financial security above emotional or ethical considerations.\n\nBurgundy's rejection of Cordelia after her disinheritance by Lear underscores his primary objective: a dowry. This decision marks a crucial juncture early in the play; it not only illustrates Burgundy's character but also accentuates Cordelia's purity and virtue, when juxtaposed with King of France, who chooses to marry her regardless of her newfound poverty. This contrast further isolates Burgundy as a character for whom love is secondary to economic advantage, making him a foil to France’s nobler disposition.\n\nDespite his limited presence in the play, Burgundy's decision not to marry Cordelia is significant, as it sets into motion the series of events leading to Cordelia's alliance with France. His actions mirror a central theme of \"King Lear\": the moral decay and transactional nature of relationships within the aristocracy.\n\nUltimately, Burgundy’s character does not undergo significant development throughout the play, as his swift exit follows his rejection of Cordelia, leaving him largely unchanged by the narrative's end. Yet, his refusal serves as a catalyst that underscores the complexities of love, loyalty, and ambition—key elements around which the tragedy unfolds. Burgundy remains an embodiment of a pragmatic but morally lacking world, where human affection is oftentimes forfeited for the allure of wealth."

      "profile": "The Duke of Cornwall emerges as a formidable presence in Shakespeare’s \"King Lear,\" navigating the treacherous waters of political ambition alongside his wife, Regan. As a key player in the disintegration of Lear's kingdom, Cornwall is characterized by a ruthless drive for power, often displaying cunning and manipulation to achieve his desires.\n\nIn terms of background, Cornwall is aligned with one of the three factions vying for control after King Lear's decision to divide the realm. He is married to Regan, Lear's second daughter, forming a power couple marked by a shared ambition and treachery. This relationship is central to his role in the play, as both spouses are united in their pursuit of authority, often employing deceitful tactics to undermine those in their path.\n\nPhysically, Cornwall is not described in explicit detail by Shakespeare, yet his actions paint the picture of a man who commands respect, if not fear, from those around him. His presence is intimidating, and he exercises his authority with a confident, almost tyrannical air.\n\nCornwall's personality is marked by a mix of political shrewdness and brutal determination. He is calculating, politically astute, and unafraid to resort to violence to secure his objectives. This is evident in his cruel treatment of Gloucester, whom he blinds, thus demonstrating his own descent into moral darkness driven by the lust for command.\n\nMotivated primarily by the lure of power, Cornwall aligns himself with individuals who can further his and Regan's schemes. He perceives Edmund, the illegitimate son of Gloucester, as a useful ally due to Edmund's apparent loyalty and willingness to betray his own family for personal gain. Cornwall's ability to recognize and exploit the ambitions of others forms a crucial part of his strategy in consolidating power.\n\nThroughout the play, Cornwall's notable actions include his participation in the humiliation and overthrow of King Lear, his tactical alliances with figures like Edmund, and his merciless assault on Gloucester. These actions illustrate his descent into a morally bankrupt quest for dominance, devoid of empathy or familial loyalty.\n\nCornwall’s relationships are defined by manipulation and exploitation. He and Regan form a united front, yet his trust in and reliance on Edmund, propelled by Edmund’s deceit, showcase Cornwall's vulnerability and ultimate downfall. This misplaced trust leads to his involvement in the treachery against Gloucester, an act that seals his fate.\n\nAs the play progresses, Cornwall’s character arc does not herald redemption but rather culminates in retributive justice. His brutal blinding of Gloucester incites outrage and ultimately leads to Cornwall’s own death at the hands of a loyal servant of Gloucester, serving as a grim testament to the chaos he helped sow.\n\nIn summary, the Duke of Cornwall is a dark, complex character whose contributions to the narrative of \"King Lear\" underscore themes of betrayal, ambition, and the moral consequences of unchecked power. His calculated rise is matched only by his violent fall, rendering him an integral force in the tragedy that unfolds."

      "profile": "The Earl of Gloucester is a nobleman embroiled in the tragic tapestry of William Shakespeare's \"King Lear.\" As a devoted subject of King Lear, Gloucester is both loyal and well-meaning but plagued by a tragic naivety that leads to his downfall. Physically, he is described in the play as an older man, highlighting his age and diminished physical capabilities after enduring significant mistreatment. Despite this, his status and bearing as a nobleman remain prominent throughout the narrative.\n\nAt the story's onset, Gloucester is depicted as a father to two sons: the legitimate Edgar and the illegitimate Edmund. His love for both is genuine but marred by misplaced trust. Motivated by a desire to maintain familial cohesion and secure his legacy, Gloucester becomes a pawn in Edmund's machinations. Edmund harbors resentment over his illegitimacy and crafts an elaborate ruse that convinces Gloucester of Edgar's supposed betrayal. Gloucester's susceptibility to celestial omens and Edmund’s cunning adds layers to his vulnerability, leading him to disown Edgar and favor the conniving Edmund.\n\nA core part of Gloucester's character arc involves his tragic betrayal by Edmund. Under the pretext of a forged letter and other deceitful plots, Edmund meticulously manipulates Gloucester into believing Edgar plots to usurp him. This manipulation drives Gloucester to align further with figures like Cornwall and Regan, unaware of Edmund’s deeper ambition. Amidst this, Gloucester remains loyally aligned with Lear, deciding to aid him secretly as the political landscape grows turbulent, an act that underscores his enduring sense of duty even when overshadowed by personal betrayals.\n\nThe narrative journey of Gloucester takes a devastating turn when he is blinded by Regan and Cornwall for aiding Lear. This physical blindness serves as a metaphor for Gloucester’s earlier inability to see through Edmund's lies. Subsequently, Gloucester, overwhelmed by despair and guilt, contemplates suicide. In a poignant moment, Edgar, disguised as a peasant, leads him to a cliff, intending to save him by fabricating a miraculous survival story. This emotional deception serves as a turning point for Gloucester, leading him to a renewed sense of life and acceptance of suffering, albeit with a fragile hold on hope.\n\nThroughout King Lear, Gloucester's relationships with his sons are a focal point. His misguided trust in Edmund juxtaposes his estrangement from Edgar, painting a portrait of familial distortion. Ultimately, Gloucester’s character reflects themes of betrayal, redemption, and the peril of misplaced allegiance, embodying the human struggle against deception and the search for truth within the chaos. His experience, brimming with suffering, re-aligns as Edgar provides guidance and support, culminating in Gloucester's reluctant acceptance of life’s hardships and mortality.\n\nIn summary, the Earl of Gloucester is a tragic figure whose journey reflects broader themes within \"King Lear.\" His narrative arc from trust and betrayal to suffering and reconciliation underscores the complexities of human relationships and the enduring quest for truth amidst treachery."

      "profile": "**Name**: Edmund  \n**Work**: *King Lear* by William Shakespeare  \n\n**Background**: Edmund, the illegitimate younger son of the Earl of Gloucester, is a deeply ambitious and cunning figure who resents his lower social standing due to his illegitimacy. Throughout *King Lear*, he schemes to supplant his legitimate half-brother, Edgar, as their father’s heir and to secure power and recognition for himself. This personal vendetta against the societal constraints of illegitimacy fuels his deceitful actions.  \n\n**Physical Description**: While Shakespeare’s text does not provide a detailed description of Edmund's physical appearance, his charisma, confidence, and sharp wit suggest an air of attractiveness and poise that allows him to manipulate others with ease.  \n\n**Personality Traits and Core Motivations**:  \nEdmund is intelligent, calculating, and charismatic, capable of masking his malice beneath a façade of loyalty, sincerity, and filial devotion. He harbors deep resentment toward the societal stigmas attached to his birth, which fuels his desire to overturn this perceived injustice by any means necessary. Cynical and opportunistic, he rejects traditional values of loyalty and honor, focusing instead on self-interest and pragmatism. His ultimate goal is to advance his position, regardless of whom he must betray or harm to do so.  \n\n**Notable Attributes**:  \n- **Cunning Manipulation**: Edmund is a master strategist, skilled at exploiting the weaknesses and gullibility of others—most notably his father, Gloucester, and his brother, Edgar.  \n- **Rhetorical Skill**: His ability to craft persuasive lies and manipulate conversations makes him a formidable antagonist.  \n- **Ambitious Pragmatism**: Unlike other characters driven by emotion or loyalty, Edmund is dispassionately pragmatic, viewing people as tools to achieve his goals.  \n\n**Key Relationships**:  \n- **Gloucester (Father)**: Edmund manipulates his gullible father, capitalizing on Gloucester’s superstition and quick temper to convince him of Edgar's alleged treachery.  \n- **Edgar (Half-Brother)**: He betrays Edgar by fabricating evidence of his supposed plot against Gloucester, forcing Edgar to flee and live in hiding as a fugitive.  \n- **Goneril and Regan**: Edmund becomes entangled in a love triangle with the two ambitious sisters, manipulating their affection and rivalry to consolidate his political influence.  \n- **King Lear and Cordelia**: In the play’s climax, Edmund seals King Lear and Cordelia’s doom by ordering their execution, showcasing his ruthless determination to eliminate obstacles to his authority.  \n\n**Major Plot Involvement**:  \n- **Framing Edgar**: Edmund orchestrates his scheme by forging a letter that implicates Edgar in a treasonous plot against Gloucester. He then persuades both Edgar and Gloucester of the other's supposed hostility, ultimately driving Edgar into exile and securing Gloucester’s trust for himself.  \n- **Betraying Gloucester**: When Gloucester seeks to aid the ousted King Lear, Edmund betrays his father's plan to Regan and Cornwall, leading to Gloucester’s capture and eventual torture.  \n- **Manipulating Goneril and Regan**: Edmund cunningly exploits the sisters’ infatuation with him to secure political alliances, sow discord between them, and further his own ambitions.  \n- **Lear and Cordelia’s Fate**: After capturing Lear and Cordelia following a battle, he orders their execution, proving his cruelty and willingness to eliminate any threats to his authority.  \n\n**Key Decisions and Actions**:  \n- Forging a letter to frame Edgar as a conspirator.  \n- Staging a fake fight with Edgar to “prove” his brother’s guilt and gain Gloucester’s favor.  \n- Betraying Gloucester to Cornwall, showcasing his capacity for patricide through indirect action.  \n- Capitalizing on Goneril and Regan’s obsession with him to manipulate the power dynamics between them.  \n- Attempting to solidify his control by ordering Cordelia’s murder, even despite her helpless position.  \n\n**Character Development**:  \nThroughout *King Lear*, Edmund emerges as one of the most unrepentant and ruthless figures, driven solely by self-interest. However, in his final moments, his character takes an intriguing turn. After being mortally wounded in a duel by his brother Edgar, Edmund shows the slightest hint of redemption, attempting to reverse Cordelia's execution order. Despite this fleeting gesture, it comes too late to redeem the trail of destruction he has left in his wake.  \n\n**Significance**:  \nEdmund represents the nihilistic rejection of social and familial bonds in favor of self-serving ambition, embodying the play’s thematic exploration of betrayal, greed, and the corrupting effects of power. His actions set in motion much of the tragedy’s chaos, underscoring the fragility of trust and the devastating consequences of unchecked ambition.  \n\n**Legacy**:  \nWith his death, Edmund’s schemes unravel, and order is partially restored, though the scars of his treachery linger. His character remains one of Shakespeare's most complex villains—a figure whose intelligence and charisma make him as compelling as he is morally reprehensible."

      "profile": "**Name:** Fool\n\n**Background and Description:**  \nIn William Shakespeare's \"King Lear,\" the Fool serves as King Lear’s loyal jester, characterized by his astute wit and incisive humor. His role transcends the typical function of a jester, as he bravely speaks truths veiled in jest, undeterred by the king's volatile state. He appears as a seemingly irreverent figure, yet his intentions are rooted in loyalty and compassion, aiming to guide Lear through the tumultuous landscape of his personal and political collapse.\n\n**Physical Description:**  \nShakespeare does not provide a detailed physical description of the Fool. The traditional image portrays him in motley clothing suitable for a jester, perhaps adorned with cap and bells, symbolizing his profession as a truth-teller cloaked in folly.\n\n**Personality Traits and Core Motivations:**  \nThe Fool is witty, perceptive, and courageous. Despite his humorous demeanor, he is driven by a deep concern for Lear’s well-being. His unrelenting honesty and dedication to revealing harsh truths demonstrate that his primary motivation is to protect Lear from complete madness and help him recognize the consequences of his actions, such as wrongly trusting his daughters, Goneril and Regan, and dismissing his loyal daughter, Cordelia.\n\n**Notable Attributes:**  \nAs both a comic and tragic presence, the Fool possesses a sharp intellect and uses humor as his tool for delivering insight. His jibes are prophetic, often illustrating the folly of Lear’s decisions and the inevitable outcomes of his actions. He deftly navigates the court's tension-filled atmosphere, offering levity while simultaneously unveiling deeper insights into human nature and power dynamics.\n\n**Relationships:**  \nThe Fool shares a complex and affectionate bond with King Lear, acting as a companion and confidant who can chastise the king with relative impunity due to his protective role and Lear's affections. He also interacts with other core characters, albeit indirectly, influencing their perceptions of Lear and the unfolding chaos.\n\n**Key Experiences and Plot Involvement:**  \nThe Fool remains steadfastly by Lear’s side during the king’s descent into madness, as depicted in key scenes such as the raging storm on the heath. His efforts are directed at reminding Lear of his past errors, especially focusing on his decision to divide the kingdom. The Fool's clever commentary on Goneril’s harshness and Regan’s treachery provides insightful reflections on the disintegration of familial loyalty. He also addresses Lear’s loss of authority and sanity, guiding him with wit-coated truths throughout the narrative.\n\n**Character Arc and Development:**  \nThough the Fool does not undergo a significant personal transformation, his presence serves as a constant in Lear's whirlwind of instability and confusion. He remains committed to his role until his departure from the play, leaving an undeniable impact through his wisdom and the heartfelt truth cloaked in folly. The Fool's absence after Act 3 heightens the tragedy of Lear's subsequent decisions, reinforcing the Fool’s silent yet profound influence during his presence.\n\nIn summary, the Fool stands as a beacon of clarity within the chaos of \"King Lear.\" Through humor and unwavering loyalty, he strives to prevent Lear’s complete undoing, leaving an indelible mark on the play’s profound exploration of trust, betrayal, and the human condition."

      "profile": "Goneril, the eldest daughter of King Lear, emerges as a paramount figure in Shakespeare's tragedy, \"King Lear\". Married to the Duke of Albany, she is characterized by her ambition, duplicity, and a relentless hunger for power. Her physical appearance, as described through Shakespeare's language, is less emphasized, placing greater significance on her dominating presence and influential role within the narrative.\n\nRaised in a royal household, the expectations of loyalty and subservience to her father have shaped Goneril's early years. However, her underlying motivations paint a portrait of a woman driven by the desire to usurp control and command authority. Goneril's defining moment occurs during Lear's test of affection when she deceitfully professes boundless love for her father, stating, \"I love you more than words can wield the matter; dearer than eyesight, space and liberty.\" Yet behind this façade lies a calculated scheme to secure the largest portion of Lear's kingdom.\n\nHer relationships are fraught with tension and manipulation. With her sister Regan, Goneril shares an initial alliance, both intent on undermining Lear. However, this alliance crumbles in the face of jealousy and rivalry for the affections of Edmund, showcasing Goneril's willingness to go to any lengths to achieve her aims. Her relationship with her husband, Albany, is equally complex; she often belittles him, underscoring her contempt for his moral compass and perceived weakness.\n\nGoneril's narrative arc follows her rise and fall as she plots against Lear, progressively stripping away his knights and refusing his demands, which exemplifies her usurpation of power. Her decision to deny Lear his retinue and subsequent cold-hearted instruction to treat him with disdain mirrors her growing dominance. Her confrontation with Lear in her palace reflects her escalating control over her father, challenging his sovereignty and reshaping the familial dynamics.\n\nAs the plot thickens, Goneril's Machiavellian tactics further embroil her in a struggle for dominance, notably with Regan, as both vie for Edmund's allegiance. This rivalry culminates in a deadly scheme that backfires, reflecting the destructive potential of unchecked ambition. Ultimately, Goneril's character arc closes in tragedy, as her manipulations lead not to glory but to downfall and despair.\n\nGoneril's significance to \"King Lear\" lies in her embodiment of ambition and treachery, serving as a catalyst for the play's exploration of power, betrayal, and the corrosive nature of unchecked desires. Her narrative underscores the essential themes of familial discord and the tragic consequences of forsaking loyalty and integrity for authority."

This act of devotion and integrity sets the stage for a journey defined by service and resilience.\n\nKent's physical description is largely absent from the text, yet his actions paint him as a man of strong, principled stature. He is bold enough to confront the king directly, displaying an intuitive understanding of justice and loyalty that underscore his dedication. Banishment does not deter Kent; instead, it reinforces his motivation to serve Lear, adopting the disguise of a commoner named Caius to remain close to the king.\n\nKent's personality is defined by his unwavering sense of duty, blunt honesty, and pragmatic wisdom. He is selfless, a quality illustrated by his acceptance of hardship to protect and serve Lear. Whether enduring the humiliation of the stocks or facing the raging elements of the storm alongside Lear, Kent embodies steadfast loyalty and unyielding support, a pillar of strength against the chaos that ensues.\n\nThe core of Kent's relationships revolves around his connection to Lear. Despite Lear's grave mistakes and tragic descent into madness, Kent remains a constant ally, advocating for Lear even when the king's faculties desert him. His interactions with the Fool and Edgar, in their respective roles of truth-teller and silent watcher, highlight a sensitive understanding of the human condition amidst turmoil and betrayal.\n\nThroughout the play, Kent's significant experiences include his stand against Lear's harshness toward Cordelia, his humble aid in the storm when Lear’s daughters plot against their father, and his endurance of public shame. These moments are pivotal in shaping his identity as the moral compass of the narrative and showcase his loyalty as both personal choice and destiny.\n\nKent's key decisions are marked by his choice to remain in England under disguise, risking his safety to support Lear, proving that integrity guides his actions beyond personal interest. This decision reflects his primary motivation: ensuring Lear's well-being, a mission that transcends the tumultuous fall of kingly authority.\n\nKent experiences minimal arc or development in terms of changing beliefs or persona, which remains steadfast throughout. His journey is one of continued devotion and moral fortitude, arguably evolving into one of the tragedy's most enduring symbols of loyalty and honor in a world rife with treachery and betrayal. In the end, Kent remains with Lear until the very end, his faithfulness underscoring the depths of the human spirit when confronted with the bleakest challenges."

      "profile": "**King Lear** is a central figure in William Shakespeare’s tragedy *\"King Lear\"*, embodying the complexities of human frailty and the catastrophic consequences of pride and misjudgment. Once the imperious and seemingly omnipotent King of Britain, Lear's story is one of profound transformation, marked by an acute fall from power, sanity, and familial connection.\n\n**Background and Physical Description:** Lear is portrayed as an elderly monarch whose reign has spanned a significant period, yet he bears little patience for the burdens of rule as he grows older. Physically, Lear is beyond his prime, a presence once regal but now increasingly vulnerable, a testament to the toll of age and the emotional upheaval he experiences throughout the narrative.\n\n**Personality Traits and Core Motivations:** Lear is characterized by his impulsive nature and deep-seated desire for validation. He thrives on flattery, which fuels his vanity, blinding him to truth and sincerity. This yearning for affirmation leads him to test his daughters' love by demanding public declarations of affection in return for portions of his kingdom. Lear’s decision is driven by the hope of ensuring his legacy while retaining power without the responsibility of rulership.\n\n**Notable Attributes and Major Plot Involvement:** Lear's story is driven by his tragic flaws—pride, blindness to truth, and a descent into madness. The decision to divide his kingdom based on superficial flattery leads to a cascade of betrayals, as his elder daughters Goneril and Regan display cunning deceit, while the honest Cordelia is disowned. This sets the stage for Lear's unraveling, marked by the chaotic tempest both outside and within his soul, which serves as a metaphor for his internal storm of despair and grief over his betrayal and loss.\n\n**Relationships:** Lear's relationships with his daughters are at the core of his experience. His trust in Goneril and Regan proves misguided as they strip him of the residual power and respect he hoped to retain. Cordelia, although disinherited for her honesty, remains Lear’s loyal and beloved daughter, symbolizing the untainted love he fails to recognize until it is too late. His relationship with Kent, who, despite banishment, remains loyal in disguise, reflects the enduring fidelity Lear has inspired in some, even as others betray him.\n\n**Key Decisions and Experiences:** Lear’s impulsive pronouncement to divide his kingdom based on feigned devotion sets in motion his tragic downfall. His emotional outburst against the storm symbolizes his crumbling authority and sanity, as nature mirrors his tumultuous inner reality. Suffering humiliation by his daughters—including the arrest of Kent and his own eventual capture—Lear faces the reality of his earlier blindness and folly, painfully learning the weight of betrayal and the fragility of human bonds.\n\n**Character Arc and Development:** Throughout the play, Lear transitions from a figure of majestic dominance to one broken by the raw honesty of his circumstances. His arc is one of painful enlightenment, a journey from hubris to humility as he grapples with his daughters’ treachery and his own misplaced judgments. Lear’s growing madness exposes his vulnerability, yet it also sparks moments of lucidity and philosophical reflection, as seen in profound declarations during the storm and his interactions with the fool as well as Edgar masquerading as Tom. The degeneration of power is met with a poignant yearning for redemption and understanding, culminating in the tragic reunion with Cordelia, where love and loss become irrevocably intertwined.\n\n**Impact and Legacy:** King Lear stands as a monumental example of the tragic hero, embodying the human struggle with authority, identity, and the quest for reconciliation amidst ruin. His story remains a timeless exploration of the complexities of filial love and the inevitable consequence of human pride, resonating long past the final echoes of his story."

Physically, he is not described in detail, but his royal bearing and dignified presence are evident through his actions and choices.\n\nFrance, as he is often referred to, is among the suitors present during King Lear's division of his kingdom. Unlike the superficial and calculating courtiers, France is deeply perceptive and values authenticity above material gain. This is most profoundly illustrated when, after Cordelia's refusal to embellish her love for Lear in exchange for a dowry, France remains unfazed by her lack of fortune. While the Duke of Burgundy withdraws his suit upon learning that Cordelia will not receive a share of the kingdom, France stands firm, declaring his admiration for her honesty and integrity. He says, \"Love's not love / When it is mingled with regards that stand / Aloof from the entire point.\" This willingness to marry Cordelia for her virtue alone marks France as a character driven by genuine affection and principles.\n\nHis personality is anchored by a strong sense of justice and unwavering nobility. He is both astute and compassionate, able to see beyond the surface and recognize the value of Cordelia's true character. In the political sphere, France is both decisive and strategically minded, yet his moves are guided by fairness rather than ambition or greed.\n\nIn terms of relationships, France’s primary connection in the play is with Cordelia. Their marriage, founded on mutual respect and sincerity, starkly contrasts with the manipulative dynamics observed in other characters' relationships. Their union also symbolizes a haven of truth and loyalty amidst a realm besieged by betrayal.\n\nHowever, the King of France’s involvement in the plot is relatively limited. His significant act is taking Cordelia with him to France as his queen. Later, during the climax of the play, he is alluded to as the leader of the French forces coming to aid Lear and Cordelia, underscoring his commitment to justice and support for his wife. Yet, these military undertakings are carried on in his absence as he assigns responsibilities to others, further highlighting both his influence and trust in his subordinates.\n\nThrough his noble actions and character-driven choices, the King of France remains a beacon of honor and love, providing a sharp contrast to the chaotic, self-serving energy that permeates the play. His decision to marry Cordelia for her virtues marks a pivotal moment, underscoring the play’s exploration of authenticity versus pretense. Although his role does not evolve dramatically, his steadfastness and moral clarity offer a stabilizing force in the narrative, with his marriage to Cordelia providing a glimmer of hope and integrity in a world marred by folly and treachery."

      "profile": "**Oswald**  \nOswald, the steward in service to Goneril, is a minor but pivotal character in *King Lear*, embodying the theme of loyalty corrupted by ambition. As Goneril’s trusted servant, he is characterized by his unwavering but morally dubious obedience to her commands, executing her schemes with ruthless efficiency. Oswald’s commitment to Goneril defines his role in the narrative, positioning him as an enabler of her manipulative and treacherous ambitions. His loyalty, however, is not rooted in virtue but in self-interest; he seeks to benefit from his mistress’s rise in power.\n\nOswald is depicted as opportunistic, steadfast in his duties, but morally unscrupulous. Physically, he is not described in detail by Shakespeare, but his demeanor and actions reveal a man of deliberate and calculated intent. He is cold, curt, and self-serving, carrying out his tasks with a precision that underscores his ambition to align his fortunes with Goneril’s success.\n\nOswald’s personality is defined by his dual motivations: his subservience to Goneril and his personal ambition. This makes him both a tool of her plots and an active participant in the play’s political intrigue. He shows little regard for honor or loyalty to others beyond Goneril, and he holds a particular contempt for those who stand in her way, as seen in his antagonistic encounters with Lear’s retinue and later with Gloucester and Edgar.\n\nProminent among Oswald’s actions is his defiance of King Lear, following Goneril’s instructions to treat the former king with deliberate disrespect. This sparks the initial conflict between Lear and Goneril, marking a turning point in Lear’s realization of his diminishing authority. Oswald’s cold, calculated interactions reflect the shifting power dynamics within the play, where old allegiances crumble, and opportunists thrive.\n\nOswald’s most consequential decision comes when he attempts to kill Gloucester, believing it to be his duty to eliminate an enemy of Goneril. This act demonstrates his blind loyalty to his mistress, even as her morality becomes increasingly corrupted. However, his ambition leads to his undoing. In attempting to carry out this task, Oswald is confronted and slain by Edgar, who is in disguise. With his dying breaths, Oswald attempts to secure his legacy by passing critical letters from Goneril to Edmund, revealing her plot against Albany. His final moments reiterate his self-interested pragmatism, as he hopes this information will preserve his connection to Goneril’s treacherous machinations.\n\nOswald serves as a mirror to other characters in the play, reflecting the dangers of unchecked ambition and the consequences of blind fidelity. His interactions with noble characters like King Lear, Gloucester, and Edgar highlight the stark contrast between self-serving sycophants and individuals guided by honor and virtue. His role in delivering Goneril’s incriminating letter, even inadvertently, contributes significantly to the unraveling of the larger treachery, marking his importance to the play’s resolution.\n\nIn death, Oswald reveals the peril of subjugating morality to ambition. His lack of personal values, beyond serving his mistress for personal gain, leaves him unremarkable and ultimately expendable. As a character, Oswald does not experience development or redemption; he embodies the consequences of ambition devoid of honor. His end serves as a cautionary note about the fates of those who align themselves with corrupt power."

      "profile": "Regan, the second daughter of King Lear, is a central figure in William Shakespeare's \"King Lear.\" From the very start, she is depicted as ambitious and cunning, traits she shares with her older sister, Goneril. Described as colder and more calculating than her siblings, Regan is married to the Duke of Cornwall, forming a formidable pair driven by a thirst for power.\n\nPhysically, Regan is not extensively described in the play, as Shakespeare typically focuses more on dialogue and action to flesh out his characters. However, her presence is commanding and marked by a sharp, authoritative demeanor that mirrors her inner ruthlessness.\n\nRegan's personality is defined by her desire for authority and her strategic interactions with those around her. Behind a facade of devotion and loyalty to her father, she harbors a manipulative and deceitful nature. This is exemplified early in the narrative during King Lear's test of his daughters' affection, where Regan professes an exaggerated love for Lear to secure her share of the kingdom. Her motivation lies in securing substantial power within the realm, surpassing even her sister's ambitious claims.\n\nHer relationships are fraught with deceit and competition. Regan's marriage to Cornwall creates a powerful union that reinforces her influence. Together, they are crucial players in the political machinations that follow the division of Lear's kingdom. Her relationship with her siblings, especially Goneril, is characterized by rivalry and mutual distrust, a dynamic that is manipulated expertly by characters like Edmund, who sow discord for his own ends.\n\nThroughout the play, Regan's role as a manipulative force becomes increasingly pronounced. She aligns closely with Cornwall and later with Edmund, reinforcing her political alliances through calculated support and deceit. Her unwavering ambition seeps into her relationships, driving wedges between allies as she vies for supremacy, particularly in her tense interactions with Goneril. Their shared pursuit of Edmund further deepens this rift and sets the stage for the eventual tragic unraveling of both sisters.\n\nRegan's key decisions often pivot around asserting her control and undermining Lear's authority. By denying him his retinue of knights alongside Goneril, she actively contributes to his downfall, setting off a chain of events that escalates the storm of madness and tragedy within the play. Her betrayal and maltreatment of her father further underscore her cold ambition and commitment to power consolidation.\n\nAs the narrative unfolds, Regan's arc continues its trajectory of ambition unchecked by morality. Her own jealousy and power struggle with Goneril, combined with her strategic alliances, ultimately lead to her downfall. Her growth is less of a development towards redemption and more of an exposure of the destructive potential of unchecked ambition. Her eventual demise serves as a testament to the consequences of manipulation and the tragic cost of power sought through deceit.\n\nIn \"King Lear,\" Regan remains a symbol of unbridled ambition and manipulation, embodying the play's darkest themes about the destructive nature of power and betrayal. Her legacy within the narrative is a cautionary one, her actions weaving a complex web that contributes significantly to the play's tragic outcomes."
