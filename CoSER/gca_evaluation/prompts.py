1. Read and understand the provided materials about {book}:
   * Story context and scenario.
   * Profiles of the main characters, including {major_characters}.
   * The original conversation from {book} in the same scenario as a reference.

  2. Evaluate the simulated conversation in terms of {dimension_name}, i.e., {dimension_brief}. 
   Note that, each character message is composed of speech, action (wrapped within (...) ), and inner thoughts (wrapped within [...] ). The inner thoughts are not spoken aloud and are thus invisible to other characters. 
   The detailed evaluation criteria will be provided below.

## Scenario

### Plot Summary

{plot_summary}

### Current Scenario

{scenario}

## Character Profiles

{character_profiles}

## Original Conversation

{original_conversation}

## Evaluation Criteria

To evaluate the simulated conversation, identify the following types of flaws:

{dimension_criteria}

## Scoring Guidelines

1. Identify all instances of flaws occurred in the simulated conversation.
      
2. For each flaw identified, determine its level of severity into 1 to 5, where 1 indicates minor, 3 indicates moderate, and 5 indicates severe.
   
## Output Requirements

Provide your evaluation in JSON format:
